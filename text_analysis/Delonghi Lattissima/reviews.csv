I, certainly like all of the other negative reviews, was not descaling or cleaning it properly. I also like them properly took advantage of the fact that we as first world Americans, expect everything to work perfectly, even with minimal preparation for a future working product. I originally bought a new frother and then realized it wasn't the frother, but the machine that needed descaled. I descaled the machine 3 times in a row to be sure it was good, and it worked great. I used to store the milk in the frother in the fridge, I no longer do this. I have learned the amount I need and I dump any remaining back into the carton. I then rinse the frother in three parts, the container, the head, and the straw. I then turn the head upside down and dump water into the head unit until the milk color goes away out of the tip of it. I then take RO water and run it through a milk cycle with that to he sure it has no milk in the system. No matter how good their self cleaning system is, it will fail over time because of the starchy characteristics of milk. So why wait for it to let you down, clean it every time (takes 2 min additional max) and enjoy an amazing coffee each and every time.

I wanted a value but I wanted something easy to use and clean. We narrowed our search down to machines using Nespresso pods. The we looked at specs and reviews and this one stood out and once delivered did not disappoint. The assembly was easy and instructions pretty easy to follow. With a little experimentation we found that for our taste and for the right size we used two pods instead of one to gain coffee strength. We started with the Lungo setting which is larger than the espresso setting. The with another pod we did the cappuccino setting. It was the right amount of whole milk for us and it fit comfortably into a normal sized coffee cup. The milk dispenser cleans after every use and the pods are stored in the interior. The front comes out to drain the basin and remove the used pods and goes back easily. So far we recommend the dark roast pods like Roma, Arpeggio, and Ristretto. You do get a 14 pod sampler with the machine that gives you a wide choice of coffees. We haven't tried the Latte setting which is more milk but we will. Let me add that the machine is not so big that it takes up a lot of counter space and of course you can make regular coffee also. Mornings became a lot more fun.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

Make sure you buy pods with it.,"I really like  this machine.  In addition to the six pre-programmed coffee drinks, you can also use the milk button to put frothed milk into the cup AFTER you brew the espresso to make a more traditional latte.  It's very versatile. The frother is a nice touch and you can store any unused milk in the fridge.  My only gripe is that it's impossible to find a spare milk frother and they recommend you wash it in your dishwasher every two days. I'm not sure about you, but I don't run the dishwasher every other day, which means I end up cleaning it by hand and even then that requires soaking everything in hot water and soap for 30 minutes.  If I had a spare milk jug, then I could put one in the dishwasher while having a clean one on hand.The machine itself is a nice well built, heavy and made out of stainless steel.  It warms up in less than 30 seconds and makes great espressos and coffee drinks.  I've tried all three types of drinks and even made my own tasty double espresso caramel lattes without any issues.  Be aware of the intensity of the espresso you order since making a Latte with anything less than 6 is going to taste more like flavored milk than coffee unless you add multiple shots which can make your per-cup cost go up.  Some varieties work better as a Cappuccino and of course all the ristretto/espresso/yungo shots I've had all came out well.The interface is easy to use.  Just press a button and coffee (and milk if you're making a Latte/Cappuccino) comes out ready to drink.  Of course you can add a pump or two of syrup if you want, or just add sugar if you like it sweet.  You can adjust the amount of milk/coffee for each drink if you want.  The Milk button is handy if you want to fill larger mug.A problem I did have was my first one was one of the ""Used - Very Good"" Amazon warehouse deal.  Fortunately I was smart and ordered a new one, just in case...and I'm glad I did.  The ""Used"" one (which wasn't used, just packaged up in a different box) didn't come with the pod sampler and because I couldn't get the coffee until Monday, I wouldn't have had anything to use it with for an entire weekend.  So I boxed up the warehouse deal one and sent it back.  So please be aware that you probably wont get any coffee with the machine if you order from their warehouse deals.I'm docking this one star, because one of the things nobody tells you in reviews is that unless you won the lottery and live near one of their very scarce Nespresso boutique locations you will only find genuine Nespresso pods online.  I thought I would be able to go down to Bed, Bath and Beyond and find them there.  The only Nespresso-compatible pods you might manage to find locally are the Cafepresso pods at Walmart or the Starbucks pods at Kroger (which were sold out at the one near me).  Even the places where they sell the machine locally like Williams Sonoma and Sur La Table don't sell the pods which is ridiculous.  In the sampler, they give you one of each of their varieties, and it was disappointing to find a flavor I loved and not be able to get more until the next week.  So I suggest you order some pods you might think you'll like along with the machine and understand you'll be most likely ordering all the coffee for it online.  I have no problem with that, but I wish I would have known ahead of time since I ended up getting the machine on a Friday.So if you do order this, make sure you order early enough that you can get the machine and the coffee at the same time.  Start with the Ristretto or the Arpeggio which taste more like traditional espresso and are strong enough to make into a Cappuccino or a Latte until you can order a welcome pack from Nespresso which comes with free gifts.TLDR:Good, versatile machine.  Provides easy access to coffee drinks and espressos.  Frother works well.  Just make sure you buy coffee online along with the machine, because more than likely nobody will sell it anywhere near where you live.Edit: After about a year, I now wish we would have gotten a Creatista instead.  The issue is that this requires you to store unused milk in the fridge and since I'm mostly a weekend coffee drinker, I've had too much unused milk go bad.  The milk frother that this comes with has several parts and is a bit of a pain to wash.  With the Creatista I could have just washed the jug out and stored it instead.  I'll eventually be replacing this machine with a Creatista.  It's probably more just a personal preference thing.",8 people found this helpful,Yes

It seemed that reviews were 50/50 regarding hotter drinks on the Pro model. Since I enjoyed the flavors of the coffee and convenience of the Nespresso Lattissima+, I bit the bullet, spent the extra money and ordered the Pro. Result? Milk based drinks are the same as the Lattissima +, NOT hotter.Oh well. I am still keeping the Lattissima Pro for the following reasons:1. Love the extra features - especially the hot water feature for my hot cocoa when I come home from work at midnight. I add the frothy milk and the temperature, although not hot,hot, is fine for me.2. I found that if I take the milk container out of the fridge about 20 minutes or so before using (get the major chill off), the milk based drinks are noticeably hotter.3.

The touch screen menu on top does not give you much of an idea of what you are selecting until after you've made your choice, and then all you know is the Italian name for the drink. That is find for cappuccino.  What is ""ristretto"" or ""lungo?""  There is a help system in English, but it is kind of a joke.  It has two topics only: 1) ""internet"" (which only gives the web site for Nespresso) and 2) ""milk froth advice"" which advises non fat milk, cold, and regular cleaning.  Definitions for the different drinks might be nice, or you might request something that won't fit in the cup you are using.In the photos I have attached, the new Lattissima is the silver unit on the left.  Both units have capsules that seem to be identical in front of them, but after using any of my old ones, I get only hot water and the bottom foil is dented but not pierced.Overall, I think this is a very nice unit, but be prepared to figure it out largely for yourself. If you have already bought consumables, you may found that your investment is wasted and the company will not even offer a thank you for the donation or a ""that's too bad"" with a sad emoji in response.",One person found this helpful,Yes

One big pro is the Milk dispenser you can store in the fridge.  This was my main reason for purchasing this over other nespresso machines.  Iâve gotten a decent froth from it.  Since I only use plant based milks, my expectations are low.  Also, I only use bottled water so I canât really speak to build up or scaling.  I would recommend only using nespresso pods as I have heard some of the other ones get stuck in machines.  This machine is loud but I believe all these machines have this issue.

Absolutely no regrets with this purchase,"Absolutely awesome.  Absolutely no regrets with this purchase, and I'm absolutely addicted to this product.If I were to roll back time, the only thing I would do differently is use distilled water from the start. I noticed 'rings' in the transparent plastic water tank that attaches to the back of this unit after about 1 month of usage.  That was completely my own fault because I was using tap water.  After carefully cleaning the tank, I started using distilled water and never had the issue reoccur.  The company also sells a cleaning solution to run through the machine but I have not done that yet, after about 4 months of ownership.When I enjoy an espresso from this machine, I am reminded of my travels to Italy.  The visions of those trips flash through my mind as I enjoy a drink from my De'Longhi.  YES, it is that good, and NO I have not been paid to say that.  I have no affiliation with the manufacturer, Nespresso,  whatsoever.BTW - ""Coffee"" in Italy is what Americans call ""Espresso"". The concoction that we Americans call ""Coffee"" is called ""American Coffee"" in Italy, or in some cases ""Lungo"".  A Lungo is basically just an Espresso with 2x-3x the water during the brew.  Nespresso uses the term ""Lungo"" and if you choose that drink from the touch-panel, the machine will default to using 2x the amount of water as compared to an Espresso (but you can increase or decrease that ratio based on your own preference).The espresso/lungo/cappuccino pods are on the expensive side but nothing beats it without spending 2-3X on a commercial machine and sourcing your own beans. Nespresso also routinely offers special/limited-time blends that are quite good.  These specials cost a bit more, but they are a real treat.  The first limited-time blend I bough was with much reservation because I had a hard time paying extra for those pods.  It was the Brazil-origin pod.  I bought two ""sleeves"" (a Nespresso ""sleeve"" is a cardboard box with 10 pods in it).  Now, many weeks later & after the Brazil pods are no longer sold, I find myself saving the remaining pods for special occasions.  Nespresso even offered a Cuba-origin pod when the American-Cuban embargo was lifted.  I regret not buying a pod or three.YES, it is that good!WARNING:  If you are currently addicted to Starbucks, you will loose your desire to shop there. Perhaps if you are away from home and in jam you will pass through in an attempt to fill a void... but you will be longing for Nespresso.For absolute & full transparency, I do have one concern about this machine:  The espresso/coffee/cappuccino pours from an output nozzle attached to the machine, above your cup.  That means your espresso has contact with the equipment, albeit briefly.  As evidence, when your done brewing your cup, and after you have ejected the used pod (coffee capsule) from the machine, the nozzle will still continue to drip a few times. Those drips are from coffee/espresso draining from the physical machine (not the coffee pod).  In an ideal situation your brew would not come in contact with the machine.  Any contact at all means residue can build up and/or mix with prior brews, and even attract contaminants like bacteria.  Some other machines like the Flavia solve that problem (the Flavia is awesome for ""American Coffee"" but sucks for espresso and cappuccino) and others suffer the same fate (Keurig does the same thing, but much worse.. even gross).  Nespresso has  a 'cleaning cycle' that they suggest you use to overcome this concern. The cleaning cycle is run with regular water but with no coffee pod inserted.  However, it's a real inconvenience (you have to use a 2nd cup for the runoff, and go through a procedure) so I doubt most owners do it after each cup brewed. BUT IT DOES MATTER: When I run my De'Longhi in ""cleaning mode"" on any given day with NO coffee pod inserted, it will produce brown or gray water.  That is decisive evidence that contamination is present. In fact, the water wont turn clear until I run the cleaning mode for 3-5 times consecutively.Despite this one concern, I have found nothing better for practical home use. I would buy again in a heartbeat!",9 people found this helpful,Yes

Love this machine. Slight learning curve and then it's smooth sailing. Pulling a shot with no capsule helps to get it heated up more (obviously not in your coffee cup). I'm learning more about espresso and that's fun.I bought it through Amazon Warehouse deals for almost $100 less and it is in perfect condition (in case anyone ever wonders about that). I called Asurian and was told I could purchase a replacement plan if bought through Amazon Warehouse, so I did. The only downside was that the sample pods were not included. I contacted Amazon and worked out a Prime credit for $5 but had to wait a few extra days for an order of the pods to arrive.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

I liked the idea of saving money in the long run plus the convenience of making it at home and ability to tailor my drinks. My initial budget was $200 but after reading the Amazon reviews I decided to spend the extra money. This machine is well worth it. The pros - it's truly a user friendly all in one machine, 6 different drink choices including option of just warm milk, easy programmable option for volume of each drink that is then stored in memory, automatic cleaning after any milk based drink, great quality and variety of espresso pods, the pods are recyclable, temperature of drinks is about 150 degrees which is perfect in my book. The cons - none that I have seen. I ordered my Lattissima through Amazon Warehouse and saved a little over 20% on the price which helped a lot. The item came in pretty much mint condition with all the manuals and sampler pods.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

My main gripe with that machine was that the lattes didn't come out hot enough. I had to microwave my lattes for about 15-20 seconds after they were made with the Latissima Plus. It doesn't sound like a big deal but it becomes a pain when you have to do it everyday, not to mention the coffee's taste definitely gets altered a bit when you do that. The whole reason I got the unit was to REDUCE the steps it took to create the perfect latte at home and not have to fork over $5 at Starbucks/other coffee shops every time I wanted a latte.I was crossing my fingers when I ordered this unit as there were mixed answers to the golden question: Does the coffee/latte come out hot enough or just somewhat hot/warm like the Latissima Plus. Well I can now safely say I'm glad I took the chance and gave this new unit a try--it definitely is hot enough and hotter than the Latissima plus! No more microwaving! Finally I can get the perfect latte at home with minimal steps.As usual Nespresso's pods provide a good variety and quality is spot on. The unit itself looks a lot more substantial and premium than the Latissima Plus. Putting the two side by side, the Latissima Plus looks like the Pro's kid brother. I love that the milk and water container have a bigger capacity. The digital display also makes it really easy to use and program everything to your preference.The one thing I wish I could do is set the milk volume higher. It has a limit of about 6.8 oz. Not a huge deal though.Here's the max programming volume for each of the settings in case you were wondering:Water volume can be programmed from 50 to 400 ml (1.7 to 13.5 oz).Milk volume can be programmed from 30 to 200 ml (1 to 6.8 oz).Coffee volume can be progammed from 25 to 200 ml (0.85 to 6.8 oz).Overall this is the perfect unit and I'm glad I caught it at a great deal on Amazon. Keep an eye on the product page for this unit on Amazon, price for this unit seems to fluctuate frequently. I bought it at $485, but 1 week earlier it was $449, and now it's $599 just a few days later. The $100 Nespresso offer, sweetens the deal even more. The fact that you can make several different types of coffees/lattes/cappuccinos at home so easily makes this machine worth its cost. After taking into account the cost of milk, the capsule, syrup flavoring, and all the little things, you can make a perfect latte for about $2 or less. Starbucks charges like $4-$5 for a small cup, so it's easy to see that you will recover the cost of the machine fairly quickly.If you are debating between buying the Latissima Pro or Latissima Plus -- BUY THE PRO, it is significantly better and the difference in price is justified in the long run.If you are on the fence between upgrading or keeping your Latissima Plus for the Pro -- UPGRADE, it is a significant upgrade.Hope this helps.",11 people found this helpful,Yes

I've been using this coffee maker almost every day, multiple times a day, for over two months.  I LOVE IT!  Previously, I had a Keurig Rivo.  That was my first espresso machine, and I enjoyed it while it worked.  However, eventually, I had the same problem so many other people have had, in that it quit puncturing the cups.  After fighting with it for about a year, I threw it in the trash.  I then starting looking for a replacement.  I wanted a similar machine that would froth the milk and make the espresso without the need for two separate appliances.  After reading reviews, I decided on the Latissima Pro because 1) it not only froths the milk, but it also puts the milk directly in the cup!, 2) you can store the milk in the frothing pitcher, which is so much more convenient than having to empty and wash out the milk container after each use, and 3) it has an optional self-cleaning mode that rinses the nozzle of the milk frother after every use.  Now that I've been using the Lattissima, I also appreciate how hot the coffee and milk are (much hotter than the Keurig!), and I like the adjustable setting on the frother, which allows me to decide with each cup how much foam I want.  Also, the Nespresso pods are delicious.  This machine is also smaller than the Keurig and fits better on my counter.  Having the water container in the back gives it a polished, streamlined look.  So far, there is nothing I don't like about this machine.",N/A,No

BUT it's possible to find this and other Besoressos at significant discounts. We managed a 35 percent discount from list by combining a base discount with a store credit card discount.We didn't need another credit card but for this it gave us an additional discount and free shipping,We bought coffee capsules in Europe where prices are substantially less than the US, genuine or knockoffs aka compatible.It is versatile, does a big range of whatever. Works well. FWIW, De'Longhi is a partner with Nespresso, there are others, but Nespresso is careful. In our area there are Nespresso Boutiques that sell coffee but not machines, that is a different sales function handled by local stores, I.e. Bloomingdales covers both.

It's also De'Longhi's top of the line machine. Let me just say that I am a big Nespresso fan, and already own a Nespresso Pixie model. But my Nespresso Pixie is rather basic, while also being very cool looking, and is only a straight espresso maker, no frills, no milk frother, etc. When the chance came along to try the De'Longhi EN750MB I was eager to check it out and to see how well the milk frothing feature worked.First off, the machine is ""more"" in many areas: a much bigger water reservoir, easily twice the volume of the Pixie, a bigger used pods drawer, and of course the frother. The unit makes a very good impression with lots of metal where cheap Keurig style machines -- nothing that a serious coffee hound would consider anyway -- have acres of plastic. The De'Longhi has a very good quality feel. The distance from the output spout to the cup is large enough to accommodate a largish latte style cup -- De'Longhi has figured out that Americans tend to drink coffee drinks more than straight espresso. But there is also a drop down platform that allows a smaller espresso style cup to nuzzle just under the spout. The top of the unit has a very nicely laid out and very legible visual display of the various coffee pod and milk modes. Using the machine couldn't be easier, especially if you have previous Nespresso experience.Where the De'Longhi really shines is in the milk frother. As you may have noticed, commercial espresso machines, and home machine styled after commercial machines, have steam wands to heat and froth milk, that draw steam and pressure from the same boiler that also delivers high pressure hot water to the coffee portafilter used for those machines. That's great for a cafe or bar where the machine is going all day. But it's a bit of a chore to clean up after just one session, and the steam wand system can be a bit of a user learning curve and craft issue to use. The De'Longhi has a very ingenious and easy to use system for both frothing milk, storing the milk, and solving the clean up problem.The De'Longhi uses a front mounted removable milk container, that can be taken off the machine and placed in the fridge in between uses. Rather than forcing steam through the milk the De'Longhi milk container has a cap that ties into the steam system and siphons milk from the container up into the cap, where it is mixed with steam and output as pre-frothed milk into your cup. The amount of frothing is adjustable, the frothing top assembly is dishwasher safe, and the whole thing can be removed from the machine and left in the fridge in between sessions. It worked well for me, and dishwasher safe aspect of the milk container cap assembly is a big plus.I am happy with my De'Longhi America EN750MB Lattissima Pro Nespresso system coffee machine. It will take the place of my Nespresso Pixie, but that's just good news for my office, where the Pixie will be relocated. All good. De'Longhi EN750MB is a serious option for Nespresso buyers looking to move up to a machine featuring higher capacity water reservoir and a great milk frother.

You get the option to make 5 coffee types however the size of the drink appears very small. I often use two shots of espresso to get a decent sized latte and cappuccino. After using this for a few months now, I do wish I had a coffee machine with coffee beans grinder so I am not restricted to the coffee pods. The self clean feature is handy however I donât think it justifies the price difference between this and the lattissima plus.The coffee pods are great however you might find yourself bored after a while.Overall, if you are looking for a quick hassle free drink with the option to make cappuccino, lattes, etc - this is an excellent machine with daily small footprint.",N/A,No

I noticed on the touch that it was under 140 (138 F). However, the salesperson made me a very short drink so it is possible that the thermometer did not register as high because only the tip and about an inch was immersed. The few degrees does seem to make a difference, but I would recommend testing this yourself. I don't know that my N of 1 study is valid, but it does seem to fit with what others are writing.For me, the drinks are hot enough coming out of the Pro but I am drinking cappuccino and expect to drink it fairly quickly. If you were making something with a lot of milk, I guess it could be an issue. However, the machine is certainly capable of getting very hot water - think milk would burn at 170 but I am not an expert. Hope this helps all of you mulling the temperature issue.The convenience of the cleaning mode on the Pro makes it worth it to me to spend the extra $, but if I were trying to save money I might go with one of the smaller nespresso machines. But cost of pods is the real issue long term not the machines themselve.",8 people found this helpful,No

While I loved the product, there were a fewthings that left me disappointed. However, with this product, none of these issues  exists.The very first issue I had was the coffee would not get hot enough. With this model that is not a problem. Youget a steaming hot cup. Clearly this is a far more expense model so I was pleased to see the addition of theon screen directions. There is a small angled screen that guides you through the process of making your cup.The font is clear and instructions are easy to follow.One of the other issues I had with the lower model is the milk tube didn't self clean.  With this model, the milktube is cleaned. The reason this is a great feature is because unless you clean the milk tube every day by runningthe tube through hot water, it will begin to smell like sour milk although you must keep it in the fridge. In the lower model the tube is also very difficult to clean. So a self cleaning tube saves you a lot of headache.I also love the adapter for hot tea. I love both tea and coffee and so being able to get the benefit of bothwith one machine is great.  I also prefer that this model has a rounded milk carafe as opposed to the squareone in the lower model.  This model also has  a low water indicator and shuts down all operation until the waterlevel is filled to the appropriate level.The coffee selection is great! I love all of the coffees. I have ordered directly from Nespresoo and for less than 7 dollars ifI order on Monday, I have the coffee by Wed.  The coffee is a bit pricey, but they often run specials on new bundledflavors.  They regularly develop new flavors so you don't get board.  The only disappointment I had with theflavors is I did not find a difference between drinking their regular and their decaff.The machine itself is beautiful and fits nicely on my counter.  I'm very happy with this model.",2 people found this helpful,No

First of all it looks great on the countertop. Sleek brushed metal finish built like a tank. Second it makes great espresso and the milk frother is easy to put on and off. You can store the milk frother in the fridge when you are not using it. The control screen is easy to use and it makes terrific coffee. I find myself making a lot of milk froth drinks, espresso and cappuccinoâs because it is so easy to use. Iâve had a number of these Nespresso machines and this by far is the best one. It may be pricey but you get what you pay for. In this case you get a top-of-the-line machine that looks good and works well. It is really worth the money and highly recommend it.  I should add that itâs easy to clean and weâve had absolutely no problems with it. Itâs not finicky at all. So spend the money and get Nespressoâs best machine. Donât waste your money on the lower models or any of their other machines. This is the one to get.",N/A,No
