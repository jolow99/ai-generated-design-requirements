Garrood,N/A,3.0 out of 5 stars,the United Kingdom,"November 13, 2021",N/A,"I bought this to replace an older De'Longhi coffee maker that had served well for about 7-8 years. That was also a replacement of an even older De'Longhi machine bought about 18 years ago. The new Stilosa is as near as I could get for a like-for-like replacement. Like many an improved version, this is not as good. It is less easy to use, the original 3 coffee filter cups are replaced by 2, neither of which suit a single cup or a mug, or 2 servings, the steamer control is less straightforward but worst of all, it doesn't make a hot cup of coffee. It is essential to heat the cup first and then halfway through making a coffee it is necessary to stop the process to allow the water heater to come back to temperarture. For the cost of the machine, this is a pretty poor result. If this machine pops its clogs before I do then I won't be replacing it with another De'Longhi. If you want hot coffee then look elsewhere.",One person found this helpful,Yes

I'll assume it was an oversight, but that did make things take a good half hour to then work out.First time usage, you had to run a load of water through the filter and frothing system. This did originally make a lot of loud, bad sounding noises, but after a while, it did settle down to the more re-assuring noise of high pressured steam and water.This machine requires ground coffee and cannot grind the beans. The scoop also has a built in tamper - which is used to pack the coffee down into the basket. Unfortunately because it's made of plastic, it doesn't have such a good feel, and you do worry you can't press down as hard in case you break something (though it never did happen).I did find the portafilter handle very hard to place into the machine fully, it was almost like it didn't quite fit. It meant you ended up holding the machine with one hand whilst trying to twist the handle in properly with the other.The milk frothing was a lot easier to do, and after a bit of practice it wasn't too hard to get a decent froth out of itPros- Can make a decent coffee- Decent milk frothingCons- Can be fiddly and auite hard work- The tamper is made of plastic- The handle was hard to fit properly into the machine- Instructions were missing- no milk frothing jub providedIn summary: It's not a perfect machine, but if you perservere, you can get a reasonably good expresso or cappucino out of this machine. Given the cost is £99, it sounds expensive, but given you can easily spend several times that for higher end machines, despite the learning curve, the resultcan be good for the money.",8 people found this helpful,No

What sort of coffee does it make?It took longer than expected to answer that question.  No matter how many times I removed and re-inserted the (plastic) water container, it just wouldn't fit properly, with the result that it took a ridiculous number of attempts and time before I finally even managed to get water to flow through the machine.In my opinion, the quality control was severely lacking here.When I finally got to make my coffee, I have to admit that I was so prejudiced against this machine that it may have put me in an overly-critical frame of mind.  And maybe if I'd stuck with this machine I'd have decided that the coffee wasn't so poor after all.But the bottom line is that I really, REALLY disliked this machine.

The main coffee dispenser also makes a large noise when dispensing coffee.Apart from the noise of the machine, it’s performance isn’t the best either. I placed 2 spoonfuls of ground coffee (freshly ground) and pressed the dispense function (after having heated it all through as per instructions), and at first the coffeee looked good dripping out, but very quickly it went to very weak loooing coffee).The resulting coffee was weak and not great tasting. I am coming from using a french press and separate milk frother which makes excellent tasting coffees. With this and using the exact same beans, the resulting coffee is just nowhere near as nice.

YouTube can also help as there are plenty of videos showing how to use machines like this  as they are all quite similar and can be very useful if you have never used a machine like this before (I have only ever used pod machines at home). I must say the water heats up very quickly and is easy to refill!After getting to grips with the set up of the machine however, making a hot beverage is fairly straightforward. I love how it can use ground coffee or the ESE pods. So far I have made espresso’s, americano’s, cappuccino’s, flat whites and occasionally milky hot chocolates with the milk frother - which also makes a great crema on the coffees. I haven’t actually attempted the pods yet myself but the concept is appealing. I have also purchased a coffee bean grinder to experiment with different beans and flavours.It appears elegant and is an attractive appliance to have on your kitchen worktop. I think it is a good entry level machine for those that want something to make fresh coffee at home, however from other reviews I have read I do have my doubts on how long this machine will last before it starts to get common faults such as leaking.

I am using a more expensive brand of beans, which produces a much better crema.I really like Delonghi espresso machines - I find they survive well in hard water areas. Even though they have mainly plastic bodies, the insides are the same as the expensive brands, and I have always got great cuos of coffee from them.This one has a few extras that you don't get with the basic model: there's an on/off rocker switch - it also turns off if not in use.  The water tank is lift-out, which is great, as taking it to the sink to fill is a lot easier than having to use a jug.You don't need a pressure gauge - a green light comes on when the correct pressure has been reached; also when the water has reached the right temperature to pass through the coffee.The frother is on the right-hand side - something to bear in mind if you're placing it in a corner. All the others I've had have had it on the left.The main reason I'm not giving this a higher rating is because I can't get a good crema from it - I've tried grinding the beans coursely, finely, and everything in between, but no joy. I think this is because the metal cup that you put the coffee in has been changed from the design that they used to have - it's now missing a rubber layer inside, and looks and feels cheaper; maybe they've cut costs there. This might not be the reason why, of course. Whatever the reason, I'm not happy with the resulting brew.So I can only give it three stars.

This isn’t the flashiest tamper but it works perfectly well and is the perfect fit for the coffee basket.In use I got a steady stream of coffee and no leaks or escaping grinds, I like to use a half pint mug with a double shot and topped up with steamed milk, my half pint mug is too big for the gap between the coffee basket and the base of the machine, I get round this by using an espresso mug and decanting this into my mug, it’s not an issue and if you use a smaller cup you won’t have any problems, but if you like a big drink this is a good way around the issue.If you like an americano you can top up with hot water from the steam wand by simply choosing the water option.All things considered this is decent machine, it doesn’t have all the flashy extras that some others have but it produces a decent coffee never the less and the price point is a lot less than some of the more complex machines.",N/A,No

   This coffee ☕  machine will make a lovely espresso,  cappuccino,  hot milk or hot water for you.It is fairly easy to use but as you can see in the video 📹 some activities aren't easy to perform.For eg: putting on the handle and removing it (you have to hold the machine down to do it properly. Perhaps this is only due to it being totally new and will loosen up a little with use ).It also doesn't have huge water container (but it is compact machine in all honsty).It is small enough to fit in even the smallest of kitchens, takes as much space as a kettle (and replaces it as it can give you hot water).Operation is fairly easy, it has only 3 buttons.It comes with instruction booklet that is easy to underatand/read and follow.Coffee taste will of course depends on the type of coffee you use.The handle comes with 2 coffee compartments (small and big for 1 or 2 esspresso at a time). One of which can be in use and the other hidden next to water compartment.There are 2 taps as in most of the coffee machines, and a tray to collect spills.Overall this machine will give you everything you need from a coffee machine on a budget. But I would recommend it to a single person or a couple as it is a little hustle to make a lot of coffees ☕ in 1 go (for this I prefer bean to cup machine).That being said this machine comes with traditional De'Longhi quality and great design.I think it is definitely 👍 worth the money 💰 💰.",N/A,No

Firstly the handle that you remove to put the coffee in is REALLY difficult to lock into place. You have to use so much force that the whole machine starts sliding all over the place and even then it doesn't go in with the handle facing straight sometimes. This would render this machine completely unusable to elderly people as even I struggle-I attempted to read/follow the instructions but they are useless and just show pictures with no text. This is despite sending multiple booklets in a wide variety of languages for things like the warranty, but the actually instructions are just pictures that lack information. I have personally never used one of these machines and the instructions give next to no advice on making the drinks. There is a metal attachment that may be compatible with some brand/size pods? but again the instructions don't say which ones-I literally got stuck on the first step which was to fill the tank with water and flush the system out before use. I filled it up, switched it on and.... nothing. Despite following those simple instructions perfectly it was almost as if the machine was faulty/broken, there was just a light dribble at best which came out and also the same from the milk frother. It was very loud and vibrated so much that the glass I had underneath was moving around. When I did finally get it working a few days later - after around 10 attempts and chatting to De'Longhi support the pump seems weak and doesn't flow out very fast as if it's struggling. After a quick Google search there seemed to be quite a lot of people having issues with the pumps. Plus I found that the machine only seemed to work when the tank was filled up to the max and the flow got even weaker as the water run lower, like the pump relied on the weight of the water to push it through the system.-For anyone that likes their drinks piping hot, this machine will massively disappoint. I've only recently got into drinking hot drinks and when I make them from the kettle or my other Dolce Gusto machine I have to wait 10 minutes for them to cool before I can drink them. I found I could almost drink them instantly from this machine-I attempted to contact De'Longhi support, the phone line is open 9am - 5:30pm and the online live webchat is online between 9am-4:30pm Mon - Thur and until 12 noon on Fridays. These are the hours I'm at work so was disappointed to not see an email option. As a result I was forced to use the webchat service on my phone at work without the machine in front of me and working at the same time. A blue message bubble only pops up on the screen when someone is available. It took almost 30 min of trying just for the message bubble to finally appear on the screen. Then when it finally did open I sent the first message  and it took a whopping 45 MINUTES just to get the first reply and there was no nice greeting or apology for the wait, just more of a 'Whats the issue?' kind of attitude. Then every single reply after that took anywhere between 5 - 15 minutes. I explained that I received the item to test and post a review within a time period and that I'm not sure if it is broken. The only advice they gave was to keep trying and send a video on webchat 4 days later after the weekend and bank holiday had passed. I was using the webchat on a Friday and almost dead on 12 noon the assistant seemed to just get up and leave the computer without replying to me. The webchat ended itself because it timed out due to the person I was talking to not replying for such a long period of time. Completely and utterly rude!I was asked to leave feedback after ending the chat and obviously left a poor rating and bad comment. It comes to no surprise that I was not contacted after leaving that chat feedback. Although that's probably down the the fact that they don't to email contact with customers, just as the chat assistant confirmed-The machine was just a complete disappointment and the instructions were useless. That combined with the frankly useless support team means I don't plan to buying anything De'Longhi in the future. Wouldn't recommend this machine or the support team one bit",One person found this helpful,No

Why it smells unpleasantly.I never used any espresso machine before, are plastic pieces inevitable in those parts of the design?As of now, because my expectation was all stainless steel pieces insides contacting hot coffee or milk, instead of plastic pieces with unpleasant smell, I have to give 1 star review until all these questions are addressed.",215 people found this helpful,Yes

Not like the industrial ones I used to use when I worked at Starbucks but still super easy and makes great tasting espresso.I got this as a Christmas present and have been using almost everyday for about a month now. I feel I have finally perfected the making a great latte with this.Everyday I empty the espresso grounds, take apart the espresso filter and place it in a glass with a couple of drops of liquid dawn and then shake the glass and rinse it out until there aren't any bubbles anymore. I wash the large metal piece separately by hand and rinse out the part that holds the complete filter.After I use the steam wand I make sure to put more steam through until there are clear water droplets falling off of the end. Once a week I take of the metal steam wand cover and wipe down the rubber part on the inside.I love lattes so the steam wand was a must for me. It works really well, just takes a little longer to heat the milk up, but I take mine straight from the fridge.All in all the process takes me less than 5 minutes, including waiting for everything to heat up.

The espresso shot that I pulled ended up being really nice. But mostly because I tuned it with the dose of the coffee grinds and how fine/course the beans were grinded. Also of course didn’t happen on the first try. I had to time the shots and everything. So basically the espresso part of it is pretty nice for the price of the machine but with some manual fine tuning of course.Unfortunately the steaming wand didn’t do it for me. It was hard because I am used to using machines at work that are thousands of dollars so I can’t really compare this to that however, the wand just really sucks. It is literally meant for a barely warm cappuccino. The temperature never got to hot but it created lots of bubbles. Also sometimes when I would turn on the steaming feature, it would be strong but then other times it would be really weak. Never consistent.If anyone is curious, the size tamper you need is 51 mm. I had to buy 3 different ones to find the right size because the machine comes with a plastic one.I ended up returning this machine unfortunately.",145 people found this helpful,Yes

   Got this product and I am amazed on how well it makes espresso. I like to drink espresso straight or as an americano, so I have never used the milk steamer but will update this review when I use it. Highly recommend this brand for a budget espresso maker since it is a reputable name.UPDATE: Steaming wand works well, what you can expect out of a machine under $100. While this machine is cheap, I feel that it is cheap in the things that DONT matter for a high-quality espresso drink. I also suggest that you buy espresso coffee or grind your own beans (into a fine ground) for the best taste. If you are frothing milk (and don't have a lot of experience doing it) use whole milk. The foam and cream-like texture of the milk will be more prevalent in milk with higher fat contents. Enjoy everyone!",119 people found this helpful,Yes

All I knew about espresso before purchasing is how to order the drink I wanted so I definitely didn't want to spend a crazy amount of money but also knew I wasn't interested in something that was going to make a less authentic drink like a pod style machine (nespresso).  So today is the first time I have used it. Takes a little time to set up, no big deal, but also more time than I was expecting to actually produce a shot of espresso... ok I can live with that...My initial plan was like ok I'll just make a couple shots & have an iced latte every day but now I feel like that may not be realistic.  I grabbed some (cheap) cafe bustelo at the store to give the machine a try, I realize there's way better espresso out there. Anyway, I made my husband and I a cappuccino & it was actually great for my very first time ever, we were pretty impressed! It actually tasted like what you'd order at a coffee shop, I guess I lucked out getting the milk/espresso ratio correct.  Wasn't too hard to use or figure out.  HOWEVER, A few things to note... first- there's a reserve tank of water in the machine and to make a shot, you either put the filter in made for one shot or two and just measure one or two scoops out of espresso and turn the knob, pretty simple.  BUT you have to manually decide when to turn the knob back aka it doesn't stop (like a coffee pot) once your shot(s) has been made  ... so basically it would run the entire reserve tank of water through unless you turn the knob back & I had no clue how to determine when to do that as a first time user, just had to guess based on how much was in the glass.  Which brings me to my next point- it does not come with any espresso shot glasses which would have been helpful to measure & better judge when to shut it off.  I just used a coffee cup which was almost too big to fit under the nozzle, not ideal.  Anyway, something I didn't realize I needed to buy separately.  Also, cleanup is NOT a breeze. It's not like making a pot of coffee and you just dump the basket and filter when you're done... because the filters are reusable in this machine you have to basically disassemble that whole part to rinse it & I'm talking remove it from the machine, scoop out and dump the grounds, unscrew the bottom, pop 4 separate pieces out of the filter, rinse each one separately, dry them off and then reassemble.  I just don't know if I was prepared to do all that every single day when in a hurry to get out of the house.  Plus if you want to use the milk frother daily you're doing even more cleaning- you have to run hot water through it then take it apart and rinse it as well after each use.  Which reminds me, I will also have to buy a milk frothing glass because that was not included and I need something that can measure for me otherwise I'm just guessing on that too.  Ok so all that being said, even the cheap espresso my first time using tasted great.  I know it will take some practice to get used to, I was just hoping it would be an easier replacement for my morning cup of coffee or spending $5 at Starbucks daily.  I am now looking into purchasing the ESE pods that can also be used in this machine instead of ground espresso... I didn't factor this expense in, they're around $35-$50 for 150 count which isn't ideal but it may be worth it if it saves time on cleanup and I can have my iced latte every day",66 people found this helpful,Yes

I had a very expensive delonghi at home years ago too. I’ve used a French press and moka pot for a long time but was really missing the taste of real espresso and good strong foam on milk. This machine delivers! You control the pull, so you get it exactly as strong as you want. The steamer is perfect for milk (though I wish the wand had a little more free range of motion*- still, it’s fine). Others complained about it not being big enough to fit a large cup- I use a 16 oz polish pottery mug for milk, pull the espresso into a short pitcher, steam right in the mug, and pour the coffee in - just the way it’s suppose to work. Read the manual -a few steps were not entirely intuitive, but simple enough). Key: pull the espresso first, then steam the milk- otherwise coffee tastes burned. No problem. Be sure to use good coffee, with a more course grind than fine. I use Lavazza cream e gusto and it’s perfect. You can certainly spend more on a machine for more bells and whistles, but this makes a great espresso, cappuccino, latte, hot water for tea faster than a kettle, even hot chocolate (powder mix added to milk and steamed).

So when I found this gem I didn’t hesitate. Using the same ground espresso, there is an incredible difference in quality from my old ‘Mini’ to this new ‘Stilosa.’ The espresso is smooth and creamy, with perfect crema. The stainless steel thermoblock takes longer to heat the water than does the aluminum one in the ‘mini’ and the entire ritual / process takes longer, you do have to mind it, not just push a button and walk away. But…. I’d not trade the quality of the end product for a faster process…no way!!!Here’s a helpful hint, if you have favorite cups already, know the clearance space is short!!

There are literally 100+ espresso makers on Amazon and the greatest number are DeLonghis. For me the more selection I have the more confusing and tedious the decision process is and it took me at least 10 hours to cover the gamut and finally deciding the 2nd machine I had contemplated. And it’s really no surprise because it’s the same machine that I’ve had for 15 years of continuous use that finally stopped functioning. And I won’t lie about it; I abused the heck out of that older machine, cleaning it only a maximum of 4 times when it’s supposed to be cleaned every 200 uses which would have meant I should’ve cleaned it about 500 times. A few times I stuck a thick paperclip up the steam pipe to clear out some clogged dried-up milk that can find its way up there if you fail to run the stream through the wand after you pull the milk carafe away from the wand. But at this price you’re talking about less than $10/year for an excellent cup of Café in any style. This is actually the 3rd DeLonghi I’ve owned in a total of 38 years.One thing you’ll notice that’s telltale about all these machines is the number of “bars”. This model has 15 bars; the bars signify the degree of pressure the machine produces. That’s the same rating as all the Delonghis and for that matter almost all the other off brand models. A couple have 19 bars and many don’t list the bars. Stay away from the latter ones. I’m pretty sure that all these 15 bar machines are using the exact same boiler with as I noted, different chassis and bells and whistles that increase their cost. I consider the gauges that come with some of them superfluous additions and foresee them as components that will malfunction or become inaccurate the future. It’s the bar pressure that is the most determinant factor in the machine’s ability to brew a good cup. Once the green light goes on for “ready” you can proceed to draw the coffee. If you want to wait another 30 seconds or a minute you might get slightly more pressure but I’ve done that and can’t tell any difference in the quality of the brew. The taste difference is in the beans you use and the fineness of their grind. Whether the pressure is 315 or 340 the taste difference is imperceptible. Same goes for the steam pressure buildup for steaming the milk. The green steam light goes on and that means there’s enough steam pressure to heat the milk. That ready light will no doubt go out while you’re in the midst of the final stages of heating the milk, but the pressure is still quite adequate to continue for another half minute or so which would make your milk more than hot enough. But if you want you can let the steam light stay lit green for another 30 seconds for greater pressure before you dip the wand into the milk to heat it. You don’t need a gauge. It’s a very simple machine to operate and makes close to a professional level coffee drink and in many cases, depending on the barista and the machine at the café shop, as good if not better. This is a great little espresso maker.",N/A,Yes

I've had many high end European coffee machines like Gaggia, Saeco etc. This one is a great value for money, with little footprint, fitting into a small space, quiet but powerful. What I specifically like about it is that controls are on the front and easily accessible, water tank is inside the device, and most important, the coffee pan just glides inside with very little training. You can't fail inserting it. As to machine being difficult to start, all machines are that way.  Water needs time to make it from the container through the machine at tge very first time or after storage. The manual is quite specific about ""breaking the machine in"". Also after brewing all coffee machines leak to some extent or at some point, since there is always water inside. Just put a cup for drippings for about 30 minutes and that's it. It develops proper pressure and makes fantastic crema, even from poor stuff like Walmart's coarse grinded decaf. It has no extra settings and that's good. That said, this machine is decent and equally good for an experienced user and a complete novice. Easy, sturdy and fun to try different coffee blends. The only downside for me is that you can't fit a larger cup but coffee pan is a single serving anyway, you can brew longer but it will dilute crema.",One person found this helpful,Yes

We buy coffee beans and grind them ourselves. I usually just let it run for 8-10 seconds- and the shots are good, esp given its price. Shots could sometimes be inconsistent - really based on how you much tamped the coffee and the coffee itself. Like in the picture, I probably could have tamped it a little bit stronger to get a better shot. But overall it’s good.Frothing: the frothing wand is actually good- at first I thought it sucks because I could not get the micro-foam easily. At the end I can get it pretty easily - as many will tell you you need to get used to the wand , take some practice, and you can get the proper foam you want. For me it was exactly the case. The stream coming out is much stronger than the one I have in other house (breville). So In the beginning I could only get very huge bubbles. But I have learned to put the wand a little deeper than I normally do. Now making microfilm is within 10 seconds. Also make sure you read the instruction on how to use the frother.

The space available between the portafilter and the drip tray is 3 3/8 inches (8.6 cm) and from the steam wand to counter is approximately 3 ½ inches (8.9 cm).Useful cord length of the power cord is approximately 49 inches (124.5 cm) terminating in a two prong straight-in plug.  Thank you for having a reasonable cord length.Water tank holds about 34 fluid ounces (1000 ml) and is intended to be removed for filling.  The user can see general indication of tank level through a cut out window in the main body of the machine.Two coffee filters one for a double shot and the other for a single shot (should be illegal).  The coffee filters have keys that must be aligned to fit into the portafilter.  Adjacent to the water tank is a recess to store the spare coffee filter.The portafilter is the tallest that I have even seen (about 2 5/8 inches or 6.7 cm).  Doesn’t make a difference in use or operation but is unusual.  The portafilter is very light and the handle has a very nice feel and grip.The steam wand is located on the right side of the unit and is controlled by what basically is an on-off lever.The boiler must be on the left side as the plastic on the left side does get warm.  The top plate can be used to pre-heat and does get warm or maybe even hot.I couldn’t use my tamper which is 53 mm and therefore too wide so had to use the provided plastic combination scoop and tamper (which is about 50 mm).I also had to practice steaming manually as I have been using a panarello wand.Something that I have been doing is to draw a shot or two before adding coffee and again after dumping the grounds.  Drawing first warms the brew group and I think (or at least hope) that drawing afterwards helps reduce buildup of oils inside the portafilter and coffee filter.,16 people found this helpful,No

   Back in the day, I worked for a family owned Italian Restaurant and they had this big robust espresso machine that I loved.  So many years later and I have fond memories of it.  I then worked for Starbucks in management for a few years.  Again, in and around bigger machines.  I am so happy to have a small espresso machine in my house now.  This was the first time in a decade being around a frother and so there was a learning curve.I tried to video the froth ... I know I could be better at it.  I know it takes hitting just the tip to froth it and slowly you lower your pitcher until half your pitcher is filled with froth.  I have not achieved that perfect froth yet, but I think it is me, and I have not found my technique again.Pours out of both spouts at one time, so you would need a larger glass for it to pour into or it will make a mess.  Didn't realize the first time it didn't stop on its own, so it poured and poured and poured out as it brewed.  Should have read the instructions.Everything else was easy.  It comes with everything you need.  The machine is solid and well made.  None of the parts feel flimsy.  It makes a really good cappuccino.  It takes up very little space.What more can I say?  Good brand.  Good value.  No regrets.  Great little machine.",9 people found this helpful,No

This De’Longhi will pull shots well, and it will steam milk to create cappuccinos and lattes. And it does this all with a compact profile. So if that is what you need and the price looks right, then go for it.We were trying this out as a replacement for our ancient Starbucks branded Sirena Model 398574, and even given it's age, the De’Longhi could not dethrone our Sirena.  Both have a 15 bar pump and the De’Longhi's seems to work well, but after that every point goes against the De’Longhi. First is the build quality of the accessories. The De’Longhi portafilter feels lighter, and the filter baskets are thinner. The tamper that comes with the De’Longhi is plastic.  Next is functionality. You set the De’Longhi pump to either on or off. Unlike other machines there is not preset pull for single or double shot… you need to eyeball it.  Looking at what's included, the De’Longhi did NOT include a milk frothing jug or thermometer.  Also, as is typical of a less expensive machine the De’Longhi does not contain any indicator of pressure or temperature other than a ""ready"" light.Overall it's fine machine if you need it to fit in a tighter space, say in an office. It will be  a basic workhorse, without the bells and whistles.",9 people found this helpful,No

Bought a Stilosa as a temporary solution while the Classic is going through its yearly overhaul.The espresso from the Stilosa is more than acceptable -- it's really quite good. The pressurized portafilter does a great job -- pressurized portafilters have come a long way from 15-20 years ago. With a pressurized portafilter there's no need to tamp the coffee -- just scoop it loose into the portafilter and brew. A proper espresso grind is still helpful for flavor I think -- so put your money into a decent grinder.Another Stilosa feature is critical -- there's an actual steel boiler instead of the thermoblock that low-end espresso machines all had a few years ago. The thermoblocks could never sustain water temperature adequately so you had sour weak coffee. This boiler, while small, provides enough hot water at temperature for about 20 seconds (more than a double shot). And the portafilter is thin, lightweight aluminum so it's not robbing heat from the coffee.The other advantage of a small boiler and lightweight portafilter -- you can turn on this machine and be ready to brew in about 2-3 minutes. By contrast, the Gaggia Classic, with its big brass portafilter, really should have 15-20 minutes to warm up, and the Rancilio, with its huge brass boiler, needs 30-45 minutes.I can't speak to the steam system -- we only use this for coffee shots.But I think the performance is astonishing for the price -- kudos to the engineers at Delonghi. This beats the pants off Nespresso in my opinion and you're not paying 80 cents a shot for pods. It doesn't have the power or flexibility of a Gaggia Classic or Silvia and isn't really designed to crank out 10 drinks for a dinner party. But if all you want is a shot or two in the morning, this will do the job quite well.",One person found this helpful,No

The machine delivers quality shots.The machine is compact and should be able to fit on the countertop in even the smallest of kitchens.That's where the love affair ends for me.  I'd admit it...I like convenience.  Something as simple as not having dedicated buttons to deliver single (who does that?) or double shots is a deal-breaker for me.  While I do like that this machine will dispense any size shot you'd like, I wish this was an OPTION and not the ONLY way to do it.  I tend to multi-task and even though it only takes a minute or two, I prefer to not have to stand next to the machine so that I can manually stop the brew.The milk frother on this machine works about how I would expect it to on an entry-level machine.  However, it also doesn't meet my expectations.  I currently use a freestanding Capresso frother.  While I recognize this is a bit of an extravagance, I've grown accustomed to the thick froth it produces, which can be cut in half and still holds its shape!  The freestanding frother is also much easier to use.  You simply pour your milk into the cup, turn on the machine, and wait for the cycle to end.  The freestanding frother is cleaner to use, as well.  All it requires is a quick rinse after emptying the cup.  With this machine, the frother spatters droplets of milk onto the machine and countertops.  It also requires an oven mitt to remove the nozzle if I want to clean it immediately after use (which I always want to do).  The frother does not come with a cup or jug that conveniently stores on the machine, so you need to get yourself a second cup each time it is used.Most of the parts on this machine are made of plastic.  It appears durable, but obviously won't last as long as a stainless steel machine.Overall, this is a value-priced machine which will deliver a flavorful espresso shot.  However, it is lacking in features which make it convenient or desirable to use on a daily basis.",3 people found this helpful,No

I would have also liked a small jug for frothing milk.I like how compact this machine is. It is only a hair bigger than my Keurig.

Before using the Stilosa, I followed the cleaning instructions.Brewing espresso is easy. Fill the water reservoir as needed. Turn the knob to On to heat the water. Fill the appropriate espresso basket with grounds, tamp the grounds, insert the handle into the machine, put your cup under the spouts, turn the dial to the coffee icon, let brew for about 25 seconds, flip the switch back to On or Off, and your espresso is ready. Inserting the handle into the machine is easy, unlike the Dedica I had, which was so skinny that it would attempt to wobble away.The resulting espresso is good--even using cheap sub-barista medium roast coffee that is ground in a blade grinder. I expect that with more practice and when I use better coffee, I'll get even better espresso.  I use about 1/8th the coffee I used in my Aeropresse, which I filled half way for reasonably strong coffee. Apparently, to get even better espresso, one can cheaply hack these machines with a depressurized basket or handle available online.I dislike loud noise; the Stilosa doesn't seem too noisy.I have only used the Panarello (steam wand) to test the machine and make hot chocolate, which went well. Panarellos seem more trouble than they are worth. A simple $8 battery powered whisk will generally produce better frothed milk than most baristras can make, won't spray foam around the machine, and is easy to clean.The one thing I dislike about Stilosa is the plastic tamper, essentially a blade in waiting between the tamper and measuring spoon. To tamp espresso, you use the tamper to compress the espresso grind with about thirty pounds of pressure.  I would not be surprised if with enough use, the plastic blade-like tamper could break, with a potentially nasty hand injury resulting from the blade-like structure below. I resolved that problem by replacing the plastic tamper with a $6.99 metal tamper. DeLonghi really should include a cheap but safe metal tamper.OMG!  Wait!  Do you need a burr grinder?  Almost every hyper-concerned espresso enthusiast online recommends that one opt for a (bulky) burr grinder to grind beans into good espresso grind. They're correct if one does not fill the blade grinder, but otherwise wrong.  I get a consistent espresso grind comparable to my local barista's grind by filling a decent $20 blade grinder with beans; then I grind using short bursts, tilting the grinder slightly left, right, forward, and back. The grind blends and becomes consistent that way. The excess ground coffee goes into an airtight container for future use, a sacrilege.",N/A,No

The price point should help soothe any beginner anxieties, though; worst case scenario, you live, you learn, and you save money on drive through lattes!As others have noted, the included tamper is plastic, but can (and should) be replaced with a 51mm metal tamper if you're going to use this machine frequently. For home use, you probably don't need a dedicated knock box, but if you plan on saving coffee grounds for homemade scrubs, candles, garden fertilizer, etc., it's a nice investment to make.The steaming wand is unfortunately a bit short, and definitely on the weaker end, likely to accomodate people who plan to steam their milk directly in the cup they're drinking from (lower temperatures for safety). If you really want a strong, dry foam, like for a capuccino, you'll need to buy a separate steaming device, but for your average drip coffee & latte drinker, it will suffice. Normally I'd recommend buying a metal steaming pitcher for your milk, but if you buy another steamer entirely, skip heating your milk, or heat your milk on the stove/in your microwave (horror of horrors! but it's not bad if you don't scald it), you probably won't need one. Like I said, my impression is that the attached steam wand is meant to go directly in your coffee cup, and while that has its pros (less clean-up, fewer items to buy, safer for beginners) & cons (low heat, weak foam), I can respect the trade-off in a safe, entry-level machine.On top of everything else, De'Longhi is a highly respected, high quality brand, so at this price point especially, the Stilosa model espresso machine makes an excellent graduation, birthday, anniversary, or wedding gift.

Getting the coffee grains out of the handle is a pain, most machines have mechanism which allows you to pound the grains out, but this one does not have that and will fall into two pieces if you try it. If I was buying I would pay up for better, but as a gift it is fine to use. The steamer is a 4 out of 10 and I rarely use it. Plastic on the inside, super cheap.",One person found this helpful,No

It measures 8"" wide, 10"" deep, 11.5"" tall, and 15"" tall when the lid is open. That is a nice compact size, especially for where I wanted it to go.It comes with two filters, one for a single shot and a larger one for a double shot. It heats up and is ready to go pretty quickly. The resulting espresso is nice and strong, very satisfying. The milk frother at the side does a nice job and can be rotated back and forth if you want it out of the way.The water tank holds 34 oz and can be removed although you don't have to remove it to refill it. You can easily see when the water level is low through the window and pour water straight into the tank. When you open the lid to the water tank, there is space to the right side where you can store the second filter. The steel baseplate at the bottom of the machine is slotted so errant drips will be collected at the bottom reservoir. This baseplate can also be removed to use cups that are a bit taller (although the reservoir should be cleaned out first). The included tamper is plastic and has a scoop at the other end.My box did not have a manual. It wasn't a problem for me but for someone unfamiliar with espresso machines it might pose a problem.I took off one star because the steel base plate rattles very loudly when the machine is turned on. The vibration makes the cup(s) vibrate and shift around a little.",N/A,No

The original device developed a leak above the espresso head (water would stream out of a crack (?) under pressure).First the good. This coffee machine makes good espresso shots and does a fantastic job of foaming milk. My main coffee maker is a much more expensive (~$800) Breville unit, and this machine does just as good a job of making both espresso shots and if anything is quicker to foam milk. Bravo.Unfortunately, the design of the machine is clunky and they've cut corners (I would cheerfully pay $50 extra for a better designed and constructed version with more sensible controls.)1. The foaming wand is located such that you cannot rest the milk container to the side of the machine (it will be too low) or on the little platform (it will likely overbalance), so you're stuck holding the jug or balancing it precariously while foaming the milk.2. The included scoop is poorly designed and it is physically impossible to put two scoops of coffee into the two cup filter basket (as the instructions suggest). In fact, if you attempt to do this then attempting to attach the espresso head may damage the machine (and may be the cause of the leak I experienced).Also the scoop is made of cheap, bendy plastic, and isn't suitable for applying the correct pressure BUT you don't need to, as the filter basket has a pressure valve on it that ensures the proper pressure (at least while the machine is new). (Some Breville espresso makers come with a ""training wheels"" basket that does the same kind of thing.)3. No jug is included for foaming milk Not a huge deal, and I bought a jug separately.4. The controls are slightly odd. There is a dial with four settings, from left to right: foam, off, on, water, and a big flip lever on the side that controls the steam wand. To make a cappuccino you basically:Fill the 2 cup basket with one heaped scoop of ground coffee. Use the scoop's reverse to tamp the coffee down. (The one cup basket is pretty useless unless you want to produce demitasses or small shots.)Switch to steam mode. Wait for a green light (it's pretty quick). Flip the big lever and steam your milk. Flip it back to turn off the steam. Remove the jug. Flip the lever back on for a second to clean the wand's nozzle.Switch to on. Wait for a green light (again, pretty quick). Switch from ON to WATER and pour out the shot.Then pour the shot and milk into a cup and you're done.That's about it. For the price, it produces very good coffee. I hope it lasts longer this time (and if it does I may come back and bump up my rating).",N/A,Yes

A 3 in 1 I purchased last year conked on me after 3 months (well the frother did and then the espresso machine part altogether this means the pump went grrrr...that one was way more expensive than this) Anyway, my old Delonghi and this one, although loud and a bit clunky, have been great (so far). My machine with Delonghi before was amazing and lasted over 5 years! I loved it and so far I love this one too!Helpful tipsFor those showing problems, all espresso machines will drip and if you overload grounds the thing won't be able to hold them and you will destroy your machine.Be sure to use fine ground espresso and not regular coffee, you won't get the same beautiful espresso from regular coffee. I grind SB Fench or Espresso roast on 12 on my grinder (very fine).Some of the other machines have a shorter wand for the milk frother but this is just right. If you don't know how to pull milk then look at YouTube there are several how too's there. Also note that before steaming the milk you will likely have to release some water from the wand or your milk will come out flat (that happened the first time I used it, and then I remembered I had to do this with my old machine). Simply put an empty cup, you will not use for milk, under the wand and open the steamer. You'll likely get about 2 tbsps of water. Close it back up, wait for green light and steam. Do not forget to clear the steamer wand before and after foaming your milk.As for the very stiff coffee holder. It's supposed to be hard to twist and as long as you don't overfill the coffee it will be fine! Be sure to tamp the coffee as well...thats what the flat part of the scooper is for.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

BUT, I glued Sorbotane feet on it with Loctite Instant Adhesive 401 which the company which makes Sorbothane suggests. I believe it dropped around 10dB and is much more stable now.Coffee used so far (in order of my 3 top beans):1. Illy (Recommended by a friend from Rome who visited over the holidays)2. Black Riffle Coffee - Gunship3. Lavazza Super Crema Medium expressoOf course all of them tasted so much better than my cheap Krups steam powered expresso machine. And there was only a slight difference between each one. So of course I had to try it many times with all of them to ensure I wasn't imagining things.

   Worst espresso machine I've ever purchased. Would not recommend to anyone!!! I'm very disappointed because I spent HOURS researching to figure out what was the best one and based on reviews I thought I made an informed decision.  However, this is the second machine that we've gone through in less than 2 months as it was a replacement that Amazon sent us. I made sure to clean both machines before using. I've had espresso machines in the past. It takes over 10 minutes to pull a shot and barely manages to do that. Save your money!!",46 people found this helpful,Yes

Busqué solucionarlo con las instrucciones, pero la respuesta llegó en un foro, donde explican que el café puede no salir por dos situaciones:1.- El molido del café es muy fino, por lo que al aplastarlo en el cartucho el agua no logra salir.2.- Está muy aplastado el café en el cartucho por lo que el agua no logra salir.En ambos casos es un asunto de la presión de la maquina como tal y la unica forma de solucionarlo es comprar un café no tan fino y no aplanarlo tanto en el cartucho, de modo que sale a una velocidad correcta.Espero que este review ayude a nuevos usuarios, porque la maquina en sí funciona bien, sólo es cuestión de saber usarla.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

Quinn,N/A,2.0 out of 5 stars,Canada,"January 16, 2022",N/A,"Like:  Cheap  Compact  Espresso taste is acceptable  Can disassemble the filter pods to clean the filter screen. Easy to clear any clogs (unless the pod is jammed in the holder, see below)Dislike:  Water level viewing window too hard too see as it is shadowed by the upper part of the machine. I need to open the top and look into the reservoir to check the level.  Steaming wand control lever is awkwardly placed for a right-hander. You have to hold the milk vessel in your right hand and operate the lever with your left, while reaching clumsily over the top or around the front of the machine.  Steaming function instructions have to be followed exactly or you wind up with steam and water all over the countertop. (I learned eventually, but It's not intuitive enough for my liking.)  The two coffee pods are interchangeable, BUT after less than a month of use, the action of locking the holder in place to make the coffee causes the pod to rotate in the holder, and it can't be easily removed. I had to use a pair of pliers to remove it. Maybe related to the spring that is supposed to hold the pod in place - after a month the spring no longer holds it secure. This nullifies the benefit of having the pod easy to disassemble for cleaning.  Not sure if this a design flaw or poor manufacture.  The clearance between the drip tray and the pod is not enough for me to use my favourite cup. I have to take the drip tray cover off for it to fit.  To lock the pod holder in place It's necesssary to hold the machine down firmly or else the whole machine just turns. When the top gets hot, it is very uncomfortable. There's no obvious handhold to use for the purpose.Edit added March 18/2022: It's not often that I use the double pod to dispense two cups  at once, but when I do, the fill is very uneven between the two spouts. The left one dispenses maybe 3/4 of the amount that the right one does. So for the purposes of pulling two shots at once, the machine is useless. I have tried switching around each component of the pod between the double and single, tried levelling the machine, cleaning it, all to no avail.If I had known all this I would not have bought this product.",3 people found this helpful,Yes
