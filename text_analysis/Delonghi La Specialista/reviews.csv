The price and features are very similar.  However, the Breville has more settings than the De'Longhi (For example, the Breville has 18 grind settings while the De'Longhi only has 8).  Also, the De'Longhi only comes with pressurized portafilter baskets while the Breville comes with both pressurized and non-pressurized ones.  Why does that matter?  With a pressurized portafilter basket, it's easier to make espresso that tastes the way you expect even if your grind size or extraction times are not perfect.  With a non-pressurized basket, the grind size and extraction time need to be almost perfect in order for the espresso shot to taste good.  But it takes a lot of time and practice to achieve the ""perfect shot"".  If you are a beginner and want to make espresso that tastes good without too much effort, the De'Longhi is probably the better machine for you.  But if you are willing to spend the time to improve your skills and you want a machine that has more adjustments and options, then I would go with the Breville.  But you can make great-tasting espresso with either machine.",38 people found this helpful,No

When I got this machine and tasted the first espresso it made, using the exact same beans I had been using with the ROK, it was like night and day. The flavor was far more complex, long lasting, and magical. It was like going from grape juice to $100 wine - I'm not exaggerating. I have since started making Latte's and have surprised myself with the amount of perfect froth I can make - it reminds of when I worked at a giant tech company's office and used their $3500 machine. I'm already doing artwork with it, it's so perfect. So I could not be happier with this machine - also it's so compact that it fits on top of my small freezer. This allows me to have the milk wand hang over the edge of the freezer. Some people have commented that the wand is placed such that it is difficult to pull the pitcher away - but this solves that - not sure it's really a problem either as I haven't tried it on a countertop. I am not an espresso expert, but I have been following the guidelines for grinding and dosing, and have gotten excellent results with both dark (Illy) and medium (Lavazza) roast beans so far.",4 people found this helpful,Yes

I bought this espresso machine to replace my $20 percolator that finally stopped working after over 5 years of daily use.  I read the product manual to learn how to draw espresso shots.  The espresso had a strong flavor, and the steam wand made nice frothy milk, but the drinks did not seem very caffeinated, even after I played with the settings, and I found I had to drink 5 double shots of espresso to come close to the caffeine of my 2 mugs of coffee.  This turned into a considerable time investment, as it is much more work to draw espresso shots then it is to brew a cup of percolated coffee.  But the lattes tasted really good, so I persevered.  After just a day under 3 weeks of daily use, the grinder stopped working.  I read up and determined that this was most likely due to a clog.  I watched a video in which someone easily removed the bean container to clean out the grinder, but my bean container was stuck, and I was unable to remove it, and neither were 2 other people who tried to help me with it, and it seemed like applying any more force would cause more damage.

   De'Longhi La Specialista Maestro Machine ($1,299.95) and Arte Machine ($699.95). I have been spoiled with the Maestro, however it does take up a lot of space.Some features I liked about the Arte1. Requires less space2. Has an on/off switch on the side of the unit3. Easy and quick to set up and start brewing4. Comes with all the accessories needed5. Costs $600 less than the MaestroSome features that I did’t like about the Arte1. The bean container is fixed on the unit, so if you want to change out coffee beans it’s a bit harder than the Maestro which has a removable bean container.2. You have to push in the sump to start the grind, it’s automatic on the Maestro when you lock the sump in place.3. There’s not much clearance on the steam wand, almost spilled froth since you have to remove it an angle, while on the Maestro it sits higher on the unit.4. Extra parts, like tapper, mat and holder are separate, not stored on the unit. I do love the automatic built in tapper on the Maestro.The Arte Machine is very comparable with the Breville Bartista Express which is $100 less than the De’Longhi and has a place for the tapper on the machine.It really comes down to features, space and budget. Both are great machine, as they are easy to use. Of course I really like the Maestro but the Arte is a good entry level machine.",16 people found this helpful,No

The top model, is twice as much as this one, so it's not really worth considering if you are already thinking of getting an espresso machine in this price range. The mid-tier machine is the Specialisita Prestigio which is only $100 more. That extra $100 might be worth spending for some folks, or not worth it at all for others.MAJOR DIFFERENCES-Height/size-Manual tamping vs. automatic tamping (this machine is manual)-Small cup stand vs. flip down tray-Steam wand control mechanism (this machine has an on/off button, the Prestigio has a turn knob on the side)-Heating system is shared in the Arte and separate in the Prestigio, meaning the mechanism to heat and extract espresso is not the same as that which steams milk (supposedly shorter time between extraction and frothing)WHY YOU MIGHT WANT THIS MACHINE (La Specialista Arte)This machine is much smaller than the Prestigio. It can fit under standard height mounted cabinets fairly well.Manual tamping gives you more control and would likely be a better option if you plan to use different beans often because fine-tuning your grind and dose with automatic tamping is a big pain.A little more left-handed friendly since there is no knob for the frothing wand. Also I expect would be a bit easier to use one handed or with limited mobility. It's still a tight fit to get the portafilter into the spot to extract the espresso but on the Prestigio you have to do that twice (first to grind then to extract). The Arte using a button for the frother is also easier. However the power button is on the left side toward the back which might be worse if you are using your right-hand only.WHY YOU MIGHT WANT THE PRESTIGIO INSTEADUpgrading one step up by $100 gives you automatic tamping which is less messy. If you plan to stick to one type of bean or not planning on switching too often then this is a good option. If you have someone in the home that is less espresso savvy that extra feature makes it a little more accessible to them and would make them more inclined to make their own drinks.Drop down holder for espresso cups is nice, one less piece of equipment to lose or keep track of.Better bean hopper which is also removeable making it easier to clean the grinder.So yeah, which one is right for you will probably depend primarily on the size which is the biggest factor for me. Also, how important is manual vs. automatic tamping. And finally, the $100 price difference.",10 people found this helpful,No

But it takes a lot of time and practice to achieve the ""perfect shot"".  If you are a beginner and want to make espresso that tastes good without too much effort, the De'Longhi is probably the better machine for you.  But if you are willing to spend the time to improve your skills and you want a machine that has more adjustments and options, then I would go with the Breville.  But you can make great-tasting espresso with either machine.",38 people found this helpful,No

When I got this machine and tasted the first espresso it made, using the exact same beans I had been using with the ROK, it was like night and day. The flavor was far more complex, long lasting, and magical. It was like going from grape juice to $100 wine - I'm not exaggerating. I have since started making Latte's and have surprised myself with the amount of perfect froth I can make - it reminds of when I worked at a giant tech company's office and used their $3500 machine. I'm already doing artwork with it, it's so perfect. So I could not be happier with this machine - also it's so compact that it fits on top of my small freezer. This allows me to have the milk wand hang over the edge of the freezer. Some people have commented that the wand is placed such that it is difficult to pull the pitcher away - but this solves that - not sure it's really a problem either as I haven't tried it on a countertop. I am not an espresso expert, but I have been following the guidelines for grinding and dosing, and have gotten excellent results with both dark (Illy) and medium (Lavazza) roast beans so far.",4 people found this helpful,Yes

I bought this espresso machine to replace my $20 percolator that finally stopped working after over 5 years of daily use.  I read the product manual to learn how to draw espresso shots.  The espresso had a strong flavor, and the steam wand made nice frothy milk, but the drinks did not seem very caffeinated, even after I played with the settings, and I found I had to drink 5 double shots of espresso to come close to the caffeine of my 2 mugs of coffee.  This turned into a considerable time investment, as it is much more work to draw espresso shots then it is to brew a cup of percolated coffee.  But the lattes tasted really good, so I persevered.  After just a day under 3 weeks of daily use, the grinder stopped working.  I read up and determined that this was most likely due to a clog.  I watched a video in which someone easily removed the bean container to clean out the grinder, but my bean container was stuck, and I was unable to remove it, and neither were 2 other people who tried to help me with it, and it seemed like applying any more force would cause more damage.

It’s a near-pro machine that is still capable of fitting on your counter and weighs less than twenty pounds even as it allows you to make coffee house-quality coffee creations.Move up a bit in price from DeLonghi and you can get built-in tamping, a feature that enables the novice to get things right without a lot of trial-and-error and wasted coffee. This machine lacks the auto-tamping, but it does come with a set of tools and a thick rubbery tamping pad that helps with the process.Conical burr grinding starts your mixture off right. You must choose between eight grind settings—and fresh ground is always better than pod coffee.Three water temperatures are available in addition to the eight grind settings. Getting grind, temperature and tamping right require practice and familiarity with the espresso beans and style you are going for, but it also makes this a more satisfying machine to use when you’ve got it down than the three-times-the-cost fully-automatic machines. Getting the frothed milk for your latte right via the frothing wand is a further skill to be acquired, one I’ve not fully mastered.This is a beautiful machine, well worth a spot on your counter if you love espresso.

It's genuinely steamed, not just frothed. I used to have espresso machines that would break after a while and we switched to Nespresso for a long time. That was good but, honestly, I think I forgot how fantastic excellent espresso and steamed milk really is.And, when I talk about real espresso, I'm not talking about Starbucks-- this surpasses anything you get at a chain.

Costs $600 less than the MaestroSome features that I did’t like about the Arte1. The bean container is fixed on the unit, so if you want to change out coffee beans it’s a bit harder than the Maestro which has a removable bean container.2. You have to push in the sump to start the grind, it’s automatic on the Maestro when you lock the sump in place.3. There’s not much clearance on the steam wand, almost spilled froth since you have to remove it an angle, while on the Maestro it sits higher on the unit.4. Extra parts, like tapper, mat and holder are separate, not stored on the unit. I do love the automatic built in tapper on the Maestro.The Arte Machine is very comparable with the Breville Bartista Express which is $100 less than the De’Longhi and has a place for the tapper on the machine.It really comes down to features, space and budget. Both are great machine, as they are easy to use. Of course I really like the Maestro but the Arte is a good entry level machine.",16 people found this helpful,No

The top model, is twice as much as this one, so it's not really worth considering if you are already thinking of getting an espresso machine in this price range. The mid-tier machine is the Specialisita Prestigio which is only $100 more. That extra $100 might be worth spending for some folks, or not worth it at all for others.MAJOR DIFFERENCES-Height/size-Manual tamping vs. automatic tamping (this machine is manual)-Small cup stand vs. flip down tray-Steam wand control mechanism (this machine has an on/off button, the Prestigio has a turn knob on the side)-Heating system is shared in the Arte and separate in the Prestigio, meaning the mechanism to heat and extract espresso is not the same as that which steams milk (supposedly shorter time between extraction and frothing)WHY YOU MIGHT WANT THIS MACHINE (La Specialista Arte)This machine is much smaller than the Prestigio. It can fit under standard height mounted cabinets fairly well.Manual tamping gives you more control and would likely be a better option if you plan to use different beans often because fine-tuning your grind and dose with automatic tamping is a big pain.A little more left-handed friendly since there is no knob for the frothing wand. Also I expect would be a bit easier to use one handed or with limited mobility. It's still a tight fit to get the portafilter into the spot to extract the espresso but on the Prestigio you have to do that twice (first to grind then to extract). The Arte using a button for the frother is also easier. However the power button is on the left side toward the back which might be worse if you are using your right-hand only.WHY YOU MIGHT WANT THE PRESTIGIO INSTEADUpgrading one step up by $100 gives you automatic tamping which is less messy. If you plan to stick to one type of bean or not planning on switching too often then this is a good option. If you have someone in the home that is less espresso savvy that extra feature makes it a little more accessible to them and would make them more inclined to make their own drinks.Drop down holder for espresso cups is nice, one less piece of equipment to lose or keep track of.Better bean hopper which is also removeable making it easier to clean the grinder.So yeah, which one is right for you will probably depend primarily on the size which is the biggest factor for me. Also, how important is manual vs. automatic tamping. And finally, the $100 price difference.",10 people found this helpful,No

It’s a near-pro machine that is still capable of fitting on your counter and weighs less than twenty pounds even as it allows you to make coffee house-quality coffee creations.Move up a bit in price from DeLonghi and you can get built-in tamping, a feature that enables the novice to get things right without a lot of trial-and-error and wasted coffee. This machine lacks the auto-tamping, but it does come with a set of tools and a thick rubbery tamping pad that helps with the process.Conical burr grinding starts your mixture off right. You must choose between eight grind settings—and fresh ground is always better than pod coffee.Three water temperatures are available in addition to the eight grind settings. Getting grind, temperature and tamping right require practice and familiarity with the espresso beans and style you are going for, but it also makes this a more satisfying machine to use when you’ve got it down than the three-times-the-cost fully-automatic machines. Getting the frothed milk for your latte right via the frothing wand is a further skill to be acquired, one I’ve not fully mastered.This is a beautiful machine, well worth a spot on your counter if you love espresso. You will likely need to use it every time espresso is made. It’s a machine that requires skill and experience and you can’t just turn it over to your guests.

It's genuinely steamed, not just frothed. I used to have espresso machines that would break after a while and we switched to Nespresso for a long time. That was good but, honestly, I think I forgot how fantastic excellent espresso and steamed milk really is.And, when I talk about real espresso, I'm not talking about Starbucks-- this surpasses anything you get at a chain.

I would be happy if the angle of the steam wand had greater flexibility, but even in our small space, we can make it work.  The integrated grinder and smart tamping station are great; this feature really makes the process of making espresso in the morning smooth.  I really appreciate how much grinding chaos is reduced by the grinding machine/compacting station compared to traditional machines. In traditional machines, grinding and compacting are a separate step.  Although it does take a few attempts to set the grinding and grinding amount correctly, the process is not difficult.

It has a relatively small footprint for a machine that has a built in grinder. I am actually a die-hard French presser as I love the complex taste and texture of the infusion that gets the most out of the natural oils in the bean. I also have a De'Longhi Nespresso Vertuo machine for a quick convenient brew in a hurry. However, the pods get expensive and the variety of coffee available is limited.GRINDER: There are indeed more compact machines than the Arte, however, they do not a have a built in grinder. This one is an 8-level conical burr, stainless, not ceramic. This may matter to you as it does to me -- I do have a preference for slow-grinding ceramic burr as it is more durable and there is less transfer of heat that changes the flavor of the grind. Most will say its not a significant difference. I think for an espresso, it's not a big deal either, but for a more nuanced French press, ceramic burr at slow speed is the way to go. I do like that this is not a blade grinder which can be inconsistent. Beans must be weighed or measured to exactly what you need in your portafilter -- it will not automatically output the correct amount, but will stop when all the beans you have put in have been ground. 14 grams is about perfect for my 2-shot brew.PORTAFILTER, TAMPING & PRESSURE: The portafilter for this machine is 51mm. Standard commercial machines are 58mm in diameter. The Arte comes with a manual tamping 'station' which is essentially a rubber mat that has a dual base base that perfectly fits your portafilter and tamper. The upgrade Prestigio machine is about $150 more in cost at the time of writing but has a built in smart tamper that applies the correct pressure to pack your grind. Note that the Arte has a double wall portafilter basket where the inside has fine mesh holes, and the outside has larger holes. This allows for pressure to be regulated better with varied manual tamping, giving better consistency to your brew at 15 bars. I believe the Prestigio has a single wall basket. I love that this has a collared tamping guide that locks over the portafilter which minimizes mess when the grind is delivered, and makes for easy tamping and grind distribution inside the collar. It's really easy to lock on and remove.CUSTOMIZATION: The brew is easily programmable. You can customize your volume, strength, and pre-infusion, and internal brewing temperature. There is a guide inside the manual with recommendations for different roast levels. I did some experimentation and it really does make a difference even with an incremental change. If the flavor output is not to your liking, persist and keep playing with the settings that will optimize the flavor of your specific bean. There are preprogrammed outputs for espresso, long black (regular, aka Americano), and plain hot water.STEAMING WAND: The milk steaming wand creates beautiful, velvety micro foam and is perfect for latte art. The texture is much better than superficial foam created with even my Nespresso Aeroccino. I do wish that the wand would articulate to a higher angle as the clearance from the countertop is limited but adequate. I do like that it folds completely backward and out of the way when not in use, and it also moves forward directly over the drip tray so you can purge the wand without making a mess all over your counter or needing to do it into a cup or cloth.DESIGN:  It's a beauty in stainless and black, built solidly of good quality materials.SIZE: Compact for all the features it has. It will accommodate a cup up to 4.5"" tall on the main drip tray. There is also a separate smaller drip tray to bring up the height for little espresso cups. The water tank on the back has a large capacity and flips open at the top so you can fill without removing. It will eliminate the need for a separate milk steamer/frother, and grinder. Total footprint and space is 14.37"" x 15.87"" x 11.22"". It even fits underneath my overhead cabinets.PERFORMANCE: Overall, this is a great machine that even my son says outputs a good quality brew with good efficiency and decent ergonomics for a compact unit -- he works at a coffee stand and uses commercial grade machines all day long. This actually makes my Nespresso machine obsolete for me as this outputs much better espresso with more options for types of coffee and is easy to use, quick, and convenient at a lower cost per cup. However I will not get rid of my rudimentary French press, not my ceramic slow burr grinder as they offer a different flavor profile. It's like the difference between flame-grilling, or slow cooking a beef roast.OTHER: Although there seems to be a ridged 'tray' of sorts on the top surface, this does not function as a cup warmer like some other espresso machines have. There is no cup warmer with this machine.For an all-in-one space saving espresso machine, the Arte from the Specialista line is an excellent option. I love having this in my kitchen.

   DeLonghi has a long-standing reputation for well-made coffee machines. Their machines are made with the user in mind, which produce a unique cup of espresso at a push of a button while admiring the elegant, compact design that is the signature style of the DeLonghi brand.I truly think La Specialista is a successful machine that produces bonafide espresso and outstanding milk froth. BUT, you have A LOT to learn about this complicated machine. On a sliding scale, the Delonghi La Specialista is not a automatic espresso coffee machine.If you’re looking for a coffee aespresso machine that doesn’t require much work, this is not your machine.If you considered yourself as a real coffeeness, you truly are investing in an all-around coffee experience that doesn’t stop at a shot of espresso when purchasing one of their creations. I’ve been using it over a month, it did take a while to sort out the right settings to make a good long black for me. After a few mistakes over a small number of days it is now pretty well sorted. I've had a blast making espressos, lattes, iced lattes, and coffee with this machine.The all stainless steel build quality with it's glossy black front panel is sleek, contemporary, and classy. The modern knobs and a traditional pressure gauge as the centerpiece, the Delonghi La Specialista is quite the looker. The left is dedicated to grinding beans, compacting and dosing, while the right is where you’ll find the brew head, automatic milk wand and hot water outlet. The updated grinder from the older La Specialista is a great improvement. You can dial in the grind with much better precession.I do enjoy making coffee from freshly ground beans rather than having to buy coffee pots for my old machine. The other thing to note is both new models use non-pressurised baskets, compared to the old model had pressurised. Non-pressurised is so much better.The water tank is a very generous 84.5 fluid ounces. Although it’s located at the back of the machine, lifting it out from the top is easy. I also give DeLonghi hybrid a perfect 10 for its milk froth. The automatic steam wand puts in a faultless performance. It does everything right.Cleaning is also an easy shot. Some components are dishwasher safe and wipe clean machine with a damp cloth.If you've never owned a manual coffee machine before, I recommend you get on YouTube and look up some how to videos.",N/A,No

It was packaged very carefully and no parts were damaged. The instruction manual lists roast settings so I knew exactly what grind and temperature to use for my beans to brew my perfect cup. It has 8 grind settings, several heat settings and allows me to choose my shot size and drink type. It does require manual tamping, which is really no big deal to me. It pulls a consistent cup every time and brings out the beautiful flavor of my beans. My only complaints are that 1) the bean grinder is not removable, so changing out beans proves to be a bit difficult and 2) the frother wand is positioned quite low and I have difficulty removing the milk cup without having to tip it spilling out some of the liquid. But I rarely change out the beans and don’t froth milk that much, so these two things aren’t a big issue to me all though worth noting.

Your coffee grind dosage level can be done according to the type of brewing you want  Adjust from light roast, medium roast, medium deep roast and deep roast.My main purpose of this machine is to make lattes and cappuccinos.  The steam wand is powerful enough to quickly produce thick velvet milk that will not get too wet.  This is great for coffee drinks and children's drinks, so we can easily make steamers for children.  I would be happy if the angle of the steam wand had greater flexibility, but even in our small space, we can make it work.  The integrated grinder and smart tamping station are great; this feature really makes the process of making espresso in the morning smooth.  I really appreciate how much grinding chaos is reduced by the grinding machine/compacting station compared to traditional machines. In traditional machines, grinding and compacting are a separate step.  Although it does take a few attempts to set the grinding and grinding amount correctly, the process is not difficult.  It is well documented in the manual, and once you figure it out, it's easy to switch between different coffees.

It has a relatively small footprint for a machine that has a built in grinder. I am actually a die-hard French presser as I love the complex taste and texture of the infusion that gets the most out of the natural oils in the bean. I also have a De'Longhi Nespresso Vertuo machine for a quick convenient brew in a hurry. However, the pods get expensive and the variety of coffee available is limited.GRINDER: There are indeed more compact machines than the Arte, however, they do not a have a built in grinder. This one is an 8-level conical burr, stainless, not ceramic. This may matter to you as it does to me -- I do have a preference for slow-grinding ceramic burr as it is more durable and there is less transfer of heat that changes the flavor of the grind. Most will say its not a significant difference. I think for an espresso, it's not a big deal either, but for a more nuanced French press, ceramic burr at slow speed is the way to go. I do like that this is not a blade grinder which can be inconsistent. Beans must be weighed or measured to exactly what you need in your portafilter -- it will not automatically output the correct amount, but will stop when all the beans you have put in have been ground. 14 grams is about perfect for my 2-shot brew.PORTAFILTER, TAMPING & PRESSURE: The portafilter for this machine is 51mm. Standard commercial machines are 58mm in diameter. The Arte comes with a manual tamping 'station' which is essentially a rubber mat that has a dual base base that perfectly fits your portafilter and tamper. The upgrade Prestigio machine is about $150 more in cost at the time of writing but has a built in smart tamper that applies the correct pressure to pack your grind. Note that the Arte has a double wall portafilter basket where the inside has fine mesh holes, and the outside has larger holes. This allows for pressure to be regulated better with varied manual tamping, giving better consistency to your brew at 15 bars. I believe the Prestigio has a single wall basket. I love that this has a collared tamping guide that locks over the portafilter which minimizes mess when the grind is delivered, and makes for easy tamping and grind distribution inside the collar. It's really easy to lock on and remove.CUSTOMIZATION: The brew is easily programmable. You can customize your volume, strength, and pre-infusion, and internal brewing temperature. There is a guide inside the manual with recommendations for different roast levels. I did some experimentation and it really does make a difference even with an incremental change. If the flavor output is not to your liking, persist and keep playing with the settings that will optimize the flavor of your specific bean. There are preprogrammed outputs for espresso, long black (regular, aka Americano), and plain hot water.STEAMING WAND: The milk steaming wand creates beautiful, velvety micro foam and is perfect for latte art. The texture is much better than superficial foam created with even my Nespresso Aeroccino. I do wish that the wand would articulate to a higher angle as the clearance from the countertop is limited but adequate. I do like that it folds completely backward and out of the way when not in use, and it also moves forward directly over the drip tray so you can purge the wand without making a mess all over your counter or needing to do it into a cup or cloth.DESIGN:  It's a beauty in stainless and black, built solidly of good quality materials.SIZE: Compact for all the features it has. It will accommodate a cup up to 4.5"" tall on the main drip tray. There is also a separate smaller drip tray to bring up the height for little espresso cups. The water tank on the back has a large capacity and flips open at the top so you can fill without removing. It will eliminate the need for a separate milk steamer/frother, and grinder. Total footprint and space is 14.37"" x 15.87"" x 11.22"". It even fits underneath my overhead cabinets.PERFORMANCE: Overall, this is a great machine that even my son says outputs a good quality brew with good efficiency and decent ergonomics for a compact unit -- he works at a coffee stand and uses commercial grade machines all day long. This actually makes my Nespresso machine obsolete for me as this outputs much better espresso with more options for types of coffee and is easy to use, quick, and convenient at a lower cost per cup. However I will not get rid of my rudimentary French press, not my ceramic slow burr grinder as they offer a different flavor profile. It's like the difference between flame-grilling, or slow cooking a beef roast.OTHER: Although there seems to be a ridged 'tray' of sorts on the top surface, this does not function as a cup warmer like some other espresso machines have. There is no cup warmer with this machine.For an all-in-one space saving espresso machine, the Arte from the Specialista line is an excellent option. I love having this in my kitchen.

   DeLonghi has a long-standing reputation for well-made coffee machines. Their machines are made with the user in mind, which produce a unique cup of espresso at a push of a button while admiring the elegant, compact design that is the signature style of the DeLonghi brand.I truly think La Specialista is a successful machine that produces bonafide espresso and outstanding milk froth. BUT, you have A LOT to learn about this complicated machine. On a sliding scale, the Delonghi La Specialista is not a automatic espresso coffee machine.If you’re looking for a coffee aespresso machine that doesn’t require much work, this is not your machine.If you considered yourself as a real coffeeness, you truly are investing in an all-around coffee experience that doesn’t stop at a shot of espresso when purchasing one of their creations. I’ve been using it over a month, it did take a while to sort out the right settings to make a good long black for me. After a few mistakes over a small number of days it is now pretty well sorted. I've had a blast making espressos, lattes, iced lattes, and coffee with this machine.The all stainless steel build quality with it's glossy black front panel is sleek, contemporary, and classy. The modern knobs and a traditional pressure gauge as the centerpiece, the Delonghi La Specialista is quite the looker. The left is dedicated to grinding beans, compacting and dosing, while the right is where you’ll find the brew head, automatic milk wand and hot water outlet. The updated grinder from the older La Specialista is a great improvement. You can dial in the grind with much better precession.I do enjoy making coffee from freshly ground beans rather than having to buy coffee pots for my old machine. The other thing to note is both new models use non-pressurised baskets, compared to the old model had pressurised. Non-pressurised is so much better.The water tank is a very generous 84.5 fluid ounces. Although it’s located at the back of the machine, lifting it out from the top is easy. I also give DeLonghi hybrid a perfect 10 for its milk froth. The automatic steam wand puts in a faultless performance. It does everything right.Cleaning is also an easy shot. Some components are dishwasher safe and wipe clean machine with a damp cloth.If you've never owned a manual coffee machine before, I recommend you get on YouTube and look up some how to videos.",N/A,No

It was packaged very carefully and no parts were damaged. The instruction manual lists roast settings so I knew exactly what grind and temperature to use for my beans to brew my perfect cup. It has 8 grind settings, several heat settings and allows me to choose my shot size and drink type. It does require manual tamping, which is really no big deal to me. It pulls a consistent cup every time and brings out the beautiful flavor of my beans. My only complaints are that 1) the bean grinder is not removable, so changing out beans proves to be a bit difficult and 2) the frother wand is positioned quite low and I have difficulty removing the milk cup without having to tip it spilling out some of the liquid. But I rarely change out the beans and don’t froth milk that much, so these two things aren’t a big issue to me all though worth noting.

First, setup was easy enough with the instructions manual included. The manual has a ""roast chart"" with guidelines to show you which settings are optimal. I really like that this espresso machine includes a tamping guide so you don't waste any precious coffee grinds. This model has 3 options: Espresso, Americano or Hot Water. I've used the hot water tap several times for making tea, it's so quick and easy. This machine brews delicious espresso. My caramel macchiatos taste better than those overpriced versions I normally go out to get. The machine has been easy to clean. The bottom tray pops in and out easily. I love making latte art and the steam wand is able to create nice milk foam.

This Arte model is one of the cheaper ones from the La Specialista line. Comparing this machine to other more expensive brands, you will of course find more plastic parts and fewer options.Pros: 1. For a manual expresso machine, this was easy to use. I just followed the included instructions for the initial cleaning then to make the first cup of coffee. 2. The taste of the coffee is the most important of course. I didn't have any espresso specific beans for my first test so I just used my regular beans from Costco. Wow! The first americano out of this machine tasted so much better than from my drip coffee maker. 3. This machine looks good and fits under my cabinets. 4. The grinder has 8 levels and works great. 5. The steam wand is not pannarello so you will have to hold the cup just so to get the foam to your liking. Many old school baristas prefers this. For me, I am more of a latte person, so for me, this wand works great. 6. Detachable and dishwasher safe parts means the clean up is easier.Cons: 1. De'Longhi should have include the automatic tamper in this model (like in their La Specialista models) 2. They should have also included unpressurized baskets as well. 3. You see the nice looking cups in the listing? Na, none are included. 4. The water tanks is in the back of the machine which means refilling is inconvenient.In conclusion, this is a good manual espresso machine for beginners. It has all the basics and is forgiving so you will get a good cup of coffee without having perfect skills.",5 people found this helpful,Yes

The main difference isn't in the core performance, but rather in materials I find.  This model uses more plastics than our older machine and up close inspection isn't as impressive as more expensive models but from a few feet away it's not super obvious that it's a more budget option and honestly I've seen machines that cost four times as much still use plastics in places I thought there shouldn't be any, only that they were coated in a stainless-look paint so even if you spend a LOT more you still can't get away from the plastics these days.  You also give up things like digital displays and controls but at the end of the day, these are things that you stop thinking about a week after using a machine.  If this were a superautomatic and everything else remained the same about heating performance (which is great) and construction it would probably be a machine with twice the sticker price.The operation despite having ""basic"" controls is intuitive and it's still very much an easy to use machine that I find hard to make a bad drink from.  I have no real complaints about usability but a couple of situational niggles that apply to my kitchen that may not apply to yours.  The main one is that the machine is quite chunky both width and height wise for a manual unit, it takes a bit more horizontal room than other options.  Our upper cabinets are slightly lower over the counter than standard due to the upper cabinets being a bit taller than average and the raised hopper on this is something that is more difficult to fill without pulling the machine out from under the cabinets every time.  Overall though, it's still not the biggest manual out there and most people should have no problem housing it in the kitchen I think.The grinder works really well, actually, I think it works better than a $2000+ superautomatic I've used in the past.  The hopper doesn't seem as prone to getting beans stuck in it but I have been buying beans that I specifically choose for low oil for years now to avoid problems with automatic grinders.  The straight forward hopper design does seem to help though as our previous machine has a lot off weird crevices in the hopper area that force me to get in there and spread them around frequently.  The number of grind settings I think is more than adequate to get the drink you want though it is less than some other options, I suggest starting with setting 5 and adjusting from there.  I don't often use milk and have never been very good at using steam wands but the one on this model seems to work well, give you good control and produces steam very quickly turning on and off quickly without much delay and with more than enough quantity to make short work of it - I didn't feel like it got out of control on me.",One person found this helpful,No

As with all hybrids, the machine is divided into two workstations. The left is dedicated to grinding beans, compacting, and dosing, while the right is where you’ll find the brew head, automatic milk wand, and hot water outlet. I am, by no means, a professional espresso maker, but I do enjoy a good espresso martini and I do love my Starbucks. The machine comes with easy to read and follow instructions that will help even the inexperienced barista produce a well brewed beverage. This machine is more than perfect for the novice espresso maker. I love that it comes with a milk frother, as my favourite thing to drink is a latte. The machine itself is beautiful and something that I absolutely LOVE having on my counter top permanently. I have tried a variety of different roasts, brands, and coffee beans, and have yet to be disappointed in the espresso and coffee drinks that come out of the machine. An added bonus to the machine is that I often enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon or evenings, and I no longer need to use a kettle of any kind, as this machine dispenses hot water for tea with the push of a button. No, it is not as fast as an automatic machine, and it has a slight learning curve, but once you start using it and drinking the coffee, you will understand the value in taking a few extra minutes. I HIGHLY recommend watching product videos on making espresso and frothing milk in order to perfect the art.  I highly recommend this to anyone who drinks specialty coffee and likes having a great consistent cup every time. Love it a latte!",One person found this helpful,No

It's easy to use and there is a little learning curve involved. Most of that will just be dialling in the grinder to get the right consistency. But with this burr grinder, it's easy to do this. Right from the start, I was getting the optimum extraction pressure dead center, as indicated by the pressure gauge. All the espresso shots had a gorgeous caramel-coloured crema that was the perfect colour, not under-extracted nor over-extracted. These shots were great. Taking the additional step of turning your espresso shots into lattes and cappuccinos could not be easier and faster thanks to the improved milk frother. It turns your milk into the perfect, textured espresso companion within about 30 seconds or less. The advanced milk frother does well with almond and cashew milk too.The dedicated temperature feature is great because allows me to adjust my brew temperature according to the type of coffee I am using. There are three temperature levels to select from which are simple and quick to use. For example, for light roasts, I will select a higher temperature in order to get a more precise extraction. On the downside, the water tank is in the back and is, therefore, a little more difficult to access than front-facing ones. On my counters, I have to pull the machine towards me, in order to properly grab the water tank. But despite this little drawback, the machine still produces incredible espressos, lattes, cappuccinos, lungos, and americanos that are simply delicious and high in quality.

They have always worked exactly as expected and without any hick-ups. This is no exception. It's well made, easy to use and has all the features a decent machine needs.There is only one item that we don't care for, so I'm going to get it out of the way first. This machine, when compared to the others, does not create as much creama. When comparing the machines, the only thing I find different is that the basket which holds the grounds does not have a single pinpoint hole through which all the coffee is forced. It seems that this tiny whole means more pressure is put on the water that then foams the coffee. The other machines are all set up that way. Here the basket has the usual screen on the bottom, and that's it. The other machines have another layer underneath the screen which is where the tiny hole is.The grinder works well, and there is enough adjustment to change up how the beans are ground which is needed depending on what kind of beans are used different roast levels.The biggest difference between this machine and the one we were using is that the older machine has the tamper built-in. As soon as the beans are ground up, we pull down a lever, and the tamping is done. Here the filter holder slips into a collar, and then together, they are slipped underneath the grinder. The collar acts as a sort of funnel. Once filled, the filter/collar combo is pulled out, the collar stays on, and the manual tamper is employed to tamp the grounds down. It's only one extra step, but I have to admit I do like having the tamper built into the machine. If I never had the older machine and only used this, I wouldn't even know it was an option, and I would be completely happy.The coffee it makes is very, very good. Having the ability to make Americano (run the process twice) or make two espresso shots is a big benefit. We did have to play with the three temperature settings for a few days t get that plus the size of grounds sorted but once set, there is no more fussing. Altogether it wasn't a complicated exercise. We just needed to experiment and find what made the best cup for us. There are two different sized filters that will fit into the holder, single shot and double, so we can choose what best suits the shot we're making. All of the De'Longhi machines we have came with the two different sizes.There is one more item that makes this very competitive when compared to the older machine; this runs about half the cost.Like the others, this is a big machine and takes up a fair bit of counter space, and because of the bean hopper on the top, it also doesn't fit under our cabinets, so open counter space is required. To the top of the hopper, it measures 17 inches.The rear-mounted water reservoir can be removed for filling, but it opens up wide enough with a flip-top lid, so we just fill it while on the machine. It's easier in our case.All said and done. This is a very good deal for a machine that makes perfect shots every time.",N/A,No

I wanted to get this particular one for 2 reasons 1) in my opinion, De’Longhi is the best and 2) I had been reading about how easy this one was to use and I’m all about that! I have a newborn and a toddler so I don’t have time to fuss around with learning how to use a new machine or waiting forever for it to make coffee. This one is super quick, extremely easy to use and has very straightforward settings and controls.The set up was a breeze and we were able to make our first espressos right after the initial clean. It has a built in grinder with 8 different levels it also features a built-in milk frother for the most delicious at-home lattes ever!I love the aesthetics of this machine and it looks gorgeous (and very high end) sitting on my counter. It fits underneath my cabinets and surprisingly, doesn’t take up too much space. The water tank is at the back of the machine which makes it look not as wide/bulky but it can be a bit of a pain to fill. I also love that it dispenses hot water (perfect for tea drinkers) eliminating my need for a kettle and therefore saving more valuable counter space.There are a few other great features that I want to highlight such as how the components are all dishwasher safe for a quick clean up and that the machine itself is very quiet when it runs. The buttons and dials on the front are straightforward and user friendly making it easy for beginners and busy people. I am thrilled with this mode and would highly recommend it to anyone out there that wants an Espresso and Latte Machine at home.

This Arte model is one of the cheaper ones from the La Specialista line. Comparing this machine to other more expensive brands, you will of course find more plastic parts and fewer options.Pros: 1. For a manual expresso machine, this was easy to use. I just followed the included instructions for the initial cleaning then to make the first cup of coffee. 2. The taste of the coffee is the most important of course. I didn't have any espresso specific beans for my first test so I just used my regular beans from Costco. Wow! The first americano out of this machine tasted so much better than from my drip coffee maker. 3. This machine looks good and fits under my cabinets. 4. The grinder has 8 levels and works great. 5. The steam wand is not pannarello so you will have to hold the cup just so to get the foam to your liking. Many old school baristas prefers this. For me, I am more of a latte person, so for me, this wand works great. 6. Detachable and dishwasher safe parts means the clean up is easier.Cons: 1. De'Longhi should have include the automatic tamper in this model (like in their La Specialista models) 2. They should have also included unpressurized baskets as well. 3. You see the nice looking cups in the listing? Na, none are included. 4. The water tanks is in the back of the machine which means refilling is inconvenient.In conclusion, this is a good manual espresso machine for beginners. It has all the basics and is forgiving so you will get a good cup of coffee without having perfect skills.",5 people found this helpful,Yes

The main difference isn't in the core performance, but rather in materials I find.  This model uses more plastics than our older machine and up close inspection isn't as impressive as more expensive models but from a few feet away it's not super obvious that it's a more budget option and honestly I've seen machines that cost four times as much still use plastics in places I thought there shouldn't be any, only that they were coated in a stainless-look paint so even if you spend a LOT more you still can't get away from the plastics these days.  You also give up things like digital displays and controls but at the end of the day, these are things that you stop thinking about a week after using a machine.  If this were a superautomatic and everything else remained the same about heating performance (which is great) and construction it would probably be a machine with twice the sticker price.The operation despite having ""basic"" controls is intuitive and it's still very much an easy to use machine that I find hard to make a bad drink from.  I have no real complaints about usability but a couple of situational niggles that apply to my kitchen that may not apply to yours.  The main one is that the machine is quite chunky both width and height wise for a manual unit, it takes a bit more horizontal room than other options.  Our upper cabinets are slightly lower over the counter than standard due to the upper cabinets being a bit taller than average and the raised hopper on this is something that is more difficult to fill without pulling the machine out from under the cabinets every time.  Overall though, it's still not the biggest manual out there and most people should have no problem housing it in the kitchen I think.The grinder works really well, actually, I think it works better than a $2000+ superautomatic I've used in the past.  The hopper doesn't seem as prone to getting beans stuck in it but I have been buying beans that I specifically choose for low oil for years now to avoid problems with automatic grinders.  The straight forward hopper design does seem to help though as our previous machine has a lot off weird crevices in the hopper area that force me to get in there and spread them around frequently.  The number of grind settings I think is more than adequate to get the drink you want though it is less than some other options, I suggest starting with setting 5 and adjusting from there.  I don't often use milk and have never been very good at using steam wands but the one on this model seems to work well, give you good control and produces steam very quickly turning on and off quickly without much delay and with more than enough quantity to make short work of it - I didn't feel like it got out of control on me.",One person found this helpful,No

As with all hybrids, the machine is divided into two workstations. The left is dedicated to grinding beans, compacting, and dosing, while the right is where you’ll find the brew head, automatic milk wand, and hot water outlet. I am, by no means, a professional espresso maker, but I do enjoy a good espresso martini and I do love my Starbucks. The machine comes with easy to read and follow instructions that will help even the inexperienced barista produce a well brewed beverage. This machine is more than perfect for the novice espresso maker. I love that it comes with a milk frother, as my favourite thing to drink is a latte. The machine itself is beautiful and something that I absolutely LOVE having on my counter top permanently. I have tried a variety of different roasts, brands, and coffee beans, and have yet to be disappointed in the espresso and coffee drinks that come out of the machine. An added bonus to the machine is that I often enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon or evenings, and I no longer need to use a kettle of any kind, as this machine dispenses hot water for tea with the push of a button. No, it is not as fast as an automatic machine, and it has a slight learning curve, but once you start using it and drinking the coffee, you will understand the value in taking a few extra minutes. I HIGHLY recommend watching product videos on making espresso and frothing milk in order to perfect the art.  I highly recommend this to anyone who drinks specialty coffee and likes having a great consistent cup every time. Love it a latte!",One person found this helpful,No

It's easy to use and there is a little learning curve involved. Most of that will just be dialling in the grinder to get the right consistency. But with this burr grinder, it's easy to do this. Right from the start, I was getting the optimum extraction pressure dead center, as indicated by the pressure gauge. All the espresso shots had a gorgeous caramel-coloured crema that was the perfect colour, not under-extracted nor over-extracted. These shots were great. Taking the additional step of turning your espresso shots into lattes and cappuccinos could not be easier and faster thanks to the improved milk frother. It turns your milk into the perfect, textured espresso companion within about 30 seconds or less. The advanced milk frother does well with almond and cashew milk too.The dedicated temperature feature is great because allows me to adjust my brew temperature according to the type of coffee I am using. There are three temperature levels to select from which are simple and quick to use. For example, for light roasts, I will select a higher temperature in order to get a more precise extraction. On the downside, the water tank is in the back and is, therefore, a little more difficult to access than front-facing ones. On my counters, I have to pull the machine towards me, in order to properly grab the water tank. But despite this little drawback, the machine still produces incredible espressos, lattes, cappuccinos, lungos, and americanos that are simply delicious and high in quality.

They have always worked exactly as expected and without any hick-ups. This is no exception. It's well made, easy to use and has all the features a decent machine needs.There is only one item that we don't care for, so I'm going to get it out of the way first. This machine, when compared to the others, does not create as much creama. When comparing the machines, the only thing I find different is that the basket which holds the grounds does not have a single pinpoint hole through which all the coffee is forced. It seems that this tiny whole means more pressure is put on the water that then foams the coffee. The other machines are all set up that way. Here the basket has the usual screen on the bottom, and that's it. The other machines have another layer underneath the screen which is where the tiny hole is.The grinder works well, and there is enough adjustment to change up how the beans are ground which is needed depending on what kind of beans are used different roast levels.The biggest difference between this machine and the one we were using is that the older machine has the tamper built-in. As soon as the beans are ground up, we pull down a lever, and the tamping is done. Here the filter holder slips into a collar, and then together, they are slipped underneath the grinder. The collar acts as a sort of funnel. Once filled, the filter/collar combo is pulled out, the collar stays on, and the manual tamper is employed to tamp the grounds down. It's only one extra step, but I have to admit I do like having the tamper built into the machine. If I never had the older machine and only used this, I wouldn't even know it was an option, and I would be completely happy.The coffee it makes is very, very good. Having the ability to make Americano (run the process twice) or make two espresso shots is a big benefit. We did have to play with the three temperature settings for a few days t get that plus the size of grounds sorted but once set, there is no more fussing. Altogether it wasn't a complicated exercise. We just needed to experiment and find what made the best cup for us. There are two different sized filters that will fit into the holder, single shot and double, so we can choose what best suits the shot we're making. All of the De'Longhi machines we have came with the two different sizes.There is one more item that makes this very competitive when compared to the older machine; this runs about half the cost.Like the others, this is a big machine and takes up a fair bit of counter space, and because of the bean hopper on the top, it also doesn't fit under our cabinets, so open counter space is required. To the top of the hopper, it measures 17 inches.The rear-mounted water reservoir can be removed for filling, but it opens up wide enough with a flip-top lid, so we just fill it while on the machine. It's easier in our case.All said and done. This is a very good deal for a machine that makes perfect shots every time.",N/A,No

I wanted to get this particular one for 2 reasons 1) in my opinion, De’Longhi is the best and 2) I had been reading about how easy this one was to use and I’m all about that! I have a newborn and a toddler so I don’t have time to fuss around with learning how to use a new machine or waiting forever for it to make coffee. This one is super quick, extremely easy to use and has very straightforward settings and controls.The set up was a breeze and we were able to make our first espressos right after the initial clean. It has a built in grinder with 8 different levels it also features a built-in milk frother for the most delicious at-home lattes ever!I love the aesthetics of this machine and it looks gorgeous (and very high end) sitting on my counter. It fits underneath my cabinets and surprisingly, doesn’t take up too much space. The water tank is at the back of the machine which makes it look not as wide/bulky but it can be a bit of a pain to fill. I also love that it dispenses hot water (perfect for tea drinkers) eliminating my need for a kettle and therefore saving more valuable counter space.There are a few other great features that I want to highlight such as how the components are all dishwasher safe for a quick clean up and that the machine itself is very quiet when it runs. The buttons and dials on the front are straightforward and user friendly making it easy for beginners and busy people. I am thrilled with this mode and would highly recommend it to anyone out there that wants an Espresso and Latte Machine at home.

Once you have it unboxed and set up, which isn’t too hard, you’re probably going to want to keep it in one place as it’s not light or easy to move.I’m a very simple person when it comes to my tastes in coffee and espresso, so this unit already has more options than I would ever need. You’ve got multiple choices for drink size, intensity of the coffee, and much more, as well as a steam wand. You can even use the wand to make latte art, but I’ve never been able to actually pull that off. There are three presets for espresso, Americano and just simple hot water, which will probably cover what 90% of people need a machine like this for.Having a built-in grinder is one of those features that will be absolutely invaluable to most people. It makes life much easier and in my experience this one has worked extremely well (with minimal noise). Being able to select from 8 different options for grinding lets you customise what you need depending on your beans, how strong you want your espresso to be, and more. If you like the best coffee, grinding it fresh is a must, but if you don’t need or want a grinder, this isn’t the ideal option.In terms of cleanup, having some parts be dishwasher safe is a huge bonus for me, and it also comes with some barista tools that help you keep things neat and tidy while making your espresso. Overall I think this machine does a good job of holding your hand and making it easy to go from coffee beans to a delicious espresso with very little effort.

Over time, this new acquired taste spread to me through osmosis and we both garnered a liking for the perfectly brewed espresso shot. This meant that coffee was no longer only consumed for its effects but now also for its taste. We always bought our espresso outside and enjoyed drinking it together while sitting down in a coffee shop somewhere but since the pandemic began, this tradition was harder and harder to do. The same cup of espresso isn't the same when you have to wear a mask between sips.We knew that there are machines out there that can make professional barista-level espresso at home but we always thought they were complicated to operate. I mean, after all, a barista is a professional that acquires the necessary skills to produce the perfect coffee beverage using specialized tools from their toolbox. This is why it came as a complete surprise to us that an all-in-one machine can produce the perfect espresso shot and it doesn't take a college course consumed over a semester to learn how to use it.The controls of this machine are intuitive but reading through the instructions manual is necessary to get you started. To provide a high-level summary, the coffee beans are first ground up in the included grinder. Then they are transferred to to the tamper where they are compressed. Then hot pressurized water is forced through the grounds to extract all the goodness from them.This espresso machine is featured with 3 brew temperatures. The difference between this model and the slightly higher models is the exclusion of the built-in tamper. This model does not come with the lever-style tamper built into the machine itself. This isn't a huge deal, especially if you enjoy the manual tamping process. It does however come with a steaming wand to froth milk to the perfect consistency for making latte art.This machine's stainless steal finish fits perfectly on any modern kitchen's countertop space. It looks, feels, and functions like a professional piece of equipment. Aside from the economics of saving money over the long-term by not having to purchase espresso from coffee shops, the process of making them at home has become so enjoyable that it's almost its own treat.

Looking at the value the Arte provides, it would be a no-brainer to go with this one.To be honest, I love a good latte and enjoy my daily coffee in the morning, but would not classify myself as a coffee aficionado. That being said, I certainly can tell when an espresso is not the best quality. This espresso machine makes it easy to make your own espresso at home, even for beginners. Coffee is hot, aromatic, and tastes great.There aren’t many drawbacks to this machine, however it isn’t perfect. The build quality is nice, but some of the plastics could be metal to make it feel more premium. Other than that, I was quite impressed with the quality of this machine.

   Full disclosure I have never tried an espresso before getting this machine and certainly had never tried making one on my own. Yes I know, that in itself is a huge crime.  But I am a coffee lover so I knew I needed to give this a try.  And boy was I missing out.  The flavor and aroma, amazing!The instructions for set up were clear, colored photographs that were easy to follow.  The colored guide even had information on what grind to use for the coffee beans you are using.  We ran hot water through it twice to do the cleaning before beginning and washed all of the washable parts in hot soapy water.Because I was so new to this type of machine it took me a couple of tries to get things figured out and to make the perfect cup.  I also didn't own any espresso mugs/cups so bare with me using the regular mug.The espresso came out a beautiful caramel color as it was brewing and was the perfect consistency and flavor (again my first espresso so I have nothing to compare it to other than knowing it tasted amazing)!  I then brewed a couple of americano's for myself and my daughters boyfriend.  Again, amazing quality, amazing flavor and the perfect brew.It took me a couple of tries to get the milk frothed properly but once I figured it out it worked well on subsequent uses.I like that this unit has a water tank attached so I do not need to fill it every single time I go to make something.  I also like that I can get a cup of hot water if I want to have a tea or hot chocolate and that eliminates the need to have my kettle on my counter all the time.The unit itself is very well made, and looks very nice.  It fits on my counter under my upper cabinets with room to spare, which I like because I can push it back against the wall neatly.  The grate on the bottom for catching water spillage is plastic, this is by far the cheapest looking/feeling part of the whole machine, but so far I haven't had any issues with it.The grind is amazing, it makes great grind every single time.Such great quality machine that looks great, is high end, makes a perfect cup and is quiet sounding.This product is a 10/10 for me.",N/A,No

You have a grind setting below the hopper, a ""dose"" knob to add more or less coffee to the portafilter, and a temperature button (three levels).It will likely take several tries before you get the perfect cup of coffee, since each variable can have a profound impact on the quality of the cup you make. The quick start guide has some very helpful information in this regard and gives you some default settings to try for different roasts. It took us about 4 tries to get a very good espresso.The water storage container is at the back of the unit and can be removed to fill if needed. Unfortunately, this machine does require you to go through all the steps to make coffee - there is no ""automatic"" setting on this, so some family members may not appreciate that. But for anyone who's willing to put in the time to get the settings right (must be done for every different coffee you buy) then they will be rewarded with excellent results.",N/A,No

I want to commend the manufacturer as this is a step that many companies skip.  I would not have been able to set it up and get it working without those instructions or downloading a video on how to set the product up.  The instructions even suggest how coarse and fine you should grind your coffee along with the dose level depending on which type of coffee it is.  This is not something that I would have considered in the past. Once I had a few minutes to read the manual, I followed the instructions and the setup proceeded quickly and I was able to do the initial rinse and then brew a heavenly tasting cup of strong coffee.  If I could give this ten stars, I would.  The odd thing is that I used the same coffee that I always use and it tasted better through the grinding and brewing. I followed the guide to how to grind and brew the particular type of coffee (medium roast Columbian). In addition to the grind and dosing you can also adjust the temperature.The process is two steps.  You grind the coffee beans in the built in grinder.  It serves up a dose of coffee into the portafilter where you tamp it down with the provided tamping tool and then insert it into brewing portion of the machine where you can select espresso, a regular cup of coffee (Americana) or just hot water.This will get a lot of use in my house and it provides a cup of coffee that tastes as good as the one that comes out of a machine that costs double or triple what this one costs.  This is an excellent, excellent product.Addendum:  I have been using this to try different coffees that I have tried previously once again and it does make the coffee taste better than it does in a regular coffee brewer.  Coffee that I thought of as bland has a much better taste, and I even find that I like coffee without sweetener or milk when it comes out of this machine.",N/A,No

A mix of high quality plastics and metals- Relatively compact design when compared to the higher end De'Longhi Specialista Maestro- Provides everything you need for manual espresso and cappucino making at home along with all the customizability that comes with the manual experience- Conical bean grinder works great, produces very consistent results across the different grind levels- Parts are all dish washer safe, making clean up easy- Great value for money when comparing this to something like the Breville barista expressCons:- Some of the ergonomics aren't the best. Because of the compact design, this also means that everything is set up a little closer together than I'd like. In particular the milk frothing wand isn't in a great position, and I find I have to angle my milk frothing pitcher quite a bit to get it out, causing it to spill milk sometimes if my pitcher is particularly full- No ability to remove the bean container, making it a bit tougher to swap out beansOverall:I've been really happy with this manual espresso and cappucino maker from De'longhi. I've had a number of their automatic machines at this point, so it's been exciting to try out their manual espresso maker. Bean grinding is still manual with the high quality, built in conical grinder, but tamping your coffee grounds and frothing your milk are all on you now. It definitely gives you a greater level of customizability to your drinks and can be a lot of fun. With the ongoing pandemic, WFH is definitely sticking around, so I do find I have a bit more time in the morning to enjoy the actual coffee making process, and this has been a great way to facilitate that. Build quality is excellent and beyond some minor quality of life issues, this is a really great budget option to get into a more manual coffee experience without breaking the bank on the higher end maestro model + save you a fair amount compared to the Breville Barista Express. 100% would recommend!",N/A,No

   It's hard to review this product within the confines of an Amazon review. I need to distill my impressions into a relatively short text.Pros:- Quality grinder, the grind seems to be very uniform, and can achieve pretty fine grind.- Has water tank level sensor. My previous machine could not detect when it's out of water.- Quality seems to be pretty high. The portafilter and the tamper have quite a bit of heft to them, and are pleasant to use.- No mess under the grinder.- Space saving, due to not needing a separate grinder.- Goes into energy saving sleep mode after a time out. My previous machine would stay hot for hours if I forgot to turn it off.- Has a nice storage compartment under the lid on the top, for all the small accessories.- Water reservoir is easy to detach and reattach without completely sliding the machine out and turning.- Good design of the froth wand. It can be swung ""overboard"" for dipping in and out of milk, and can be brought over the main drain area, so that you could submerse it in water for cleaning.- There is enough control for grind quality, and quantity.- There is good control of temperature.- All functions (grinding, extracting, frothing) are quieter than on my previous machine.Cons:-  Very little control over the amount of water used for espresso extraction. Basically, only two amounts are provided (single and double). I would prefer a handle that would allow adjusting the amount of water to be a bit more or less. Or even a fully manual mode, where I would turn the water flow off myself.- It's next to impossible to switch out the beans. The hopper is not removable, so you'd have to flip the entire machine over to remove the remainder of the beans.- I would prefer design without the need for the dozing funnel. It's a part that I am not convinced is really needed.- The water reservoir is very flat, it will be very hard to wash inside it, since my hand (and, I think, even smaller hands) cannot get inside. This may be an issue if you don't use the machine for some time, and may want to wash the water tank.Overall, I'm sure that this machine is far from being ""perfect"", for somebody who's crazy about coffee. However, it's definitely a step up for me from my much cheaper machine. I'm still trying to find the settings that suit me best, but this would be true with any new machine.I'm quite happy with this espresso machine so far.",N/A,No

Once you have it unboxed and set up, which isn’t too hard, you’re probably going to want to keep it in one place as it’s not light or easy to move.I’m a very simple person when it comes to my tastes in coffee and espresso, so this unit already has more options than I would ever need. You’ve got multiple choices for drink size, intensity of the coffee, and much more, as well as a steam wand. You can even use the wand to make latte art, but I’ve never been able to actually pull that off. There are three presets for espresso, Americano and just simple hot water, which will probably cover what 90% of people need a machine like this for.Having a built-in grinder is one of those features that will be absolutely invaluable to most people. It makes life much easier and in my experience this one has worked extremely well (with minimal noise). Being able to select from 8 different options for grinding lets you customise what you need depending on your beans, how strong you want your espresso to be, and more. If you like the best coffee, grinding it fresh is a must, but if you don’t need or want a grinder, this isn’t the ideal option.In terms of cleanup, having some parts be dishwasher safe is a huge bonus for me, and it also comes with some barista tools that help you keep things neat and tidy while making your espresso.

Over time, this new acquired taste spread to me through osmosis and we both garnered a liking for the perfectly brewed espresso shot. This meant that coffee was no longer only consumed for its effects but now also for its taste. We always bought our espresso outside and enjoyed drinking it together while sitting down in a coffee shop somewhere but since the pandemic began, this tradition was harder and harder to do. The same cup of espresso isn't the same when you have to wear a mask between sips.We knew that there are machines out there that can make professional barista-level espresso at home but we always thought they were complicated to operate. I mean, after all, a barista is a professional that acquires the necessary skills to produce the perfect coffee beverage using specialized tools from their toolbox. This is why it came as a complete surprise to us that an all-in-one machine can produce the perfect espresso shot and it doesn't take a college course consumed over a semester to learn how to use it.The controls of this machine are intuitive but reading through the instructions manual is necessary to get you started. To provide a high-level summary, the coffee beans are first ground up in the included grinder. Then they are transferred to to the tamper where they are compressed. Then hot pressurized water is forced through the grounds to extract all the goodness from them.This espresso machine is featured with 3 brew temperatures. The difference between this model and the slightly higher models is the exclusion of the built-in tamper. This model does not come with the lever-style tamper built into the machine itself. This isn't a huge deal, especially if you enjoy the manual tamping process. It does however come with a steaming wand to froth milk to the perfect consistency for making latte art.This machine's stainless steal finish fits perfectly on any modern kitchen's countertop space. It looks, feels, and functions like a professional piece of equipment. Aside from the economics of saving money over the long-term by not having to purchase espresso from coffee shops, the process of making them at home has become so enjoyable that it's almost its own treat.

   Full disclosure I have never tried an espresso before getting this machine and certainly had never tried making one on my own. Yes I know, that in itself is a huge crime.  But I am a coffee lover so I knew I needed to give this a try.  And boy was I missing out.  The flavor and aroma, amazing!The instructions for set up were clear, colored photographs that were easy to follow.  The colored guide even had information on what grind to use for the coffee beans you are using.  We ran hot water through it twice to do the cleaning before beginning and washed all of the washable parts in hot soapy water.Because I was so new to this type of machine it took me a couple of tries to get things figured out and to make the perfect cup.  I also didn't own any espresso mugs/cups so bare with me using the regular mug.The espresso came out a beautiful caramel color as it was brewing and was the perfect consistency and flavor (again my first espresso so I have nothing to compare it to other than knowing it tasted amazing)!  I then brewed a couple of americano's for myself and my daughters boyfriend.  Again, amazing quality, amazing flavor and the perfect brew.It took me a couple of tries to get the milk frothed properly but once I figured it out it worked well on subsequent uses.I like that this unit has a water tank attached so I do not need to fill it every single time I go to make something.  I also like that I can get a cup of hot water if I want to have a tea or hot chocolate and that eliminates the need to have my kettle on my counter all the time.The unit itself is very well made, and looks very nice.  It fits on my counter under my upper cabinets with room to spare, which I like because I can push it back against the wall neatly.  The grate on the bottom for catching water spillage is plastic, this is by far the cheapest looking/feeling part of the whole machine, but so far I haven't had any issues with it.The grind is amazing, it makes great grind every single time.Such great quality machine that looks great, is high end, makes a perfect cup and is quiet sounding.This product is a 10/10 for me.",N/A,No

Nous buvons plutôt des lattés ou des cappucinos, mais nous sommes même addict à nos cafés matinal.Positifs:- Pour une machine manuelle, elle est facile d'utilisation- Machine au look moderne- Le moulin à grain offre une grande variété de choix de moulure pour votre café (8)- Le café est frais et goûteux.- Les pièces sont facilement nettoyables- Le mousseur à lait à vapeur est facilement maléable et permet de chauffer le lait et de le mousserselon ses goûts, soit plus mousseux ou peu mousseux.Négatifs :- Le panier à espresso est maintenu sous pression, donc lorsqu'il est temps de retirer le café du panier, il est difficile de le faire .- Il faut compresser soit-même le café moulu- Les superbes verres à espresso présent dans la publicité ne sont pas inclus.- La réserve d'eau est à l'arrière, donc si vous placez la machine sous un cabinet, il sera difficile de la remplir.- Nous avons essayer d'utiliser du café déjà moulu puisque nous aimons les cafés à saveur. Par contre, il est difficile de le compresser suffisament pour atteindre une pression suffisante lorsque le café coule. Le goût n'est donc pas aussi fort et goûteux.En conclusion, c'est une machine espresso manuelle très efficace pour les débutants. N'ayant jamais eu de machine à espresso, nous sommes plus que ravi de savourer nos lattés, cappucinos et américano grâce à cette machine De'longhi.",N/A,No

This De'longhi brings back fond memories and annoyed moments of cleaning up coffee grinds from everywhere.I drank brewed filtered coffee all my life, except when I worked at this cafe, and it feels good buying bean, grinding, tamping and drinking a decent double shot of espresso. Compared to two giant cups of coffee that gets cold quickly!Things I like about this machine:-Simple to get the process down, tricky to measure dosage and temperature for your specific beans. Everyone has a preference, but not often is it brewed to be easy to drink.-Feels high quality, every single part feels solid-Grinder is much quieter then my ceramic burr, it works very well for a consumer level product, makes fine grinds-Dosing tool and tamp is more useful then I realize-Can make consistent shotsThings I wish were better-The rubberized feet are not grippy enough, when I lock the portafilter, it sometimes moves the whole machine. Using a shelf liner (the grippy kind) fixed it but locking in the filter is a two handed task. One to hold the machine and the other to lock it in.-The rear water reservoir is hard to clean and hard to see water levels. A less narrow side water reservoir (in a cube shape) would be easier. A small LED that lights up the water level when turned on would also be helpful.-The storage on the top is barely useful, more space would be nice-No knock box, I know, I know, that would add to cost but literally its the last thing you need!-Wet puck, hard to dispose of, but I think this is just a grinder issue....still need to play around with the dosage and grind level*No comments:-Steam wand seems to work well, lactose intolerant, don't think I'll use it but its cool ya?Overall, this is a fantastic consumer level espresso machine for a small home, or  an apartment.

We ended up putting this on a slider to be able to pull it out more easily for filling for both the beans and water.  I wish that Delonghi incorporated some of their design smarts (ie, side loading water tank) from their superautomatics that I have been using under a cabinet comfortably into this. That said, this is very possibly a me problem as I could always pop this on the counter unobstructed by cabinetry.The machine produced a pretty good shot of espresso and we enjoyed using it.

You have a grind setting below the hopper, a ""dose"" knob to add more or less coffee to the portafilter, and a temperature button (three levels).It will likely take several tries before you get the perfect cup of coffee, since each variable can have a profound impact on the quality of the cup you make. The quick start guide has some very helpful information in this regard and gives you some default settings to try for different roasts. It took us about 4 tries to get a very good espresso.The water storage container is at the back of the unit and can be removed to fill if needed. Unfortunately, this machine does require you to go through all the steps to make coffee - there is no ""automatic"" setting on this, so some family members may not appreciate that. But for anyone who's willing to put in the time to get the settings right (must be done for every different coffee you buy) then they will be rewarded with excellent results.",N/A,No

I want to commend the manufacturer as this is a step that many companies skip.  I would not have been able to set it up and get it working without those instructions or downloading a video on how to set the product up.  The instructions even suggest how coarse and fine you should grind your coffee along with the dose level depending on which type of coffee it is.  This is not something that I would have considered in the past. Once I had a few minutes to read the manual, I followed the instructions and the setup proceeded quickly and I was able to do the initial rinse and then brew a heavenly tasting cup of strong coffee.  If I could give this ten stars, I would.  The odd thing is that I used the same coffee that I always use and it tasted better through the grinding and brewing. I followed the guide to how to grind and brew the particular type of coffee (medium roast Columbian). In addition to the grind and dosing you can also adjust the temperature.The process is two steps.  You grind the coffee beans in the built in grinder.  It serves up a dose of coffee into the portafilter where you tamp it down with the provided tamping tool and then insert it into brewing portion of the machine where you can select espresso, a regular cup of coffee (Americana) or just hot water.This will get a lot of use in my house and it provides a cup of coffee that tastes as good as the one that comes out of a machine that costs double or triple what this one costs.  This is an excellent, excellent product.Addendum:  I have been using this to try different coffees that I have tried previously once again and it does make the coffee taste better than it does in a regular coffee brewer.  Coffee that I thought of as bland has a much better taste, and I even find that I like coffee without sweetener or milk when it comes out of this machine.",N/A,No

A mix of high quality plastics and metals- Relatively compact design when compared to the higher end De'Longhi Specialista Maestro- Provides everything you need for manual espresso and cappucino making at home along with all the customizability that comes with the manual experience- Conical bean grinder works great, produces very consistent results across the different grind levels- Parts are all dish washer safe, making clean up easy- Great value for money when comparing this to something like the Breville barista expressCons:- Some of the ergonomics aren't the best. Because of the compact design, this also means that everything is set up a little closer together than I'd like. In particular the milk frothing wand isn't in a great position, and I find I have to angle my milk frothing pitcher quite a bit to get it out, causing it to spill milk sometimes if my pitcher is particularly full- No ability to remove the bean container, making it a bit tougher to swap out beansOverall:I've been really happy with this manual espresso and cappucino maker from De'longhi. I've had a number of their automatic machines at this point, so it's been exciting to try out their manual espresso maker. Bean grinding is still manual with the high quality, built in conical grinder, but tamping your coffee grounds and frothing your milk are all on you now. It definitely gives you a greater level of customizability to your drinks and can be a lot of fun. With the ongoing pandemic, WFH is definitely sticking around, so I do find I have a bit more time in the morning to enjoy the actual coffee making process, and this has been a great way to facilitate that. Build quality is excellent and beyond some minor quality of life issues, this is a really great budget option to get into a more manual coffee experience without breaking the bank on the higher end maestro model + save you a fair amount compared to the Breville Barista Express. 100% would recommend!",N/A,No

   It's hard to review this product within the confines of an Amazon review. I need to distill my impressions into a relatively short text.Pros:- Quality grinder, the grind seems to be very uniform, and can achieve pretty fine grind.- Has water tank level sensor. My previous machine could not detect when it's out of water.- Quality seems to be pretty high. The portafilter and the tamper have quite a bit of heft to them, and are pleasant to use.- No mess under the grinder.- Space saving, due to not needing a separate grinder.- Goes into energy saving sleep mode after a time out. My previous machine would stay hot for hours if I forgot to turn it off.- Has a nice storage compartment under the lid on the top, for all the small accessories.- Water reservoir is easy to detach and reattach without completely sliding the machine out and turning.- Good design of the froth wand. It can be swung ""overboard"" for dipping in and out of milk, and can be brought over the main drain area, so that you could submerse it in water for cleaning.- There is enough control for grind quality, and quantity.- There is good control of temperature.- All functions (grinding, extracting, frothing) are quieter than on my previous machine.Cons:-  Very little control over the amount of water used for espresso extraction. Basically, only two amounts are provided (single and double). I would prefer a handle that would allow adjusting the amount of water to be a bit more or less. Or even a fully manual mode, where I would turn the water flow off myself.- It's next to impossible to switch out the beans. The hopper is not removable, so you'd have to flip the entire machine over to remove the remainder of the beans.- I would prefer design without the need for the dozing funnel. It's a part that I am not convinced is really needed.- The water reservoir is very flat, it will be very hard to wash inside it, since my hand (and, I think, even smaller hands) cannot get inside. This may be an issue if you don't use the machine for some time, and may want to wash the water tank.Overall, I'm sure that this machine is far from being ""perfect"", for somebody who's crazy about coffee. However, it's definitely a step up for me from my much cheaper machine. I'm still trying to find the settings that suit me best, but this would be true with any new machine.I'm quite happy with this espresso machine so far.",N/A,No

I am, however, quite the Starbucks lover. I am married to an ex-barista who is quite the snob about drinking coffee at home. I am not as picky, but I know a good cup of coffee when I have one in front of me. I figured between the two of our tastes and experiences that we could provide a well-rounded review. Setup was fairly simple. After yelling at my husband to read the instructions for the fifth time, it got cleaned & put together in about 20 minutes. This machine does not include the water softener filter so if you deal with hard water, plan to buy one in addition to the price of this machine. We’ve made two drinks so far and both have been amazing. We’ve made an iced caramel macchiato and a vanilla latte. The flavor is strong and brewed just right. Even for me, with no experience working an espresso machine, it was easy enough to figure out. Prep, brew, & clean up time took a total of 6 minutes from whole beans in the grinder to finished grinds in the trash. To compare to how much you’re spending on coffee already, when broken into daily payments over a year, it ends up being about $2.05. Way less than a grande or vente Starbucks drink price and according to the hubs way better in taste! I spent maybe $15 on Starbucks coffee beans, more almond milk, and some caramel drizzle that will last me over a month. Although it’s a lump sum in the beginning, you will be glad you made the investment. This machine is well worth it.UPDATE ON 8-11-19:I’m updating my review to add a few very important notes that I have learned since I posted my original review:1. Any coffee beans are “espresso” beans. This is probably basic knowledge to some, but I didn’t know that! I spent a good 30 minutes in publix looking for “espresso” beans. Lol.. live & learn.2. Watch all the YouTube videos! Making the perfect shot of espresso takes practice. I went to Costco & bought a big bag of beans and made about twenty shots just trying to perfect my skill!3. Only put the beans in the grinder before you go to make a cup. It makes for a much fresher tasting espresso.4. If you’re going to be making lots of espresso, invest in a good set of espresso glasses. I originally was using a stainless steel shot glass I had and my finger tips about burned off! I ordered JoyJolt double walled espresso glasses (the 2 oz ones) on Amazon and they have been a lovey addition to my morning espresso routine.5. The machine will stop grinding depending on where you turn the knob. I have found for a single shot of espresso, turning the grinder knob to the center and just a tad to the left that it makes the perfect amount for a great shot of espresso.6. The closer the espresso glass is to where the espresso is coming out is important! It creates a thicker level of crema.That’s about all I can think of right now.

Buyer Beware!,"If you are considering getting this machine... read on so you have a sense of what to expect.  If you have already, I sincerely hope your experience is better than ours.We have had this machine for about a year and a half.  About 4 months ago, the grinder stopped working.  It took me 40 min to get a hold of some one @ DeLonghi to get a repair (neve rmind online, where they promise a reply within 2 business days and I did not get any reply for over a month!).They did honor the 2 year warranty and repaired it at no charge... except that it took weeks to even get the box/paper work to send it to them and a couple of weeks to get it back (the latter, honestly, I was ok with).We have had it back now for about a month... and this morning it stopped working... again!  Now the computer thinks the water tank is empty (it is not, and we have inserted/re-inserted the tank several times), and wants to run the set up program (which we have run 4-5 times already)... to no avail!I am incredibly frustrated!  This was not a cheap item.  This was $800 and I would have expected better quality and better customer service.  I am at a loss. I was hoping for a better experience.  Now, I am back to my trusty coffee pot on the stove... until I figure something out.Still here are some comments I have for you to consider about the machine itself.What I love...It is relatively easy to set up and use... almost foolproof!It heats up quicklyIt is quieter than othersLots of features to make different drinks easilyFoams milk like a dreamThe tamping feature is really cool!  It helps control the mess and keep things tidy!But...There are several design “flaws”  you should be aware of...It is a tall machine... we have it under the upper cabinets and to get it in and out we have to take off the coffee bean hopper lidI absolutely dislike the fact you cannot take the hopper off when it is full of beans.  So, you are “stuck” with whatever beans you put in.  Other machines I have had lock the beans in and you can remove the hopper and the beans if you desire to change the coffee... which we do!It has only 6 grinder settings... we have it set one notch above the finest grind setting and we still are not getting the intensity of flavor we were used to get with other machines.  I wish there were more grind settings.I hope this helps you make a more informed decision.",162 people found this helpful,Yes

The most popular high end machine for making espresso at home has been the Breville Barista Express.  But that machine has a high learning curve.  Just learning to choose the right grind size from the many available options or consistently tamping the grounds with the right amount of pressure takes a lot of practice (and wasted coffee).  Not to mention learning to use the steam wand properly for milk based drinks.  You can spend about 4 times as much as the Breville would cost you to buy a superautomatic machine that makes really good espresso, such as the various Jura models.  Or you could spend just a little more money than the Breville and buy a machine like this new De'Longhi La Specialista Prestigio espresso machine, which automates some of the steps that are hard to master but still allows you more control over the process than a superautomatic machine would.  This De'Longhi only offers 6 choices for grind size, but with the built in sensor grinding technology, you don't need to be as precise when dialing in the grid size as you would need to be with a less advanced machine.  But perhaps the most useful feature of this machine is the smart tamping feature, which takes care of using just the right amount of pressure to tamp the grounds so you don't need to worry about that.  So whether you are a beginner or an expert when it comes to making your own espresso, you will always get more consistent results with this machine.  The steam wand is improved over previous De'Longhi models, but it does take a while to master the skill of using it to make really good lattes and cappuccinos.  However, after a little practice it didn't take me long to get much better results than I have been able to get with any other espresso machine I have used.  Overall this is a very nice machine, and probably the best value in a home espresso machine for under $1,000 that you will find anywhere.",61 people found this helpful,No

I love making mochas and capuchinos, but I have such a hard time trying to frothing and texturizing the milk to the creamer consistency to make lattes. With the Breville this process was a breeze. I was about tho give up and return this De’Longhi to Amazon and get another Breville instead. I did find a technique were I’m able to get the cream with this one to make my lattes, unfortunately it has been a 50/50 right outcome.

My last was a Breville Oracle that finally died after 3 years.  In deciding what to replace it with I evaluated what I wanted to use it for.  For the last few years I only drink Americanos and to a lesser extent, Lattes.  So I wasn’t looking for an espresso machine to produce god shots for drinking straight espresso, but something more than good enough to produce excellent Americanos and Lattes.  The La Specialista met that quite well.It is easy to use and since I was well experienced with espresso making, dialing it in to produce great coffee was quick and easy.  From power on to ready to use is about a minute.  Then I do a blind shot to heat up the portafilter as a cold portafilter will negatively affect the espresso produced.  I leave the empty portafilter in the machine and use the Rinse button to get the preheat done.  Grinding works well as does the built in tamping with a side effect of not being as messy as using a separate grinder with a tamper often is.  One concern with the grinder is that to make good espresso the grind setting needs to be very close to the minimum grind size and over time, as the grinder burrs wear that will probably become an issue.  Fortunately DeLonghi sells a replacement upper burr for that very issue.Steaming excellent and nearly automatic for Lattes or Flat Whites, but I think it is a little weak for a cappuccino.  Cleaning of the steam wand is dead simple and since the wand is a no-burn type, cleaning off the outside is easy too.The various button combinations for changing some default settings work well and are well documented in the user manual.  The First Start pamphlet is excellent and well presented so getting the machines ready for that first use is really easy.",26 people found this helpful,Yes

The previous one was a Krupps fully automatic machine, made really good coffee but like all machines do at some point, it decided to die.There are quite a few machines in the $1200+ range and a few in the $600-1200 range, which is the price range I was looking at. I had short-listed to Gaggia vs Philips, leaning more towards Gaggia but reports of their poor customer service was disconcerting. Both of these are fully automatic. De'Longhi had the semi-automatic Magnifica but it didn't look pleasing aesthetically as far as matching the rest of my kitchen goes. Breville seemed a little too much work with manual tamping - as in, you actually take the tamper and press into the portafilter to tamp.Almost as I was finally ready to buy, I see this De'Longhi - la specialista. I have had this machine for about two weeks now.It is a semi-automatic machine. Its not a press-one-button-and-get-coffee machine, you will have to do some, a little, bit of work. Meaning, attach the portafilter to the grind unit and then the brew unit. Not a lot of work, and it actually feels good to be doing that!!Build quality is really really good. I am hard pressed to tell plastic from steel parts. Sides have the brushed steel look and chrome trims and I have no idea what is plastic. A very solid, well built machine. It looks really really good sitting on the counter, especially with that black 'dashboard' with the pressure gauge dominating the facade. The portafilter is solid and surprisingly heavy - you could easily use it for defense in case of burglary or something !! Same solid build is seen also in the included frothing mug and the filters, as well as the steel drip tray grill. Rest of the drip tray is plastic - the one place where plastic is obviously plastic.Power button turns it on of course - there's a master on/off switch in the back. Also in the back is a water reservoir which is surprisingly large.Attaching the portafilter to the grinder starts the grinding automatically. The machine will grind coffee for one or two shots if you press the 2x button.This is where my only frustration with the machine arose - frustration that has since been resolved. Start with factory default settings - fineness at 3 and amount of coffee dial at about 10 o'clock position. I was too impatient and started playing with the dials causing the machine to grind EXCESSIVE amounts of coffee and essentially malfunction. Ground coffee would back up the discharge chute from the grinder resulting in unhappy sounds from the machine and unhappy time for me.De'Longhi uses an ""exclusive"" new technology / sensor to determine how much coffee to grind. I think the common method is to grind for a certain amount of time. This machine detects the actual amount ground - I think. Anyway, I think this sensor is located in the chute which can be accessed by popping up a small flap located right at the base of the bean hopper. Using the provided brush tool, and a thin plastic stick, I unclogged this chute and cleaned out as much coffee grounds as I could. Problem solved. But it did take about half a bag of beans before getting that resolved.I blame the above on the fact that this is our first semi-automatic machine. There is a learning curve.Now that the vulnerable part is identified and addressed, the machine has been working without any issues whatsoever. I am actually coffee-making, barista style, on this thing. Coffee tastes really really good. Unlike the Breville, this one has a built in tamper - handle on the left side of the machine in the product photos. Once you attach the portafilter, the machine will automatically grind the dosed amount of coffee. Pull the handle down to tamp - there's a mark to tell you how much to pull. Remove the portafilter, attach it to the brewing station and press OK button. And you have your coffee.The built in milk frother / steam wand works really well too. The frother has a dedicated heating unit, separate from the brew unity. It has a 'flat' and 'foam' function. I tried both and really enjoy the foamed steamed milk. After watching a few YouTube videos, I learned to hold the included frothing mug at a certain angle and move it in circular motion etc but then discovered that the machine does a really fine job without those shenanigans. Just set the mug on the corner of the drip tray, stick the want in there and turn the dial for steaming. You get a luxurious micro froth without doing the dance I described. And the steam stops automatically. If you like your coffee actually hot though, you will have to do the steam twice. There is a function to increase the temperature of the coffee but I have not played with that setting so far.The cons are very few. Coming from a fully automatic machine, I had a to learn to use a semi-automatic one but that should be expected of any new tool / machine. The machine is full enclosed and does NOT have the easily removable brew unit that some manufacturers highlight, including DeLonghi. That might be an issue further down the road, but DeLonghi Magnifica and Breville don't have that feature as well and don't seem to be suffering as a result.Overall, I am really pleased with the machine. Great build quality, great coffee. Happy with the purchase.",16 people found this helpful,Yes

EASY FIX! I am sharing this to avoid returns and waits. I called De'longhi and they were absolutely no help! They actually told me to just take the tank off after each use to prevent leakage!!! Um no, that doesn't fix the problem people!!  So I was ready to return the unit but decided to check things out on my own. Here was my discovery...On the back of the machine under the water tank (take tank off) there is a clear star shaped gasket that regulates the flow of water into the machine.  Gently rock the valve with your finger until you feel it lay flat. Do this even if it appears to be flat already. It seems to reset the flow. Fixed my problem! I think it is caused my pressure build up? Hope this helps others with leaking issues.We have been using this now for two weeks. LOVE IT! As a former barista I would highly recommend this machine as it is pretty self explanatory. A few things we didn’t like of the top was the awkward placement of the water tank. It’s a bit difficult to put water in from a pitcher or jug. Recommend using a tumbler or a glass if it’s stored under cabinets. Another issue we had with the unboxing was we couldn’t get the grinder to operate. That was due to not twisting the dome on hard enough ( I was afraid of breaking the plastic) but it’s tougher than one would expect. The frother wand should be dissembled and cleaned after each use or fill a cup with water and run the air through to make sure the inner nipple is clean. No water leakage as others have mentioned in their comments. All and all we are very happy with our purchase. Brews a great espresso and americano. The more you use it the more comfortable you will become with the functions. I highly recommend buying the knock box and espresso shot glasses!",10 people found this helpful,Yes

We haven’t had any of the maintenance problems other users have had. I haven’t seen any reviews here from an “unwilling” household member, so I wanted to post this. We have had the same automatic drip coffee maker for over 10 years, so this was a serious upgrade for us. As a guy who “just wants a cup of coffee” in the morning, I was very skeptical that I could grow to love this machine. We have limited counter space and so didn’t want to have both. But my wife promised she’d make the coffee every morning, so I consented. Her promise lasted about two months, so indeed I was stuck using the machine as expected (and making hers as well)! Now I drink cappuccino every morning, because the taste is better than coffee (Americano) and it takes the same amount of time. That’s my chief complaint with this machine, the active time spent using it. You can't set it to be ready when you wake up, and the operation is active; you can't just push a button and walk away. So my experience is not in comparison to any other espresso maker, but compared to a “normal coffee maker.”I also wanted to share a few tips to getting the time down from 8 minutes to 4 minutes including clean up. This is for people who have been using the machine for a few months so you know what I’m talking about.1. Use the shelf of the machine for the milk foaming. If you use enough milk (we use heavy cream/almond milk), the steamer tube will reach into the milk while in the included steel “pitcher”. I have found no difference in milk/foam consistency if I stir the milk around or just let it sit. I use this time (usually takes 2 steam cycles) to empty out the grounds and clean up the filter holder.2. I use a small metal spoon to clean out the grounds from the filter rather than banging it, which has been faster and makes less of a mess. I’ve been doing this for the past 4 months and have not noticed any scrapes to the filter or filter cup. The sooner you do this after use the easier it is.3. We remove and rinse the filter after each use. This was very annoying for me as I have big fingers and it’s nearly impossible to grip the tiny rubber tab to pull the filter out. Then my wife showed me a trick: just use a small corner torn off from a paper towel to pull the tab. It gives you just enough grip to easily pull out the filter, and works every time.I clean the filter and cup while the milk is foaming and this has made coffee making into only a minor annoyance rather than the serious one it was before.My other complaint is the noise that the foamer makes. Surprisingly, the way that you orient/tilt the milk pitcher makes a big difference. Play around with it until the noise is reduced. I used to wake up the whole house with what I would call the “shrieking beasts of hell”, but now they have mostly been tamed.Overall, I’m happy with the purchase, but it took some getting used to.PS:  In case anyone is wondering, each steam cycle adds about 30ml of water to your beverage. I weighed the milk pitcher before and after steaming. Yes, I'm a nerd.",9 people found this helpful,Yes

Just did my second descaling, no problems.  Still very happy and my wife loves every cup I make for her (of course she does!).  No leakage, remember to keep the portafilter inserts clean!Original review: This is a nice looking machine, and after three weeks I cannot say it has any problems at all.  I dialed in the grind (set at 2 and about 5/8 of full dial setting) and used some 20 dollar Lavazza Blu/Oro beans, the coffee was amazing.  The crema is quite good, it would be better if the head was heated by water like others, but run a hot water preheat before you start brewing.  Try to warm the cup too, will hold the crema longer.  For the price, this is quite good.  The steam heater works well, if you put an inch and a half of milk in the provided pitcher, the sixty second steam cycle is sufficient, but use a thermometer anyway, it is best gage of readiness and they cost about 10 bucks with the clip.  I believe cleaning is most important thing about these machines, blow out the steam tube, clean the steam wand, disassemble it and wipe the rubber tube after you're done with it for the time of day.  Use filtered water, this is not a FAEMA or professional machine, it will help you keep the pump and piping cleaner longer.  Don't let coffee get stale in the hopper, just put what you need for a few days at most.  Clean between the two disks of the portafilter, and rinse it out too.One thing that happened once is that a suction developed in the water line, not sure but seems like a check or stop valve got cycled by an air bubble.  I stopped the cycle when the trouble lights appeared, lifted and reseated the tank, and it burped when I restarted the cycle.  D'longhi should look into that, it might be a reason others have had problems with the water-out lights coming on.All said, having this quality of espresso at home is a wonderful thing, beats starbucks by a long shot.  If you want flavorings look up Torani syrups, I bought some for an occasional twist when I want it.  I will update if I have any other news on my experiences with this machine.  I think it is a good purchase so far.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

I mainly make lattes and americanos with the occasional cappuccino. I think Starbucks drinks are just ok, not good or great.  I purchased this De'Longhi La Specialista to replace a Breville 870. The advertised La Specialista dimensions don't accurately indicate just how big this machine is. With the grinder hopper attached, the actual height is about 17.5 inches and with the poorly designed power cord attached the depth is 16 inches. Lots of counter space is needed. The design of the built in tamper and grinder chute make getting the correct grind and tamp more difficult than necessary due to not being able to see how much coffee is being dispensed and feeling the tamp pressure. This process is an important part of pulling a good espresso shot. Only pressurized filters are provided. Once the grind and tamp are set as best as possible the resulting shots are only mediocre. The pucks are a mess, often not releasing from the filter causing the filter to drop out of the portafilter into the knock box and the puck needing to be scooped out of the filter.  The water reservoir is hidden on the sides so the water level can only be seen from the back of the machine. The steam wand is actually comprised of two pieces and milk goes up into the tubes requiring both pieces be removed and cleaned after each use. This is an easy process but I question how well the wand will hold up over time with this daily removal. Beans must be removed from the hopper prior to removing the hopper as there is no closing mechanism to hold the beans in the hopper. These issues are unacceptable for a machine at this price point. Now the pros; this is a good looking machine and is quiet, the steam wand does work well, easily frothing milk, and the warm up time is very quick. This machine makes better coffee drinks than a drip or pod coffee maker but isn't as good as other options in this price range. I returned mine and purchased another 870.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

The setting of the grinder is not consistent and difficult to adjust, especially at the finest grind settings.2. The milk foamer (expander) does not make higher density foam that I was used to with the Breville (manual) steamer and it is too easy to bump the wand into its ""flat"" setting3. The portaflter is deep and not very wide so I have great difficulty emptying the used grounds into a ""bang box."" I have to use a tool every time; which is very messy.

Select your drink and hit OK.There are some great features that make it easy to create the full range of coffee shop drinks:* You can easily grind and brew 1 or 2 shots. Filters are provided for both sizes.* You can select espresso, Americano (espresso + hot water), or ""coffee"" (AKA a lungo), and the machine applies the correct amount of water and brewing time.* A separate button will provide hot water only, making this the easiest way to brew tea.* There is a wand that can froth or steam milk so you can make cappuccinos and lattes.I initially thought the coffee was not hot enough, but I checked the manual and found a setting to use a higher water temperature. There is also a bit of trial and error to set the grinder to get exactly the right ""dosage"" of grounds per shot, but once you have that dialed in, you don't have to worry about it again for a long time.In conclusion, this is a great machine and I'm so glad I bought it. I can think of very few purchases where I was just as excited to use the thing weeks after I got it, and this is one of them.PS. If you ever see ""Amazon Warehouse"" selling one at a deep discount, go for it. I got a $300 markdown because one corner of the shipping box was slightly dented. The machine itself was pristine!",One person found this helpful,Yes

Those 2 functions sold me and I ordered this machine and am so happy i did. I love looking at it and I have also did several demo videos for my friends and family members who I can't wait to serve up a fresh cup of espresso or coffee.

I think DeLonghi tried to compete with Breville all-in-one machine and this attempt failed. They tried to couple their EC680M cheap machine with a grinder and the grinder is terrible. First, you need to grind always to the finest setting, and it is not fine enough. The beverage is sour (underextracted). the grinder has only 6 settings (a joke? only 6?) and they are all useless, since you need to set it to 1. And the espresso is not good. They tried to fix this problem by replacing regular baskets with pressurized baskets (they are more forgiving), but it means it is NOT espresso. Pressurized = bad. The tamper is a joke.When you brew espresso, the gauge in front of the machine NEVER shows the optimal zone. Never! Watch some youtube videos, never. I saw just one video, where the zone shown was optimal, but the guy used much more beans, filling the basket well above the limit.Verdict: it is not just a machine that is not as good as the others. The whole design is flawed, the machine simply does not work. I got it as a gift to friends in Taipei, so I cannot ship from there and  return.$799 just wasted. DeLonghi, have conscience! Return money! And fire all the designers.Google, there is a video, where a guy in France found a solution. Forget the internal grinder, and buy a separate grinder, nonpressurized basket, tamper and distributor, and use only 1/2 of La Specialista. A shame.",One person found this helpful,Yes

I think I'll keep it close to me. :)Update:  Two weeks after setting this up and only a handful of coffees I started noticing that the countertop had water on it after use.  At first, I thought it was from cleaning up around the unit or it settling in.  Boy was I wrong.  This unit leaks a significant amount of water all the time, but its haphazard as to when.There is definitely a design flaw someplace. I notice it most after doing a couple of cups back to back, but it can also happen with a single cup.  I typically will froth some milk and then make a couple of cups of Americano to use with the milk.  If I stop the Americano short of the full cycle or stop the frothing after the machine warms up, I notice the water the most.  Typically right after shutting off the cycle is when water will come during out the left side.  I put a paper towel down to show it in the attached photo.  This photo was taken mid water dump.  By the time it finishes, the towel is completely wet.I contacted Delonghi and they said it was a bad batch of drip drays that didn't have the proper hole so they shipped me a replacement drip tray.  The whole process of reporting and getting the new drip tray took months thanks to the COVID situation, which I understand.  However; when the new drip tray arrived, the problem persisted.  Now they want me to ship the unit back to them, go without a coffee maker for perhaps months and then wait to get back a unit that hopefully works.  I suspect this is more a design flaw than a lemon so I don't have high expectations.  Why not send me a new unit and then see?Very disappointed in what I thought was a premium band.",One person found this helpful,Yes

If you make coffee by the pot the preparation of coffee using this machine  will change your whole routine, buying habits and time.

It has been a great piece of equipment. We installed a reverse osmosis unit under our sink to avoid using our local hard tap water ($200). If you have hard tap water use bottled or RO water to extend the life of the machine to avoid scale build up.

I know a few people who have machines and the grounds make a mess on the counter top. Purchased in August 2019 with three repairs so far so just not a very reliable product.The good: When it works it brews a really nice coffee with nice crema. The integrated grinder and tamper work well.The bad: It breaks quite frequently. The first two times it was under warranty so we got to send it back for free. The first break was a loss of pressure in the device when making a coffee. This decreased the volume output and removed the nice crema from the top. The second time we got a refurbished machine which lasted another six months. Broken thankfully just before the warranty period ended. Most recently the steamer has malfunctioned so instead of frothing milk it only heats the milk. The other major issue with the steamer is instead of a wand they give you a nozzle which lets you change the amount of air allowed to mix with the steam. Well milk gets up the nozzle and really requires taking it off daily and cleaning it. Consider that vs a wand where you only need to turn on the steam function and it clears the line from any milk.

I am, however, quite the Starbucks lover. I am married to an ex-barista who is quite the snob about drinking coffee at home. I am not as picky, but I know a good cup of coffee when I have one in front of me. I figured between the two of our tastes and experiences that we could provide a well-rounded review. Setup was fairly simple. After yelling at my husband to read the instructions for the fifth time, it got cleaned & put together in about 20 minutes. This machine does not include the water softener filter so if you deal with hard water, plan to buy one in addition to the price of this machine. We’ve made two drinks so far and both have been amazing. We’ve made an iced caramel macchiato and a vanilla latte. The flavor is strong and brewed just right. Even for me, with no experience working an espresso machine, it was easy enough to figure out. Prep, brew, & clean up time took a total of 6 minutes from whole beans in the grinder to finished grinds in the trash. To compare to how much you’re spending on coffee already, when broken into daily payments over a year, it ends up being about $2.05. Way less than a grande or vente Starbucks drink price and according to the hubs way better in taste! I spent maybe $15 on Starbucks coffee beans, more almond milk, and some caramel drizzle that will last me over a month. Although it’s a lump sum in the beginning, you will be glad you made the investment. This machine is well worth it.UPDATE ON 8-11-19:I’m updating my review to add a few very important notes that I have learned since I posted my original review:1. Any coffee beans are “espresso” beans. This is probably basic knowledge to some, but I didn’t know that! I spent a good 30 minutes in publix looking for “espresso” beans. Lol.. live & learn.2. Watch all the YouTube videos! Making the perfect shot of espresso takes practice. I went to Costco & bought a big bag of beans and made about twenty shots just trying to perfect my skill!3. Only put the beans in the grinder before you go to make a cup. It makes for a much fresher tasting espresso.4. If you’re going to be making lots of espresso, invest in a good set of espresso glasses. I originally was using a stainless steel shot glass I had and my finger tips about burned off! I ordered JoyJolt double walled espresso glasses (the 2 oz ones) on Amazon and they have been a lovey addition to my morning espresso routine.5. The machine will stop grinding depending on where you turn the knob. I have found for a single shot of espresso, turning the grinder knob to the center and just a tad to the left that it makes the perfect amount for a great shot of espresso.6. The closer the espresso glass is to where the espresso is coming out is important! It creates a thicker level of crema.That’s about all I can think of right now.

Buyer Beware!,"If you are considering getting this machine... read on so you have a sense of what to expect.  If you have already, I sincerely hope your experience is better than ours.We have had this machine for about a year and a half.  About 4 months ago, the grinder stopped working.  It took me 40 min to get a hold of some one @ DeLonghi to get a repair (neve rmind online, where they promise a reply within 2 business days and I did not get any reply for over a month!).They did honor the 2 year warranty and repaired it at no charge... except that it took weeks to even get the box/paper work to send it to them and a couple of weeks to get it back (the latter, honestly, I was ok with).We have had it back now for about a month... and this morning it stopped working... again!  Now the computer thinks the water tank is empty (it is not, and we have inserted/re-inserted the tank several times), and wants to run the set up program (which we have run 4-5 times already)... to no avail!I am incredibly frustrated!  This was not a cheap item.  This was $800 and I would have expected better quality and better customer service.  I am at a loss. I was hoping for a better experience.  Now, I am back to my trusty coffee pot on the stove... until I figure something out.Still here are some comments I have for you to consider about the machine itself.What I love...It is relatively easy to set up and use... almost foolproof!It heats up quicklyIt is quieter than othersLots of features to make different drinks easilyFoams milk like a dreamThe tamping feature is really cool!  It helps control the mess and keep things tidy!But...There are several design “flaws”  you should be aware of...It is a tall machine... we have it under the upper cabinets and to get it in and out we have to take off the coffee bean hopper lidI absolutely dislike the fact you cannot take the hopper off when it is full of beans.  So, you are “stuck” with whatever beans you put in.  Other machines I have had lock the beans in and you can remove the hopper and the beans if you desire to change the coffee... which we do!It has only 6 grinder settings... we have it set one notch above the finest grind setting and we still are not getting the intensity of flavor we were used to get with other machines.  I wish there were more grind settings.I hope this helps you make a more informed decision.",162 people found this helpful,Yes

The most popular high end machine for making espresso at home has been the Breville Barista Express.  But that machine has a high learning curve.  Just learning to choose the right grind size from the many available options or consistently tamping the grounds with the right amount of pressure takes a lot of practice (and wasted coffee).  Not to mention learning to use the steam wand properly for milk based drinks.  You can spend about 4 times as much as the Breville would cost you to buy a superautomatic machine that makes really good espresso, such as the various Jura models.  Or you could spend just a little more money than the Breville and buy a machine like this new De'Longhi La Specialista Prestigio espresso machine, which automates some of the steps that are hard to master but still allows you more control over the process than a superautomatic machine would.  This De'Longhi only offers 6 choices for grind size, but with the built in sensor grinding technology, you don't need to be as precise when dialing in the grid size as you would need to be with a less advanced machine.  But perhaps the most useful feature of this machine is the smart tamping feature, which takes care of using just the right amount of pressure to tamp the grounds so you don't need to worry about that.  So whether you are a beginner or an expert when it comes to making your own espresso, you will always get more consistent results with this machine.  The steam wand is improved over previous De'Longhi models, but it does take a while to master the skill of using it to make really good lattes and cappuccinos.  However, after a little practice it didn't take me long to get much better results than I have been able to get with any other espresso machine I have used.  Overall this is a very nice machine, and probably the best value in a home espresso machine for under $1,000 that you will find anywhere.",61 people found this helpful,No

I love making mochas and capuchinos, but I have such a hard time trying to frothing and texturizing the milk to the creamer consistency to make lattes. With the Breville this process was a breeze. I was about tho give up and return this De’Longhi to Amazon and get another Breville instead. I did find a technique were I’m able to get the cream with this one to make my lattes, unfortunately it has been a 50/50 right outcome.

My last was a Breville Oracle that finally died after 3 years.  In deciding what to replace it with I evaluated what I wanted to use it for.  For the last few years I only drink Americanos and to a lesser extent, Lattes.  So I wasn’t looking for an espresso machine to produce god shots for drinking straight espresso, but something more than good enough to produce excellent Americanos and Lattes.  The La Specialista met that quite well.It is easy to use and since I was well experienced with espresso making, dialing it in to produce great coffee was quick and easy.  From power on to ready to use is about a minute.  Then I do a blind shot to heat up the portafilter as a cold portafilter will negatively affect the espresso produced.  I leave the empty portafilter in the machine and use the Rinse button to get the preheat done.  Grinding works well as does the built in tamping with a side effect of not being as messy as using a separate grinder with a tamper often is.  One concern with the grinder is that to make good espresso the grind setting needs to be very close to the minimum grind size and over time, as the grinder burrs wear that will probably become an issue.  Fortunately DeLonghi sells a replacement upper burr for that very issue.Steaming excellent and nearly automatic for Lattes or Flat Whites, but I think it is a little weak for a cappuccino.  Cleaning of the steam wand is dead simple and since the wand is a no-burn type, cleaning off the outside is easy too.The various button combinations for changing some default settings work well and are well documented in the user manual.  The First Start pamphlet is excellent and well presented so getting the machines ready for that first use is really easy.",26 people found this helpful,Yes

The previous one was a Krupps fully automatic machine, made really good coffee but like all machines do at some point, it decided to die.There are quite a few machines in the $1200+ range and a few in the $600-1200 range, which is the price range I was looking at. I had short-listed to Gaggia vs Philips, leaning more towards Gaggia but reports of their poor customer service was disconcerting. Both of these are fully automatic. De'Longhi had the semi-automatic Magnifica but it didn't look pleasing aesthetically as far as matching the rest of my kitchen goes. Breville seemed a little too much work with manual tamping - as in, you actually take the tamper and press into the portafilter to tamp.Almost as I was finally ready to buy, I see this De'Longhi - la specialista. I have had this machine for about two weeks now.It is a semi-automatic machine. Its not a press-one-button-and-get-coffee machine, you will have to do some, a little, bit of work. Meaning, attach the portafilter to the grind unit and then the brew unit. Not a lot of work, and it actually feels good to be doing that!!Build quality is really really good. I am hard pressed to tell plastic from steel parts. Sides have the brushed steel look and chrome trims and I have no idea what is plastic. A very solid, well built machine. It looks really really good sitting on the counter, especially with that black 'dashboard' with the pressure gauge dominating the facade. The portafilter is solid and surprisingly heavy - you could easily use it for defense in case of burglary or something !! Same solid build is seen also in the included frothing mug and the filters, as well as the steel drip tray grill. Rest of the drip tray is plastic - the one place where plastic is obviously plastic.Power button turns it on of course - there's a master on/off switch in the back. Also in the back is a water reservoir which is surprisingly large.Attaching the portafilter to the grinder starts the grinding automatically. The machine will grind coffee for one or two shots if you press the 2x button.This is where my only frustration with the machine arose - frustration that has since been resolved. Start with factory default settings - fineness at 3 and amount of coffee dial at about 10 o'clock position. I was too impatient and started playing with the dials causing the machine to grind EXCESSIVE amounts of coffee and essentially malfunction. Ground coffee would back up the discharge chute from the grinder resulting in unhappy sounds from the machine and unhappy time for me.De'Longhi uses an ""exclusive"" new technology / sensor to determine how much coffee to grind. I think the common method is to grind for a certain amount of time. This machine detects the actual amount ground - I think. Anyway, I think this sensor is located in the chute which can be accessed by popping up a small flap located right at the base of the bean hopper. Using the provided brush tool, and a thin plastic stick, I unclogged this chute and cleaned out as much coffee grounds as I could. Problem solved. But it did take about half a bag of beans before getting that resolved.I blame the above on the fact that this is our first semi-automatic machine. There is a learning curve.Now that the vulnerable part is identified and addressed, the machine has been working without any issues whatsoever. I am actually coffee-making, barista style, on this thing. Coffee tastes really really good. Unlike the Breville, this one has a built in tamper - handle on the left side of the machine in the product photos. Once you attach the portafilter, the machine will automatically grind the dosed amount of coffee. Pull the handle down to tamp - there's a mark to tell you how much to pull. Remove the portafilter, attach it to the brewing station and press OK button. And you have your coffee.The built in milk frother / steam wand works really well too. The frother has a dedicated heating unit, separate from the brew unity. It has a 'flat' and 'foam' function. I tried both and really enjoy the foamed steamed milk. After watching a few YouTube videos, I learned to hold the included frothing mug at a certain angle and move it in circular motion etc but then discovered that the machine does a really fine job without those shenanigans. Just set the mug on the corner of the drip tray, stick the want in there and turn the dial for steaming. You get a luxurious micro froth without doing the dance I described. And the steam stops automatically. If you like your coffee actually hot though, you will have to do the steam twice. There is a function to increase the temperature of the coffee but I have not played with that setting so far.The cons are very few. Coming from a fully automatic machine, I had a to learn to use a semi-automatic one but that should be expected of any new tool / machine. The machine is full enclosed and does NOT have the easily removable brew unit that some manufacturers highlight, including DeLonghi. That might be an issue further down the road, but DeLonghi Magnifica and Breville don't have that feature as well and don't seem to be suffering as a result.Overall, I am really pleased with the machine. Great build quality, great coffee. Happy with the purchase.",16 people found this helpful,Yes

EASY FIX! I am sharing this to avoid returns and waits. I called De'longhi and they were absolutely no help! They actually told me to just take the tank off after each use to prevent leakage!!! Um no, that doesn't fix the problem people!!  So I was ready to return the unit but decided to check things out on my own. Here was my discovery...On the back of the machine under the water tank (take tank off) there is a clear star shaped gasket that regulates the flow of water into the machine.  Gently rock the valve with your finger until you feel it lay flat. Do this even if it appears to be flat already. It seems to reset the flow. Fixed my problem! I think it is caused my pressure build up? Hope this helps others with leaking issues.We have been using this now for two weeks. LOVE IT! As a former barista I would highly recommend this machine as it is pretty self explanatory. A few things we didn’t like of the top was the awkward placement of the water tank. It’s a bit difficult to put water in from a pitcher or jug. Recommend using a tumbler or a glass if it’s stored under cabinets. Another issue we had with the unboxing was we couldn’t get the grinder to operate. That was due to not twisting the dome on hard enough ( I was afraid of breaking the plastic) but it’s tougher than one would expect. The frother wand should be dissembled and cleaned after each use or fill a cup with water and run the air through to make sure the inner nipple is clean. No water leakage as others have mentioned in their comments. All and all we are very happy with our purchase. Brews a great espresso and americano. The more you use it the more comfortable you will become with the functions. I highly recommend buying the knock box and espresso shot glasses!",10 people found this helpful,Yes

We haven’t had any of the maintenance problems other users have had. I haven’t seen any reviews here from an “unwilling” household member, so I wanted to post this. We have had the same automatic drip coffee maker for over 10 years, so this was a serious upgrade for us. As a guy who “just wants a cup of coffee” in the morning, I was very skeptical that I could grow to love this machine. We have limited counter space and so didn’t want to have both. But my wife promised she’d make the coffee every morning, so I consented. Her promise lasted about two months, so indeed I was stuck using the machine as expected (and making hers as well)! Now I drink cappuccino every morning, because the taste is better than coffee (Americano) and it takes the same amount of time. That’s my chief complaint with this machine, the active time spent using it. You can't set it to be ready when you wake up, and the operation is active; you can't just push a button and walk away. So my experience is not in comparison to any other espresso maker, but compared to a “normal coffee maker.”I also wanted to share a few tips to getting the time down from 8 minutes to 4 minutes including clean up. This is for people who have been using the machine for a few months so you know what I’m talking about.1. Use the shelf of the machine for the milk foaming. If you use enough milk (we use heavy cream/almond milk), the steamer tube will reach into the milk while in the included steel “pitcher”. I have found no difference in milk/foam consistency if I stir the milk around or just let it sit. I use this time (usually takes 2 steam cycles) to empty out the grounds and clean up the filter holder.2. I use a small metal spoon to clean out the grounds from the filter rather than banging it, which has been faster and makes less of a mess. I’ve been doing this for the past 4 months and have not noticed any scrapes to the filter or filter cup. The sooner you do this after use the easier it is.3. We remove and rinse the filter after each use. This was very annoying for me as I have big fingers and it’s nearly impossible to grip the tiny rubber tab to pull the filter out. Then my wife showed me a trick: just use a small corner torn off from a paper towel to pull the tab. It gives you just enough grip to easily pull out the filter, and works every time.I clean the filter and cup while the milk is foaming and this has made coffee making into only a minor annoyance rather than the serious one it was before.My other complaint is the noise that the foamer makes. Surprisingly, the way that you orient/tilt the milk pitcher makes a big difference. Play around with it until the noise is reduced. I used to wake up the whole house with what I would call the “shrieking beasts of hell”, but now they have mostly been tamed.Overall, I’m happy with the purchase, but it took some getting used to.PS:  In case anyone is wondering, each steam cycle adds about 30ml of water to your beverage. I weighed the milk pitcher before and after steaming. Yes, I'm a nerd.",9 people found this helpful,Yes

Now I am on the inside looking out .Have a Breville Nespresso Creatista - it has been great - but i wanted to get back to using coffee beans instead of pods.  Nespresso makes the best pods, but $.80 to $1 each pod adds up quick when you need two at a time for strength. I tried the pods where you can used your own grounds, but those don’t produce as well.I roast my own beans and love to experiment with different roasts and coffee beans (honey, pea-berry, wood fire roasted, ....)  which using pods I wasn’t getting to do.I was going to go with Breville Barista, I was waiting for a deal that wasn’t a scam.  And then this machine came along.  After research and comparison videos , it seemed better - due to the built in tamping arm and advanced milk frothing feature. Being a cappuccino man - the froth is important. Would be great if it had the temperature sensor of the Breville creaista - but a digital thermometer will do as work around.Got it all unboxed, cleaned, and produced  a cappuccino within 30 mins, using quick start. Took another 30 mins and read the manual and made a second cappuccino. Suggest reading manual as it has the info on how to change defaults and that you need to do multiple rinses not just one.Get a digital thermometer and a tamp box to go with it.Hope yours gets delivered before 7pm as you maybe wired until late in the night - with the caffeine from the test runs.",4 people found this helpful,Yes

Sep 28, 2019 I just unboxed my Specialista and I am without words. Its heavy. Its steel. Its gorgeous. I mean I read reviews and did my homework on a machine for I don't even know how long. I was set for a long time on the Breville Barista Express for look and price until I fond the DeLonghi La Specialista it all changed and I even coughed up an extra $100 ($599). Reviews were off the charts and espresso results were consistent and inspiring. So simple to set up but hard to keep clean. Every fingerprint is see so you will be constantly wiping it down to keep your baby smiling all day lol.Today 9/29/19 I am going to try to make my first Iced Espresso. I was playing with features and the hot water feature heats it up almost to commercial grade. My biggest thing from making coffee at home is that it doesn't get as hot during the brewing cycle. Already before I even pulled my first shot the water itself was scolding. Ok so my first espresso shot was an absolute fun disaster. OMG you are gonna have fun but waste alot of coffee so don't even think about splurging on an expensive bag keep 2 things in mind: 1) espresso is coffee but supposedly roasted longer and 2) it takes time to perfect the complex nature of expresso or exotic coffees that use other technique that regular brewing lacks.I will be back with an update after I have had a little more experience and see how this machine holds up.*******Update 10/25/19*********This machine is so much fun and delivers cafe quality espresso drinks. Made my first iced caramel latte that I usually pay over $4 for and mine tasted just as good. Super fun and I feel like a barista a few times a week and definitely on weekends. Hard to keep shiny stainless steel clean and it’s not really built to “wing” it on the fly. For example you can skip the built in tamper function if you want to press your own coffee which I want to do sometimes. The tamper light will flash but you can still move through the process. Also don’t try to steam your milk and drip your espresso doesn’t like that. I think it lost pressure I was worried for a minute. Otherwise it outperforms my expectations and a real conversation starter. It just looks so much better than the Breville.",One person found this helpful,Yes

There were a few disappointments from the start, but we most likely would have accepted them, but when it started to leak all over my counter top, we returned it. We checked it over and made sure that the seal from the water dispenser was making contact, but it still leaked. Now for the disappointments. Although we had the grind value down to the very lowest, we could not get the pressure gauge to read in the acceptable area. The taste wasn't bad tho and the crema was pretty good. It was also good at making an Americano which my husband likes. One thing that really bugged me was the the milk steam only runs for one minute and then quits. The only way I could get the temperature up to 140 was by resetting the steam. It did froth well, but I never did get a hot latte.  The automatic tamper worked so well that it was almost impossible to get the used grinds out of it. Forget using the Knock Box. Also the cup warming feature is useless.

Here's why, or at least here's what happened to me. Within two months of getting this very nice, very expensive machine, the grinder stopped working. I tried to get a replacement from DeLonghi, but DeLonghi doesn't recognize this seller as an official retailer so they wouldn't honor my request for a replacement piece. The seller would replace or refund if I would mail them the machine back, which would have been super expensive. The machine is obviously heavy. At the time, I chose to live with the machine since it was still half working. Today, the entire machine stopped working. It turns on but won't do anything else. All of its functions have ceased to work. So, DeLonghi machines, no matter who you buy them from, are lemons. At least mine is. DeLonghi, the company, won't stand by their manufacturing. The seller here would not make refunds or replacements realistic and absolutely not easy. Amazon is at fault here too, in my opinion. They should not let unauthorized sellers sell anything that would jeopardize a return,  refund, or warranty. At all. Ever. That's just shady. I hope you find a great espresso machine from a reputable company.  My DeLonghi was great while it lasted but I'd never spend a dime on something that didn't even last 10 months. Good luck. UPDATE: One day after posting this review, I was contacted by DeLonghi and was told that they would indeed honor the warranty.  They provided me with a packing box and packing slip (at their expense) to ship my broken machine off to be repaired. Which it was!!! The machine was repaired and returned to me. I love my machine and the coffees it makes. I kinda wish they would have honored the warranty the first go-round, but at the end of the day, I am glad DeLonghi did the right thing.",N/A,Yes

Just did my second descaling, no problems.  Still very happy and my wife loves every cup I make for her (of course she does!).  No leakage, remember to keep the portafilter inserts clean!Original review: This is a nice looking machine, and after three weeks I cannot say it has any problems at all.  I dialed in the grind (set at 2 and about 5/8 of full dial setting) and used some 20 dollar Lavazza Blu/Oro beans, the coffee was amazing.  The crema is quite good, it would be better if the head was heated by water like others, but run a hot water preheat before you start brewing.  Try to warm the cup too, will hold the crema longer.  For the price, this is quite good.  The steam heater works well, if you put an inch and a half of milk in the provided pitcher, the sixty second steam cycle is sufficient, but use a thermometer anyway, it is best gage of readiness and they cost about 10 bucks with the clip.  I believe cleaning is most important thing about these machines, blow out the steam tube, clean the steam wand, disassemble it and wipe the rubber tube after you're done with it for the time of day.  Use filtered water, this is not a FAEMA or professional machine, it will help you keep the pump and piping cleaner longer.  Don't let coffee get stale in the hopper, just put what you need for a few days at most.  Clean between the two disks of the portafilter, and rinse it out too.One thing that happened once is that a suction developed in the water line, not sure but seems like a check or stop valve got cycled by an air bubble.  I stopped the cycle when the trouble lights appeared, lifted and reseated the tank, and it burped when I restarted the cycle.  D'longhi should look into that, it might be a reason others have had problems with the water-out lights coming on.All said, having this quality of espresso at home is a wonderful thing, beats starbucks by a long shot.  If you want flavorings look up Torani syrups, I bought some for an occasional twist when I want it.  I will update if I have any other news on my experiences with this machine.

I mainly make lattes and americanos with the occasional cappuccino. I think Starbucks drinks are just ok, not good or great.  I purchased this De'Longhi La Specialista to replace a Breville 870. The advertised La Specialista dimensions don't accurately indicate just how big this machine is. With the grinder hopper attached, the actual height is about 17.5 inches and with the poorly designed power cord attached the depth is 16 inches. Lots of counter space is needed. The design of the built in tamper and grinder chute make getting the correct grind and tamp more difficult than necessary due to not being able to see how much coffee is being dispensed and feeling the tamp pressure. This process is an important part of pulling a good espresso shot. Only pressurized filters are provided. Once the grind and tamp are set as best as possible the resulting shots are only mediocre. The pucks are a mess, often not releasing from the filter causing the filter to drop out of the portafilter into the knock box and the puck needing to be scooped out of the filter.  The water reservoir is hidden on the sides so the water level can only be seen from the back of the machine. The steam wand is actually comprised of two pieces and milk goes up into the tubes requiring both pieces be removed and cleaned after each use. This is an easy process but I question how well the wand will hold up over time with this daily removal. Beans must be removed from the hopper prior to removing the hopper as there is no closing mechanism to hold the beans in the hopper. These issues are unacceptable for a machine at this price point. Now the pros; this is a good looking machine and is quiet, the steam wand does work well, easily frothing milk, and the warm up time is very quick. This machine makes better coffee drinks than a drip or pod coffee maker but isn't as good as other options in this price range. I returned mine and purchased another 870.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

The Specialista is attractive and seems well-made. However, I am disappointed in the Specialista in several ways and regret buying it instead of having my Breville fixed:1. The setting of the grinder is not consistent and difficult to adjust, especially at the finest grind settings.2. The milk foamer (expander) does not make higher density foam that I was used to with the Breville (manual) steamer and it is too easy to bump the wand into its ""flat"" setting3. The portaflter is deep and not very wide so I have great difficulty emptying the used grounds into a ""bang box."" I have to use a tool every time; which is very messy.

When I ordered this product in February of this year, I thought I knew quite a bit about coffee. I had experimented with several different coffee making devices but here was a product that made actual espresso, that ground the coffee to the correct size, preheated the water to the correct temperature, forced the water through the specialized portafilter at the appropriate pressure to insure proper extraction to make  delicious, coffee house style espresso. What’s not to love?Namely, the descaling process. We have had this unit for about 3.25 months and have descaled it twice. Descaling is a process that removes hard water mineral build up from the sensitive components inside the espresso maker. Our neighbor has this same unit and has had it for several months and has not yet been required to descale it.  We use filtered water only in our unit so I am not entirely sure what’s causing the issue.Other than that, we love our espresso maker.

I ended up choosing this over a similar Breville machine because of the additional hot water spout. I was initially apprehensive about the price, but now I don't know how I waited so long to get one of these. The only problem now is that I want to drink coffee all day!The machine is super easy to use, yet it's fun to operate and you feel like a professional barista. You get your coffee as fast as you would from a pod machine, but it tastes like you got it at a coffee shop. Once the machine is set up (not difficult), brewing a coffee is as simple as:1. Attach the filter to the grinder. The correct amount of beans will grind automatically.2. Tamp the grounds with the lever.3. Attach the filter to the brewer and place a cup underneath.4. Select your drink and hit OK.There are some great features that make it easy to create the full range of coffee shop drinks:* You can easily grind and brew 1 or 2 shots. Filters are provided for both sizes.* You can select espresso, Americano (espresso + hot water), or ""coffee"" (AKA a lungo), and the machine applies the correct amount of water and brewing time.* A separate button will provide hot water only, making this the easiest way to brew tea.* There is a wand that can froth or steam milk so you can make cappuccinos and lattes.I initially thought the coffee was not hot enough, but I checked the manual and found a setting to use a higher water temperature. There is also a bit of trial and error to set the grinder to get exactly the right ""dosage"" of grounds per shot, but once you have that dialed in, you don't have to worry about it again for a long time.In conclusion, this is a great machine and I'm so glad I bought it. I can think of very few purchases where I was just as excited to use the thing weeks after I got it, and this is one of them.PS. If you ever see ""Amazon Warehouse"" selling one at a deep discount, go for it. I got a $300 markdown because one corner of the shipping box was slightly dented.

I think DeLonghi tried to compete with Breville all-in-one machine and this attempt failed. They tried to couple their EC680M cheap machine with a grinder and the grinder is terrible. First, you need to grind always to the finest setting, and it is not fine enough. The beverage is sour (underextracted). the grinder has only 6 settings (a joke? only 6?) and they are all useless, since you need to set it to 1. And the espresso is not good. They tried to fix this problem by replacing regular baskets with pressurized baskets (they are more forgiving), but it means it is NOT espresso. Pressurized = bad. The tamper is a joke.When you brew espresso, the gauge in front of the machine NEVER shows the optimal zone. Never! Watch some youtube videos, never. I saw just one video, where the zone shown was optimal, but the guy used much more beans, filling the basket well above the limit.Verdict: it is not just a machine that is not as good as the others. The whole design is flawed, the machine simply does not work. I got it as a gift to friends in Taipei, so I cannot ship from there and  return.$799 just wasted. DeLonghi, have conscience! Return money! And fire all the designers.Google, there is a video, where a guy in France found a solution. Forget the internal grinder, and buy a separate grinder, nonpressurized basket, tamper and distributor, and use only 1/2 of La Specialista. A shame.",One person found this helpful,Yes

At first, I thought it was from cleaning up around the unit or it settling in.  Boy was I wrong.  This unit leaks a significant amount of water all the time, but its haphazard as to when.There is definitely a design flaw someplace. I notice it most after doing a couple of cups back to back, but it can also happen with a single cup.  I typically will froth some milk and then make a couple of cups of Americano to use with the milk.  If I stop the Americano short of the full cycle or stop the frothing after the machine warms up, I notice the water the most.  Typically right after shutting off the cycle is when water will come during out the left side.  I put a paper towel down to show it in the attached photo.  This photo was taken mid water dump.  By the time it finishes, the towel is completely wet.I contacted Delonghi and they said it was a bad batch of drip drays that didn't have the proper hole so they shipped me a replacement drip tray.  The whole process of reporting and getting the new drip tray took months thanks to the COVID situation, which I understand.  However; when the new drip tray arrived, the problem persisted.  Now they want me to ship the unit back to them, go without a coffee maker for perhaps months and then wait to get back a unit that hopefully works.  I suspect this is more a design flaw than a lemon so I don't have high expectations.

I called The manufacturer and they said there was a new tray design that fixed the problem and said they would send one out in two weeks. A month later we are still waiting for the replacement tray. Machine still works but we have to remove the drip tray to avoid the water tank from being drained into the drip tray.A good purchase from a good company that is slow like any big company....and it still feel like Paris.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

I know a few people who have machines and the grounds make a mess on the counter top. Purchased in August 2019 with three repairs so far so just not a very reliable product.The good: When it works it brews a really nice coffee with nice crema. The integrated grinder and tamper work well.The bad: It breaks quite frequently. The first two times it was under warranty so we got to send it back for free. The first break was a loss of pressure in the device when making a coffee. This decreased the volume output and removed the nice crema from the top. The second time we got a refurbished machine which lasted another six months. Broken thankfully just before the warranty period ended. Most recently the steamer has malfunctioned so instead of frothing milk it only heats the milk. The other major issue with the steamer is instead of a wand they give you a nozzle which lets you change the amount of air allowed to mix with the steam. Well milk gets up the nozzle and really requires taking it off daily and cleaning it. Consider that vs a wand where you only need to turn on the steam function and it clears the line from any milk. I have forgotten to on some days in a hurry and the next find curdled milk rising to the top of my coffee the next.,N/A,Yes

The only way I can get higher pressure is to fill portfilter to a level slightly higher than the horizontal line but, if you filled it too high you won’t be able to close it.- The Drip tray fills up very quickly and you need to remember to empty it or you will have water on your counter.  There is a rubber floater that is supposed to indicate high water level but it was not discussed in the manual.- The perforated screen inside the portfilter should be pulled out for cleaning but it is difficult  to remove.-  overall the machine is easy to use with all the indicators in the front panel.  It is nice that you don’t need separate grinder and tamper which saves a lot of counter space. Making Expresso is easy but  I am still working on my latte skills.  Sometimes I get a blob of foam on the top and other times I get no foams.A note after two months of use:  I am really happy with the purchase I made.  The expresso taste very good after I adjusted the water temperature to high and the double walled glass helps keep the drink hot longer.

Now I am on the inside looking out .Have a Breville Nespresso Creatista - it has been great - but i wanted to get back to using coffee beans instead of pods.  Nespresso makes the best pods, but $.80 to $1 each pod adds up quick when you need two at a time for strength. I tried the pods where you can used your own grounds, but those don’t produce as well.I roast my own beans and love to experiment with different roasts and coffee beans (honey, pea-berry, wood fire roasted, ....)  which using pods I wasn’t getting to do.I was going to go with Breville Barista, I was waiting for a deal that wasn’t a scam.  And then this machine came along.  After research and comparison videos , it seemed better - due to the built in tamping arm and advanced milk frothing feature. Being a cappuccino man - the froth is important. Would be great if it had the temperature sensor of the Breville creaista - but a digital thermometer will do as work around.Got it all unboxed, cleaned, and produced  a cappuccino within 30 mins, using quick start. Took another 30 mins and read the manual and made a second cappuccino. Suggest reading manual as it has the info on how to change defaults and that you need to do multiple rinses not just one.Get a digital thermometer and a tamp box to go with it.Hope yours gets delivered before 7pm as you maybe wired until late in the night - with the caffeine from the test runs.",4 people found this helpful,Yes

Sep 28, 2019 I just unboxed my Specialista and I am without words. Its heavy. Its steel. Its gorgeous. I mean I read reviews and did my homework on a machine for I don't even know how long. I was set for a long time on the Breville Barista Express for look and price until I fond the DeLonghi La Specialista it all changed and I even coughed up an extra $100 ($599). Reviews were off the charts and espresso results were consistent and inspiring. So simple to set up but hard to keep clean. Every fingerprint is see so you will be constantly wiping it down to keep your baby smiling all day lol.Today 9/29/19 I am going to try to make my first Iced Espresso. I was playing with features and the hot water feature heats it up almost to commercial grade. My biggest thing from making coffee at home is that it doesn't get as hot during the brewing cycle. Already before I even pulled my first shot the water itself was scolding. Ok so my first espresso shot was an absolute fun disaster. OMG you are gonna have fun but waste alot of coffee so don't even think about splurging on an expensive bag keep 2 things in mind: 1) espresso is coffee but supposedly roasted longer and 2) it takes time to perfect the complex nature of expresso or exotic coffees that use other technique that regular brewing lacks.I will be back with an update after I have had a little more experience and see how this machine holds up.*******Update 10/25/19*********This machine is so much fun and delivers cafe quality espresso drinks. Made my first iced caramel latte that I usually pay over $4 for and mine tasted just as good. Super fun and I feel like a barista a few times a week and definitely on weekends. Hard to keep shiny stainless steel clean and it’s not really built to “wing” it on the fly. For example you can skip the built in tamper function if you want to press your own coffee which I want to do sometimes. The tamper light will flash but you can still move through the process. Also don’t try to steam your milk and drip your espresso doesn’t like that. I think it lost pressure I was worried for a minute. Otherwise it outperforms my expectations and a real conversation starter. It just looks so much better than the Breville.",One person found this helpful,Yes

Although we had the grind value down to the very lowest, we could not get the pressure gauge to read in the acceptable area. The taste wasn't bad tho and the crema was pretty good. It was also good at making an Americano which my husband likes. One thing that really bugged me was the the milk steam only runs for one minute and then quits. The only way I could get the temperature up to 140 was by resetting the steam. It did froth well, but I never did get a hot latte.  The automatic tamper worked so well that it was almost impossible to get the used grinds out of it. Forget using the Knock Box. Also the cup warming feature is useless.

Great machine.  A tad smaller footprint than I expected, but solid and well made.  Stainless exterior. Relatively easy to use (my first foray into this type of machine).  A lot of online videos really simplifies the learning.  Saw videos comparing this to the ""B"" brand.  I would still buy this.  For me, there are enough settings on here to really personalize the drinking experience, yet enough built-in/automatic settings so one does not need to became an expert barista.  For the math addicts, netting out coffee bean purchases against not buying k-cups, this machine will pay for itself (for me) in less than two (2) years.

Here's why, or at least here's what happened to me. Within two months of getting this very nice, very expensive machine, the grinder stopped working. I tried to get a replacement from DeLonghi, but DeLonghi doesn't recognize this seller as an official retailer so they wouldn't honor my request for a replacement piece. The seller would replace or refund if I would mail them the machine back, which would have been super expensive. The machine is obviously heavy. At the time, I chose to live with the machine since it was still half working. Today, the entire machine stopped working. It turns on but won't do anything else. All of its functions have ceased to work. So, DeLonghi machines, no matter who you buy them from, are lemons. At least mine is. DeLonghi, the company, won't stand by their manufacturing. The seller here would not make refunds or replacements realistic and absolutely not easy. Amazon is at fault here too, in my opinion. They should not let unauthorized sellers sell anything that would jeopardize a return,  refund, or warranty. At all. Ever. That's just shady. I hope you find a great espresso machine from a reputable company.  My DeLonghi was great while it lasted but I'd never spend a dime on something that didn't even last 10 months. Good luck. UPDATE: One day after posting this review, I was contacted by DeLonghi and was told that they would indeed honor the warranty.  They provided me with a packing box and packing slip (at their expense) to ship my broken machine off to be repaired. Which it was!!! The machine was repaired and returned to me. I love my machine and the coffees it makes. I kinda wish they would have honored the warranty the first go-round, but at the end of the day, I am glad DeLonghi did the right thing.",N/A,Yes

I now realize that the machine looks amazing on the outside but the manufacturing and engineering quality of the components inside is poor. So if you are willing to spend $700 for a great espresso machine be prepared to spend a lot more regularly to keep it running.

The only way I can get higher pressure is to fill portfilter to a level slightly higher than the horizontal line but, if you filled it too high you won’t be able to close it.- The Drip tray fills up very quickly and you need to remember to empty it or you will have water on your counter.  There is a rubber floater that is supposed to indicate high water level but it was not discussed in the manual.- The perforated screen inside the portfilter should be pulled out for cleaning but it is difficult  to remove.-  overall the machine is easy to use with all the indicators in the front panel.  It is nice that you don’t need separate grinder and tamper which saves a lot of counter space. Making Expresso is easy but  I am still working on my latte skills.  Sometimes I get a blob of foam on the top and other times I get no foams.A note after two months of use:  I am really happy with the purchase I made.  The expresso taste very good after I adjusted the water temperature to high and the double walled glass helps keep the drink hot longer.

I could not be happier with this purchase, I had read a review that said to make sure and buy to go cups, lids, straws, flavors, milk, and I went one more step and got clear glass espresso cups that are perfect to see your beautiful finished delicious espresso. I like white chocolate powder as well as syrup so I bought both. Everything arrived on the same day so I was making my espresso in less than 30 min of its arrival. I LOVE this machine.",N/A,Yes

Terrible customer service.,Bought my Specialista in September 2019. The grinder is not meant for deep cleaning like the Breville does. And by deep cleaning I mean the removal of the lower burr to allow cleaning of deposits below it and dislodge and remove deposits upstream of the chute. The Breville lower burr has a nut so the lower burr removal is simple and easy. Di’ Longhi customer service is awful to say the least. I’m a 1 cup a day user.

I now realize that the machine looks amazing on the outside but the manufacturing and engineering quality of the components inside is poor. So if you are willing to spend $700 for a great espresso machine be prepared to spend a lot more regularly to keep it running.

What is easy about this machine is that there is no mess or muss w the grinds spilling out, or wondering if i'm tamping with the adequate pressure or if i'm tamping at an angle, etc... since most of those variables are accounted for and taken out of the picture with the automated grind/tamp system in this machine. I think this machine allows aspiring amateurs like myself to get a better espresso with control over a few variables such as general heat, broad grind size, and water amount, without having to be an expert at grind preparation and tamping, controlling pressure directly or having an exact PID temperature controller. Altho this machine has a secondary milk heating system, it is not a true dual boiler, since you can't froth and pull a shot at the same time. But the delay is a bit shorter between shot and milk heat up with this machine. The plus with the ease of using this machine is that even my espresso-machine-phobic husband was willing to move the portafilter from the grind area to the group head and press the ""ok"" button to get a shot.The pics show me using the single shot (they provide the non-pressurized only) basket, and dark roasted (big box store) Guatemalan Arabica beans on the ""2"" fine grind level w a dosage dialed to the line in the tamped filter, and a 2 ""bar"" out of 3 heat setting.  I tried to use the instruction manual's suggested 1 bar heat setting and a ""5"" grind coarseness for dark roast coffees originally, but this gave me a weak and runny espresso.Although not shown, i also used a timer scale for a few pulls, just to check out what I was getting out. What I'm finding is that, at least with the beans I'm currently using, I can fit about 13g of coffee in the basket, and i'm getting about 35 g espresso out in a fast 12 seconds, w the pressure guage going to about the 11 o'clock region at the height. I tried to slow this down by using more coffee and a finer grind, but that did not work as well (basket got stuck, espresso did not taste as good)....so, i'm kinda wondering if i'm doing something wrong, but, ""2"" grind level as is, and 12 seconds tastes pretty good. i'll mess around with this more when i get to a different bean. I recently had also read about ""turbo"" shots that provide better extraction at relatively coarser grinds and faster speeds - such as my 12 sec, at a 1:2 or 1:3 grinds to espresso ratio being ideal for extraction, but that's a whole other controversy apparently. All I can say is that my espresso through this machine at the settings noted is flavorful, not bitter, bright tasting and yummy in general.I am having a big learning curve with the 3 hole milk frother wand tho, and it's been kinda challenging in comparison to the 1 hole wand i'm used to. Still, I made a decent looking froth at least for the pics shown.Overall, I'm liking this machine because I have some control of my espresso results, but my  non-caring-about-making-espresso-just-wanna-drink-it-now-can-u-just-make-it-for-me husband can pretty much make one too.  The resulting espresso is really tasty, and ultimately, that's what an espresso machine is for, i figure.",10 people found this helpful,No

It just upped the class of the whole room. My poor fridge has already developed an inferiority complex, and let's not even talk about my cheap drip coffeemaker!The machine was packaged really well in the large box. I was glad two of us were there to pull the lighter-weight box out of the heavyweight box, because it fit so snugly. I was also glad two of us were there to pull the styrofoam-encased machine out, and I was glad one of us (not me) was strong enough to feel confident taking it out and placing it on the countertop. This thing is quite heavy, because it's made out of lots of metal components that, from what I can tell, are high quality.While the espresso maker would fit underneath my cabinets, I wouldn't be able to fill the bean hopper there. We'll keep it where it is now, near the edge of the countertop. If I need that space, I could move it underneath the cabinet when I'm not filling the bean hopper, but like I said, it's heavy. You could scoot it, but do you want to?This is my first espresso maker, so I honestly didn't know what I was doing. The Quick Start Guide is slick and would probably work pretty well for someone who has used espresso makers before. However, I was glad to see that De'Longhi has a YouTube channel. It has plenty of good videos on it. Just search ""De'Longhi La Specialista"" (plus any additional search terms like ""latte"" or ""cleaning."") Look for the videos put out by ""De'Longhi How-To."" So far, I've found these videos to be helpful:-Setting up La Specialista for the first time-Making espresso for the first time-Making a Caffe Latte-Regular cleaning procedures of La SpecialistaI really wish the item had come with a full instruction manual. I like to have actual paper to flip through when I'm figuring out a new machine! I found the full instruction manual on De'Longhi's website. It was about 20 pages long, so I printed it out. Between that and the YouTube videos, I was in good shape.When I was setting up the machine, there was a red, bean-shaped, blinking light. I looked it up and realized I hadn't positioned the hopper correctly. The instruction manual helped me there. To properly position the hopper, place it in the machine (you'll be able to feel what position works), and twist to the left until it clicks. The lock icon on the hopper will line up with the arrow below. I wasn't twisting hard enough at first. (See photo for proper positioning.)Take the time to follow the instructions in the set-up video to prime your machine. Then take the time to follow the instructions in the espresso video to get your bean dosage and grind size correct. This all takes a while, but it's worth it! You'll probably end up wasting some grounds when you're getting the bean dosage correct. I saved mine in a plastic container to use in our regular drip coffeemaker later. By the way, to get enough grounds, I had to turn the dial for bean dosage further to the right than I expected; it's on the third mark.The cleaning video helped me. I hadn't realized the single and double filters (the ones that go inside the portafilter) each have a little part inside in the bottom that can be removed. If you look, you can see a little tab on the rubber gasket portion of the filter. Mine were placed in there so tightly, I had to use needle-nosed pliers to get that part off! It's supposed to be removed for cleaning. (See photo.) I hope that as I use it more, the part will loosen up a bit, but for now, I'm keeping pliers in the drawer below the machine.I LOVE the Smart Tamping lever! It's so easy to properly tamp down the grinds down! (See photo.)The accessories for this machine are generally heavy, which I love. The portafilter is heavy. The milk frothing jug is heavy. Even the water container feels like nice, thick plastic. The bean hopper feels lightweight, but it has a nice, metal lid.Clean-up will take some time, but there's no getting around that. It's really not too bad, and if you're making multiple drinks, you don't have to clean everything in between. (For instance, you can wait to clean the drip tray and milk steaming/frothing nozzle until you're done making drinks for your appreciative family and friends.)I made three tasty lattes, including one with almond milk, and my family members are already fans. I feel confident that, using this machine, I can make drinks rivaling the $5 ones I buy at Starbucks. I'm even going to try to learn to do some latte art, because why not?All in all, are there cheaper espresso makers out there? Absolutely. Many people, understandably, don't want to pay this much for a machine that makes coffee drinks. Having experienced the quality of this machine, I'm confident I'll enjoy the beverage-creation process more than I would with a more lightweight, budget-friendly machine. If you're getting an espresso maker because you want to save money instead of buying coffee shop drinks, you'll have to make a whole lot of drinks to break even on this machine! If you're getting an espresso maker because you enjoy the process of making your own drinks at home, and you put a high monetary value on quality and the pleasure of using well-made tools, this may be just the right choice for you.",16 people found this helpful,No

We have found it with this De’Longhi.  I have a Nespresso Innissa for quick espressos and a Barista-style espresso machine I got on Amazon, but the De’Longhi sails far above either of those machines.  And so it should at this price point, but I do believe this machine would be hard to beat in the sub-$1000 category of home espresso machines.  A fantastic feature that really makes a difference is the built-in tamper.  Tamping usually makes a mess on the counter but this machine with the pull of handle on the side does it before you remove the portafilter.  I got lucky to set the grind right the second time so that the coffee, once tamped, was right at the level line indicated to get a great brew.  I set my grind to #4 for my coffee beans and that seemed to work well also.  Another excellent feature of the De’Longhi is the pull down tray to place your cup(s) on.  Keeping your cup close to the drip also aids in getting the best crema on your espresso.  I ran a cup through both of my espresso machines using the same beans and you could really taste the difference the De’Longhi made.  The coffee (same coffee) actually tasted better!  I think it goes to show the technology in these higher-end machines and the superior extraction process.  I know this isn’t a cheap decision but if you are going up to that sub-$1000 price range, I don’t think you can beat this machine.  I will also add that it is just gorgeous looking in terms of design and really impresses on the kitchen countertop!",8 people found this helpful,No

My husband loves espresso, but orders from a local restaurant when he's in the mood and he is no barista.I'm a tea drinker, so yeah, what do I know. For the review I can tell you this, husband and visitor loved the results from the first shot. The beans ground in moments (just the right amount, automatically), the tamper is built in and tamps just right, the coffee brewed beautifully, and had the nice crema that apparently espresso drinkers appreciate for a silky touch.So I can't talk to the taste, but I can say that this is a well built machine and heavy, although there is some plastic involved. Still, it's a high quality appliance. The controls are self-explanatory (although reading the manual would be helpful for the uninitiated).This appliance will be much appreciated in our New England home by the visitors who are accustomed to a daily jolt or two of Cafe Cubano. We're ready.UPDATE Aug 13 2022: And on this day the grinder died. An hour spent cleaning the hopper and grinder parts and no luck. Downgraded to three stars and those remain because it really does make great coffee I'm told, and it still brews.But turns out it's a complicated process even for some people who know how to use an espresso maker, impossible for those who haven't without the instructions and no one bothers with instructions, they just barrel ahead.Be prepared to be the sole barista when guests arrive.FURTHER UPDATE: We sent it to an authorized repair company and they fixed it. From now on if someone wants an espresso they can wait until we prepare it for them.Still three stars. Five for the delicious coffee, so sayeth the coffee drinkers who have enjoyed a pour.",7 people found this helpful,No

I have machines and accessories for just about every way of preparing coffee, to include 3 espresso machines, and a stove top (Mokka).  For the past few years we have been using a Phillips Saeco machine.  It is very easy, and also very good, but it does consistently pour a little water into the cup before it dispenses coffee... so it is good, but less than ideal.Some years ago I read on Coffee Geek that your grinder can make as much of a difference as your machine/ method of preparation.  I went through half a dozen grinders before I found one which lasted for more than a month or two past warranty (and there were several expensive grinders from well known companies).  The machine which lasted, the one we still use 6 or 7 years later, is a De'Longhi.  I also have a toaster oven from De'Longhi in my garage.  We used it for over 20 years, replacing it only this year with an air fryer, but held onto the De'Longhi in case that gives out.  All that said, I know that De'Longhi makes solid equipment which performs well and is reliable.  In fact, I sent my son a De'Longhi espresso machine when he graduated from college and then got stranded in California, by the shut downs.  Sensibly the next machine I would look at would be a De'Longhi.This machine does take more effort than the one we had been using, but it is an all in one machine.  It has a conical burr grinder which dispenses into the portafilter.  There is also a built in tamper.  The portafilter is then moved to where the water is expressed.  You can adjust the coarseness/ fineness of the grind and the amount of coffee ground/ dispensed as well as the amount of water and temperature.  A chart is provided with suggestions based on the roast.  There are also options with respect to how much froth is produced.This machine provides a lot more control than the Saeco and the amount of water, speed, heat are determined based on grind and dose settings.  The end result was espresso which was much better than I have been able to make with the other machines I have had.While the machine is not automatic, everything you need is provided, with recommendations for getting the best from each type of roast, but you can choose the grind and amount based on personal preferences, and store some of those choices with the ""my"" button.",5 people found this helpful,No

It’s all stainless steel and is ready for decades of use because the stainless will look good for the life of the espresso machine without rusting away like other materials would have. And with all the other pieces and parts fitting perfectly well and made to last just like the stainless it can and will be passed on hopefully to another espresso lover just like myself. The instructions were informative and easy to read and understand and the pictures helped me immediately with setup and use. It grinds the beans to exacting specifications for this machines use. It does the tampering to required pressure as well with just a push of a button. I’m getting better and faster everyday in its use and with it doing most of the work for me with probably one hundred percent more accuracy than me. Each and every espresso I let it make for us is the perfect cup every time, all the time. It does get noticed immediately sitting on our counter the moment eyes set on it as it’s brilliant brightness and ultimate quality stands out against every other appliance we have. Definitely starts many a conversations. I’m fully satisfied with the quality of and the functionality it provides us daily. Update (24 December 2021) added a picture of the pressure dial getting into the optimal zone. Once dialed in we were rewarded with a great tasting five star experience!! Update (17 February 2022) We definitely are still enjoying the espresso machine and it’s ease of use but when it needs to be descaled everything comes to a screeching halt for 45 minutes. I turned it on this morning to prepare it for our drinks and we are just sitting around now waiting for it to descale. Maybe a switch so it’s not always need descaling at the critical time we need it the most. But still 5 stars. Five Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!! Update (March 7 2022) I stand corrected, as long as the knob is in any other position other than the descaling mode when the light comes on it will still continue to make espressos until AFTER the morning rush and can be descaled at our leisure later that day or night. We are still happy with the daily operation of the machine!!  Still 5 Stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!",5 people found this helpful,No

After using it 2 or 3 times a day for the past two weeks, I can say without any exaggeration that it looks and performs exactly like a professional espresso machine and has everything you need to make espresso drinks that taste *exactly* as good as the best coffee houses. Although I could write a full report detailing why I believe it is an outstanding machine, I'll limit this to a just-the-facts paragraph. First off, it is fast, and you can have a double-espresso latte made within 5 minutes of turning it on. It is also the cleanest real espresso machine that I've ever used; the grinder doesn't leave coffee grounds anywhere and any small amounts of powder from the tamper collect straight down into the drip tray. The tamper is connected to the tamping lever with a spring which ensures that you don't over- or under-tamp the basket. The brewing has a perfect amount of automation, by which I mean that you still have a good control of the coarseness of the grind and the brewing temperature. One thing that really stands out to me is that it has a gauge that gives you feedback on the brewing pressure which gives you direct feedback to use for adjusting the grind coarseness for the specific beans that you're using. Selecting between a single or double shot is as easy as pressing a button and switching between espresso, Americano, or single serving of regular coffee in just a turn of a knob. For the Americano, it even automatically adds the right amount of hot water. The steam wand is really impressive because the control knob activates a pump that pulses water into the steam chamber which eliminates having to drain the wand of condensate and also ensures that there is the right amount of steam pressure. I could easily go on about this machine but suffice it to say that it really is that impressive! Highly recommend!",4 people found this helpful,No

For the longest time I still couldn’t justify spending this much on a coffee machine, however I’m here to say that the D’longhi Specialista is worth every penny plus some. Aesthetically, this machine looks excellent on your countertops. Performance wise, this expresso machine is impressive and makes some of the best coffee you will ever have. The grinder on the top is great so that I don’t have to use my extra coffee grinder and the coffee is always super fresh. It portions out the exact amount needed for a cup of expresso based on your selection. It is a bit tricky to get the hang of initially, but the instructions are clear (plus their are videos online) and once you get the hang of it, it’s not complicated at all. It’s just going from a Keuirg to a fancy machine like this takes a bit of practice. I can make a double shot of expresso and foam/ steam my milk and no longer need to make a coffee run to get the coffee I desire. You can even pick the temperature that you want which is nice. Machine is tall, so if you have an older 1950’s home with shorter cabinets you will need to measure to be sure it fits under cabinet. We are not done renovating yet so cabinets are still short and I have to remove grinder accessory to push it so it sits flush under cabinet.Overall, I would highly recommend this. It is an expresso machine that you will get your money’s worth out of and the quality is top notch.",3 people found this helpful,No

One daughter works as a barista in a private high end coffee shop and is used to expensive equipment. That said...We all think this is a great machine.Everything about it feels and looks like quality, it is well designed, and it works well.Unboxing and setting it up was fairly simple.  As is typical (I guess) it took a few days of tweaking to fine tune it to our coffee preferences, but even the trial and error ""fails"" were drinkable.A big plus is the tamping. It is manually done... sort of. Well, it's foolproof. Hand tamping can be a learned skill (that I never quite mastered), but this doesn't require that. There is a lever on the side of the machine (like a slot machine) which is mechanically set to tamp to the right density. Works great, even when I do it!The milk frother is the real deal (though I'm not the big user), and works well. We (they) can make just about any coffee drink known to man now.There are also auto settings for americanos and regular coffees, but we really stick to the double espresso setting.Love it!

In those years I have repeatedly tried to get good at making espresso (my partner is the espresso maker in our house).  Every time, I give up.Part of that is because it feels too easy to make a mistake and part of that is because its a huge mess. Particularly getting the grounds from the grinder, and then temping them down. I know that probably sounds finicky and whiny to folks who really love their espresso but I hate it and it led to our counters never feeling clean.The fact that grinding and tamping is in the machine is infinitely better. It keeps our counters cleaner but it also means that when we get new beans, my partner can do all the fiddling to get the exact right grind and dose and then we just leave it that way for me to make my own drinks. Despite using this machine for over a month, I still don't know the principles behind getting the perfect pull, and I am totally okay with that. I am making more espresso drinks now than I ever did with the Gaggia. I don't know if purists find that annoying, but the added features make it a lot more user friendly. I am even pretty confident if my mom came to visit, I could show her how to do it once and then she could just make her own drinks.SIZEBecause the photo I took has the Gaggia in front of the De'Longhi it makes the Gaggia look a bit bigger than it actually is. It is definitely narrower, but a tiny bit taller. It used to live under our cabinet and had a fairly small footprint on the counter. The De'Longhi is more substantial and can't fit under the counter. If you took off the lid to the bean hopper, you could totally put it under the counter but that would leave the beans unprotected from the air and they would go stale. If your cabinets are a bit taller you might be okay but I think they are generally hung at a standard height. Because of that, we have it half under the cabinet with the hopper sticking out. There's only one real place in our kitchen that it fits that way, which is right next to the sink. While I think I'd prefer to have it on the left side of the sink which is impossible to do, this is okay - not ideal but okay.OVERALLIn the end, this is a nice compromise for my partner and I. He's super into making espresso and getting things as perfect as possible. I'm not interested in that at all, I just want good coffee. This is an excellent way for both of us to have what we want without me having to bug him for every drink. I also use the hot water function for tea every morning which means I can put my kettle in the cabinet. There is a way to change how much water comes out with the hot water function I believe but I haven't fiddled with it yet.",2 people found this helpful,No

Having said that, this machine is beautiful and looks very expensive (which, it is).  It does not have too many parts to keep track of so that's good, but it does have more bits then I'm used to having to maintain, so it is a bit of an adjustment for me.  Putting it together out of the box wasn't that bad.This draws a LOT of power.  I don't know too much about these things but I know it blew a breaker right away.  I had to move appliances around in my kitchen for sure.I watched the videos on You Tube on how to work this machine and was enjoying several lattes right right away (I wanted to practice).  What I'm not really understanding is how to get the espresso I'm making match the diagram of a ""perfect"" espresso.  According to the pictures, I'm ""over-extracting"".  I've followed the instructions on how to correct this but nothing I do seems to change the look of the espresso coming out of the machine.  I guess it's no big deal because whatever this is making is delicious and a billion times better then the coffee I was making before, and I'll watch more videos and try and figure it out.I don't love:You can't froth milk and make espresso at the same time.  I guess that makes sense but I wish you could.There is no clearance for a decent sized mug.  I know us Americans make giant coffees, but hey, this is being sold to Americans so please make it a little but taller.  You can't remove the grill to give more clearance and make the machine work.There isn't much clearance for the frothing wand and it doesn't really move that much.  I don't feel like I can froth that much milk at a time.So basically, my main complaints right now are that I want to make giant beverages and this machine forces me to have portion/quantity control, which all is a #firstworldproblem!",6 people found this helpful,No

It had a bit of a learning curve, though. So first… The unpacking itself was impressive. The packaging was done so well I barely could get the tightly packed machine out of the attractive and well-designed box.  The machine and its parts were packed within some seriously dense foam and the smaller parts were packed within a much smaller well-designed box within the main box.  The machine and parts were wrapped in a plastic wrap that ensured that even a small blemish could not occur during packaging or shipping.  The box contained all the parts necessary to make all types of one- and two-shot drinks: 2 espresso filters to make a single or a double espresso, descaling tablets, a stainless-steel milk pitcher, and a cleaning brush, and single-use descaling solution.My friend and I removed the parts from the box and we began the very small amount of assembly and setting the unit up on my countertop.  I decided to fill the bean hopper before I installed it onto the top of the machine.  I lay out a cloth and filled the hopper and once I started to move the hopper to the top of the machine, beans fell out of the bottom of the hopper onto the countertop.  Yes, the bean hopper has an open bottom.  That made us realize that you cannot remove the bean hopper while there are beans in it and it is installed on the top of the machine because they will spill out over the top of the machine and onto your counter and floor.  The bean hopper must be visibly empty to remove it from the top of the machine or you must vacuum the beans out of the hopper before removal from the machine or later vacuum the beans off the counters and floor.After that fiasco, I decided I might want to refer to the Quick Start Guide for the remaining setup items.  If in doubt, read the manual/quick start guide. The Quick Start Guide is helpful but in no way takes the place of the full manual.  My initial test results were poor.  But, after reading the full manual and still getting less than optimal results in grinding and brewing, I decided that the full manual does not take the place of the many YouTube videos available to help with settings and operation of the machine.  After reviewing several YouTube videos, I got to action, made some adjustments, and had much better results.I really like the integrated grinder with Sensor Grinding Technology which provides consistent grinding and the Smart Tamping Station perfect pressure tamper.  It took some looking at YouTube videos for me to understand the grinding operation and how to adjust the grind to get the optimal grind for crema but once I tinkered with it and did several test grinds and test shots of espresso, I better understood the adjustment needed to get the optimal shot and crema with the coffee beans I was using.  I believe it will be easy to adjust the grind to suit any other coffee bean I might choose in the future should I decide to change the brand and type of bean.  Understanding and using the tamping mechanism was a breeze.My favorite part of the machine is the Immediate Start function.  Yes, you can power the machine on and start grinding immediately.  While you are grinding, the machine is readying itself for the brewing, preparing hot water for Americano and/or milk frothing.  It uses two independent heating systems so there is no waiting time between the espresso and the milk preparation.  The Advanced Latte System is super easy to use and I was able to make the perfect foam the very first time I tried.  There are two options for milk – foam and flat.  The only downside is I wish the stainless-steel milk frothing pitcher were larger.  It only holds enough for a small latte.  I will definitely be purchasing a larger pitcher.The overflow tray offers a warning by use of a piece of floating plastic that sticks up through the tray as the tray fills.  By the time this happens, the tray is difficult to remove and balance to get it to the sink to empty.  Since it is easy to remove and check for fullness, I would suggest you remove it and rinse it before it gets to this level.  Some of the buttons function to give water for rinsing and steam for other parts of the machine for cleaning.Overall, the great design of this espresso maker makes this piece of equipment fancy up my countertop.  It’s just a gorgeous amalgam of stainless steel that looks luxurious and professional at the same time.I do think some things could be better.  For one, the milk steamer pitcher is small – very small – only 12 oz.  That may sound big enough but it only holds enough milk and foam for a half-full mug of latte.  But that is an easy to resolve issue by purchasing a larger pitcher.  The bean hopper should have some type of mechanism that would allow it to be removed without losing all of the beans.  I would think some type of an operable lever that could close off the hopper might be a plus.  I also think the height of the bean hopper can be a problem with top cabinets that are not abnormally high.  Mine are about 17-1/2”, pretty close to new Cabinet standards, and the hopper lid does not fit on the hopper and fit under my cabinet.  It’s just a little too tall. I am using a small piece of plastic to cover the hopper when it is under the cabinet.  This could be a major problem for some because many cabinets are much lower than mine.  Also, the low upper cabinet might get in the way of operating the tamper lever.  In addition, the drip tray could use an early warning system instead of a “too late” system to notify the user that it is full.  And, lastly even though the water fill chamber holds quite a bit of water and the machine seems efficient in its use of the water, I would appreciate it if the water fill chamber was on the side for easier filling and access.Since my machine has only been in use a couple of days, I have not yet descaled.  I’m certain I will provide lots of use and therefore opportunity to see if it continues to function well.  If not, the machine has a one-year parts and labor warranty. I will amend this review if I find any major flaws or if this espresso maker does not hold up as I think it will.

A few years ago, I started working from home, and I got in the habit of going to Starbucks every morning to have a few minutes of human interaction before returning to my home office. By early August, I realized I had spent over $900 year to date on coffee, decided it needed to stop, and picked up a Keurig. It saved me a ton of money, but it wasn't nearly as good as espresso drinks. Enter the DeLonghi!Size/Space: First thing's first - before you jump in and order one yourself, figure out if you have anywhere you can put it! The unit itself is about 16"" wide, 16"" deep (with power cord), and 17-1/2"" high. The height is a big one, because the standard clearance from kitchen countertops to cupboards is 18"" - however, if the kitchen has been remodeled, the counter tops may have been upgraded to a thicker surface than older materials - I found my cupboards were only 17-1/4 to 17-1/2"" above the countertops, and it wasn't possible to slide this under the cupboards, so I had to find a new home. Now, even if you DID put it under the cupboards, you may find that you don't have sufficient access to remove the water reservoir on the back or access the bean hopper on top without pulling the unit out, which can be a little bit challenging in its own right. Height issues aside, you should be aware of the width - it's about 16"" wide total, but you can't sandwich this right up against a wall - you need clearance on BOTH. I'd say you need about 3-4"" minimum on either side to operate the tamper (left) and the knob for the steam wand (right). Minimum, I'd say you need 20"" of space, or it needs to be next to items on the counter that are shorter than the knobs (I have mine on one edge of the counter, and a knife block next to the machine that is short enough to easily operate the knob and steam wand)Setup: Initially, it can be a little challenging to figure out how to use it, but after doing it once, it's easy. Fill the Reservoir in back (filtered water recommended), Fill the bean hopper with your preferred espresso beans and turn the base of the hopper to the preferred grind setting (1-8, the guide that came with the machine suggested about a 4 for a medium roast which was a very good starting point). Turn the unit on with the Portafilter detached. The Portafilter has interchangeable single shot or double shot baskets - putting the basket in the first time is a little difficult because the springs are new, give it a good press/smack with your palm. Now, *IF* you're making a double shot, choose the ""x2"" button on the face of the machine first. Choose your extraction temperature on the face - it's indicated with 3 horizontal bars, and pressing the button cycles between 1, 2 and 3 bars - DeLonghi recommends 2 bars for Medium Roast beans. Finally, you'll have to adjust the ""dose"" (amount of ground beans) with a dial. You may need to waste some grind/beans the first time to get it right - start low and adjust the dose until, when tamped, the grind is even with the stamped ring inside the portafilter basket (adjusted for both single and double shot baskets)Daily use: Once you get that set up above dialed in, it's pretty easy - turn the machine on, insert the Portafilter - the machine will automatically grind the beans into the filter. Once the grind is finished, the machine will flash the tamping indicator to let you know to pull the arm to tamp the grind - just pull the arm to the indicated full pull line, and you're set. Remove the portafilter and insert it into the brew head, set your cup/mug under it, and press the ""Ok"" button (could have been called start). You'll have espresso within about 60 seconds of turning the machine on. I had a perfect shot the very first time I used the machine, and I was shocked. I worked at a Starbucks 25 years ago, and I vividly remember needing to adjust my tamping pressure a few times nearly every time I started a shift until I had it right. Now that I've been using this about 2 weeks, I continue to adjust a little, but I haven't yet had anything that resembled a *bad* shot - just ranging from good to perfect.Steaming: This is one area where I'm not thrilled with the machine. The dial on the right hand side of the machine has two settings - on or off. You turn the dial all the way until it clicks to start the steam, and then you click it off to stop, and starting the steam isn't instant - it builds pressure before releasing it. I would have preferred the knob work as an adjustable valve to control the flow. The other thing I don't love about the wand is that it is TOO vertical. 17.5° from vertical is as far as you can move it, so it's not as easy as I'd like to get a good vortex in the pitcher to incorporate the foam. I was able to adjust to this after a couple days, so if you get your technique down, it works fine. I think a small change to the wand would make this much nicer though.Side note: get yourself a clip-on dial thermometer for your pitcher for steaming milk. Using a thermometer will keep you from scorching your milk. They can be found, with clip, for as little as $9 - but it may be worth spending a few dollars more. This is a detail that I think DeLonghi is missing - it would be great if they included a clip with thermometer properly sized/fit for the included pitcher - the thermometer I bought is a bit long for my liking.Cleaning: This is perhaps the area that can be burdensome - I'm pretty much the only one drinking espresso in the house (unless my mother-in-law is visiting), so it can be a little time consuming to clean the Portafilter, Pitcher, and Steam Wand every morning after making myself a latté - but all told, the process takes 5 minutes - less time than stopping in a coffee shop, and much less once you factor in time getting there and back.Final Verdict: While the size of this machine caused some early consternation, once I found a home for it, I quickly grew to enjoy it. Early on, I doubted that I'd use it daily, but there's only been one day since setting it up that I didn't use it - and that was only because I woke up to a colossal work disaster that left no time for even the smallest of luxuries. The quality of the espresso has far exceeded my expectations! As for time and convenience, a few years ago I dated someone with a Nespresso machine - and I don't think there's a whole lot of time savings in using the Nespresso versus using this to make proper espresso - using the Nespresso pods probably saves 1-2 minutes, and most of that is really in clean-up.",One person found this helpful,No

Seriously perfect. Like, I almost cry with the first sip every. single. time. I also love the bean hopper and how easy the tamping process is with this. There are many challenges, however, with the rest of the machine. The first being that it draws so much amperage, that it flips the circuit almost every time I use it. We live in a new custom home with a brand new electric system. From the street, to the box, to the wiring. I’ve never had a breaker trip. Even when using multiple large appliances at the same time. It’s a pain. Next disappointment is the steam/wand. It’s really lame. It doesn’t build much steam power and it “pulses” the steam. It takes forever to froth milk. The wand doesn’t have a big enough range of motion to hold a bigger size pitcher comfortably. I ended up purchasing a countertop milk frother that is <<chef’s kiss!>> But again, how stupid that I need an additional step. The last thing is the interface. It’s totally and needlessly complicated. Please just give me 2 shots of espresso, an option for hot water after my shots are pulled and froth the milk quickly and creamy. I don’t want 5 additional and irrelevant buttons and lights to blink at me every morning, pre-coffee. Overall, I think this machine is trying to do too much so it fails to do the 1 thing perfectly.

   This De'Longhi La Specialista Prestigio Espresso Machine is well made and a bit heavy because it is solid. The assembly is very minimal. There are two manuals and both must be referred to because the more colorful one doesn't have all the parts identified. Some of the better features include the filter holder assembly which has a long handle on it and locks into place and automatically initiates the grinding of the beans in the hopper. The big advantage is that when it locks into place, there is no place for ground coffee to fall out and make a mess. Also, the tamper is built in and the coffee is precisely tamped and since the tamping takes place with no place for the coffee to fall out, again there is no coffee ground mess. One can make either coffee or espresso with this machine.  In my pictures you can see one cup with coffee and the other with espresso.  The grind of the beans can be adjusted allowing for different strength and smoothness. The frothier can be set to specific settings so the cup does not have to be moved around to get the desired results. The espresso maker can be set to self clean with steaming hot water. Excess water runs down into the tray and a red plastic pieces floats up through the grill to show you when it is time to empty the water out of the tray. This machine gives professional results without having to have professional technique. This is the most user friendly espresso machine I have ever operated.",One person found this helpful,No

Parts of the machine are literally flimsy plastic. If you can see this from the outside, I can only imagine how much plastic is on the inside of this machine. The tamper is PLASTIC, the lid on the grinder is PLASTIC and the outside of the machine dents easily and is just plain CHEAP. It’s all a facade! After spending $800 on a machine you would think they can spring for materials that are more than aluminum and plastic!After 2 months of daily use (maybe 3 or 4 shots a day) it started leaking from the spout that goes into the drip tray. I would wake up to a puddle of water every morning. In addition... The water doesn’t get hot enough, the grinder is no where near the quality that it needs to be to make the kind of espresso that you think you are paying for. Bottom line is there is always something wrong with this machine and no one could ever figure out what it is with those cryptic symbols they have popping up!

Other coffee makers and espresso makers that we had were definitely not this pretty.While it is a beautiful machine it does not come without a learning curve, dont expect to press a button out of the box and have a delicious coffee.We have been using this for a few weeks now and it has taken a few tries to get our cup of the coffee the way we like it. It was slightly challenging but we have never had a machine like this either. You will need to learn the knobs and how they function with your preferences (espresso, americano etc). I think the hardest part was figuring out how many beans and how not to overfill the tamper. It takes less than a minute to make a delicious cup! You can also just dispense hot water which is super nice for a quick cup of tea.But once you get it down it is the best cup of coffee or espresso ever - like your own cafe! I know for my husband and I this will save us money in the long run.I do recommend buying quality beans and filtered water but chances are if you are considering this machine you would do that anyway.You also need to keep this machine clean and clean it regularly to keep it performing best.From start to finish - opening the box to cleaning the machine to my first cup took about 45 minutes - and it was time well spent.

A much better all around experience than Breville,"My husband bought this for my 65th birthday.  I used it a lot and really enjoyed the espresso.  I did not like the fact that the hopper was stationery.  If you put too much coffee in, you had to grind it because you aren't supposed to leave the coffee in. That before I realized I could weigh it.  I returned it and bought the Breville Barista Express. I made a BIG mistake. I watched videos of people who complained that you couldn't use a single walled filter. So I returned the LaSpecialista and guess what, I can't make a good cup of Espresso with the single-walled filter no matter what with the Barista Express.  What a dope I am. The La Specialista is a much nicer machine.  The tamper, the rack to make the espresso cup closer to the dispenser which makes for less splashing.And this is why I should not have returned the LaSpecialista. DeLonghi's customer service is fantastic and Breville doesn't have customer service. I have waited on the phone twice for 4+hours both times. I mean really and have never gotten a response. Never. Now my descaling process does not work. My poor husband wasted all that money on a machine that I will never be able to get serviced.",2 people found this helpful,No

After many years of faithful service, my replacement Gaggia gave up, so I was looking for an espresso machine that could provide ample pressure (and a grinder). Upon unboxing, I was impressed by the solid build quality and overall looks of the La Specialista; is it gorgeous on the countertop and has a bit of a 1950s vibe to it.Pros: Two independent heating systems (one for milk, one for coffee).  You can tamp directly in the filter holder.  The advanced latte system lets you choose between flat (hot milk only) or foam. It has three presets for espresso, Americano, and coffee.Be sure to read the instruction manual before attempting setup. It's worth watching all the DeLonghi how-to videos on YouTube first before setting up for the first time (especially about using the built-in grinder as this is my first machine that has one, and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve).  And you may want to experiment with the coffee bean grinder (any whole coffee beans will work; it doesn't have to be ""espresso"" blend!) to find the grind that's best for you.This is like upgrading to a Ferrari; absolute beauty! I loved the quick startup (my previous Gaggia took about 10 minutes to prime) and the quality of the crema / coffee (if you are a fan of flavored drinks, you can also make your own mochas or add flavored syrups; I loved the fact that this makes fantastic flat whites). Absolutely gorgeous foam, too.Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the La Specialista and look forward to many years of excellent lattes and cappuccinos!",2 people found this helpful,No

What is easy about this machine is that there is no mess or muss w the grinds spilling out, or wondering if i'm tamping with the adequate pressure or if i'm tamping at an angle, etc... since most of those variables are accounted for and taken out of the picture with the automated grind/tamp system in this machine. I think this machine allows aspiring amateurs like myself to get a better espresso with control over a few variables such as general heat, broad grind size, and water amount, without having to be an expert at grind preparation and tamping, controlling pressure directly or having an exact PID temperature controller. Altho this machine has a secondary milk heating system, it is not a true dual boiler, since you can't froth and pull a shot at the same time. But the delay is a bit shorter between shot and milk heat up with this machine. The plus with the ease of using this machine is that even my espresso-machine-phobic husband was willing to move the portafilter from the grind area to the group head and press the ""ok"" button to get a shot.The pics show me using the single shot (they provide the non-pressurized only) basket, and dark roasted (big box store) Guatemalan Arabica beans on the ""2"" fine grind level w a dosage dialed to the line in the tamped filter, and a 2 ""bar"" out of 3 heat setting.  I tried to use the instruction manual's suggested 1 bar heat setting and a ""5"" grind coarseness for dark roast coffees originally, but this gave me a weak and runny espresso.Although not shown, i also used a timer scale for a few pulls, just to check out what I was getting out. What I'm finding is that, at least with the beans I'm currently using, I can fit about 13g of coffee in the basket, and i'm getting about 35 g espresso out in a fast 12 seconds, w the pressure guage going to about the 11 o'clock region at the height. I tried to slow this down by using more coffee and a finer grind, but that did not work as well (basket got stuck, espresso did not taste as good)....so, i'm kinda wondering if i'm doing something wrong, but, ""2"" grind level as is, and 12 seconds tastes pretty good. i'll mess around with this more when i get to a different bean. I recently had also read about ""turbo"" shots that provide better extraction at relatively coarser grinds and faster speeds - such as my 12 sec, at a 1:2 or 1:3 grinds to espresso ratio being ideal for extraction, but that's a whole other controversy apparently. All I can say is that my espresso through this machine at the settings noted is flavorful, not bitter, bright tasting and yummy in general.I am having a big learning curve with the 3 hole milk frother wand tho, and it's been kinda challenging in comparison to the 1 hole wand i'm used to. Still, I made a decent looking froth at least for the pics shown.Overall, I'm liking this machine because I have some control of my espresso results, but my  non-caring-about-making-espresso-just-wanna-drink-it-now-can-u-just-make-it-for-me husband can pretty much make one too.  The resulting espresso is really tasty, and ultimately, that's what an espresso machine is for, i figure.",10 people found this helpful,No

It just upped the class of the whole room. My poor fridge has already developed an inferiority complex, and let's not even talk about my cheap drip coffeemaker!The machine was packaged really well in the large box. I was glad two of us were there to pull the lighter-weight box out of the heavyweight box, because it fit so snugly. I was also glad two of us were there to pull the styrofoam-encased machine out, and I was glad one of us (not me) was strong enough to feel confident taking it out and placing it on the countertop. This thing is quite heavy, because it's made out of lots of metal components that, from what I can tell, are high quality.While the espresso maker would fit underneath my cabinets, I wouldn't be able to fill the bean hopper there. We'll keep it where it is now, near the edge of the countertop. If I need that space, I could move it underneath the cabinet when I'm not filling the bean hopper, but like I said, it's heavy. You could scoot it, but do you want to?This is my first espresso maker, so I honestly didn't know what I was doing. The Quick Start Guide is slick and would probably work pretty well for someone who has used espresso makers before. However, I was glad to see that De'Longhi has a YouTube channel. It has plenty of good videos on it. Just search ""De'Longhi La Specialista"" (plus any additional search terms like ""latte"" or ""cleaning."") Look for the videos put out by ""De'Longhi How-To."" So far, I've found these videos to be helpful:-Setting up La Specialista for the first time-Making espresso for the first time-Making a Caffe Latte-Regular cleaning procedures of La SpecialistaI really wish the item had come with a full instruction manual. I like to have actual paper to flip through when I'm figuring out a new machine! I found the full instruction manual on De'Longhi's website. It was about 20 pages long, so I printed it out. Between that and the YouTube videos, I was in good shape.When I was setting up the machine, there was a red, bean-shaped, blinking light. I looked it up and realized I hadn't positioned the hopper correctly. The instruction manual helped me there. To properly position the hopper, place it in the machine (you'll be able to feel what position works), and twist to the left until it clicks. The lock icon on the hopper will line up with the arrow below. I wasn't twisting hard enough at first. (See photo for proper positioning.)Take the time to follow the instructions in the set-up video to prime your machine. Then take the time to follow the instructions in the espresso video to get your bean dosage and grind size correct. This all takes a while, but it's worth it! You'll probably end up wasting some grounds when you're getting the bean dosage correct. I saved mine in a plastic container to use in our regular drip coffeemaker later. By the way, to get enough grounds, I had to turn the dial for bean dosage further to the right than I expected; it's on the third mark.The cleaning video helped me. I hadn't realized the single and double filters (the ones that go inside the portafilter) each have a little part inside in the bottom that can be removed. If you look, you can see a little tab on the rubber gasket portion of the filter. Mine were placed in there so tightly, I had to use needle-nosed pliers to get that part off! It's supposed to be removed for cleaning. (See photo.) I hope that as I use it more, the part will loosen up a bit, but for now, I'm keeping pliers in the drawer below the machine.I LOVE the Smart Tamping lever! It's so easy to properly tamp down the grinds down! (See photo.)The accessories for this machine are generally heavy, which I love. The portafilter is heavy. The milk frothing jug is heavy. Even the water container feels like nice, thick plastic. The bean hopper feels lightweight, but it has a nice, metal lid.Clean-up will take some time, but there's no getting around that. It's really not too bad, and if you're making multiple drinks, you don't have to clean everything in between. (For instance, you can wait to clean the drip tray and milk steaming/frothing nozzle until you're done making drinks for your appreciative family and friends.)I made three tasty lattes, including one with almond milk, and my family members are already fans. I feel confident that, using this machine, I can make drinks rivaling the $5 ones I buy at Starbucks. I'm even going to try to learn to do some latte art, because why not?All in all, are there cheaper espresso makers out there? Absolutely. Many people, understandably, don't want to pay this much for a machine that makes coffee drinks. Having experienced the quality of this machine, I'm confident I'll enjoy the beverage-creation process more than I would with a more lightweight, budget-friendly machine. If you're getting an espresso maker because you want to save money instead of buying coffee shop drinks, you'll have to make a whole lot of drinks to break even on this machine! If you're getting an espresso maker because you enjoy the process of making your own drinks at home, and you put a high monetary value on quality and the pleasure of using well-made tools, this may be just the right choice for you.",16 people found this helpful,No

I am, however, quite the Starbucks lover. I am married to an ex-barista who is quite the snob about drinking coffee at home. I am not as picky, but I know a good cup of coffee when I have one in front of me. I figured between the two of our tastes and experiences that we could provide a well-rounded review. Setup was fairly simple. After yelling at my husband to read the instructions for the fifth time, it got cleaned & put together in about 20 minutes. This machine does not include the water softener filter so if you deal with hard water, plan to buy one in addition to the price of this machine. We’ve made two drinks so far and both have been amazing. We’ve made an iced caramel macchiato and a vanilla latte. The flavor is strong and brewed just right. Even for me, with no experience working an espresso machine, it was easy enough to figure out. Prep, brew, & clean up time took a total of 6 minutes from whole beans in the grinder to finished grinds in the trash. To compare to how much you’re spending on coffee already, when broken into daily payments over a year, it ends up being about $2.05. Way less than a grande or vente Starbucks drink price and according to the hubs way better in taste! I spent maybe $15 on Starbucks coffee beans, more almond milk, and some caramel drizzle that will last me over a month. Although it’s a lump sum in the beginning, you will be glad you made the investment. This machine is well worth it.UPDATE ON 8-11-19:I’m updating my review to add a few very important notes that I have learned since I posted my original review:1. Any coffee beans are “espresso” beans. This is probably basic knowledge to some, but I didn’t know that! I spent a good 30 minutes in publix looking for “espresso” beans. Lol.. live & learn.2. Watch all the YouTube videos! Making the perfect shot of espresso takes practice. I went to Costco & bought a big bag of beans and made about twenty shots just trying to perfect my skill!3. Only put the beans in the grinder before you go to make a cup. It makes for a much fresher tasting espresso.4. If you’re going to be making lots of espresso, invest in a good set of espresso glasses. I originally was using a stainless steel shot glass I had and my finger tips about burned off! I ordered JoyJolt double walled espresso glasses (the 2 oz ones) on Amazon and they have been a lovey addition to my morning espresso routine.5. The machine will stop grinding depending on where you turn the knob. I have found for a single shot of espresso, turning the grinder knob to the center and just a tad to the left that it makes the perfect amount for a great shot of espresso.6. The closer the espresso glass is to where the espresso is coming out is important! It creates a thicker level of crema.That’s about all I can think of right now. It truly is an amazing machine and I have enjoyed waking up knowing I get to go downstairs to this bad boy.",500 people found this helpful,No

Buyer Beware!,"If you are considering getting this machine... read on so you have a sense of what to expect.  If you have already, I sincerely hope your experience is better than ours.We have had this machine for about a year and a half.  About 4 months ago, the grinder stopped working.  It took me 40 min to get a hold of some one @ DeLonghi to get a repair (neve rmind online, where they promise a reply within 2 business days and I did not get any reply for over a month!).They did honor the 2 year warranty and repaired it at no charge... except that it took weeks to even get the box/paper work to send it to them and a couple of weeks to get it back (the latter, honestly, I was ok with).We have had it back now for about a month... and this morning it stopped working... again!  Now the computer thinks the water tank is empty (it is not, and we have inserted/re-inserted the tank several times), and wants to run the set up program (which we have run 4-5 times already)... to no avail!I am incredibly frustrated!  This was not a cheap item.  This was $800 and I would have expected better quality and better customer service.  I am at a loss. I was hoping for a better experience.  Now, I am back to my trusty coffee pot on the stove... until I figure something out.Still here are some comments I have for you to consider about the machine itself.What I love...It is relatively easy to set up and use... almost foolproof!It heats up quicklyIt is quieter than othersLots of features to make different drinks easilyFoams milk like a dreamThe tamping feature is really cool!  It helps control the mess and keep things tidy!But...There are several design “flaws”  you should be aware of...It is a tall machine... we have it under the upper cabinets and to get it in and out we have to take off the coffee bean hopper lidI absolutely dislike the fact you cannot take the hopper off when it is full of beans.  So, you are “stuck” with whatever beans you put in.  Other machines I have had lock the beans in and you can remove the hopper and the beans if you desire to change the coffee... which we do!It has only 6 grinder settings... we have it set one notch above the finest grind setting and we still are not getting the intensity of flavor we were used to get with other machines.  I wish there were more grind settings.I hope this helps you make a more informed decision.",162 people found this helpful,Yes

The most popular high end machine for making espresso at home has been the Breville Barista Express.  But that machine has a high learning curve.  Just learning to choose the right grind size from the many available options or consistently tamping the grounds with the right amount of pressure takes a lot of practice (and wasted coffee).  Not to mention learning to use the steam wand properly for milk based drinks.  You can spend about 4 times as much as the Breville would cost you to buy a superautomatic machine that makes really good espresso, such as the various Jura models.  Or you could spend just a little more money than the Breville and buy a machine like this new De'Longhi La Specialista Prestigio espresso machine, which automates some of the steps that are hard to master but still allows you more control over the process than a superautomatic machine would.  This De'Longhi only offers 6 choices for grind size, but with the built in sensor grinding technology, you don't need to be as precise when dialing in the grid size as you would need to be with a less advanced machine.  But perhaps the most useful feature of this machine is the smart tamping feature, which takes care of using just the right amount of pressure to tamp the grounds so you don't need to worry about that.  So whether you are a beginner or an expert when it comes to making your own espresso, you will always get more consistent results with this machine.  The steam wand is improved over previous De'Longhi models, but it does take a while to master the skill of using it to make really good lattes and cappuccinos.  However, after a little practice it didn't take me long to get much better results than I have been able to get with any other espresso machine I have used.  Overall this is a very nice machine, and probably the best value in a home espresso machine for under $1,000 that you will find anywhere.",61 people found this helpful,No

While it is easy to use making it attractive, it is terrible. There is a setting for coffee and americano, which is a waste of beans, because you will end up manually making the americanos because of the water espresso ratio3.

I love making mochas and capuchinos, but I have such a hard time trying to frothing and texturizing the milk to the creamer consistency to make lattes. With the Breville this process was a breeze.

My last was a Breville Oracle that finally died after 3 years.  In deciding what to replace it with I evaluated what I wanted to use it for.  For the last few years I only drink Americanos and to a lesser extent, Lattes.  So I wasn’t looking for an espresso machine to produce god shots for drinking straight espresso, but something more than good enough to produce excellent Americanos and Lattes.  The La Specialista met that quite well.It is easy to use and since I was well experienced with espresso making, dialing it in to produce great coffee was quick and easy.  From power on to ready to use is about a minute.  Then I do a blind shot to heat up the portafilter as a cold portafilter will negatively affect the espresso produced.  I leave the empty portafilter in the machine and use the Rinse button to get the preheat done.  Grinding works well as does the built in tamping with a side effect of not being as messy as using a separate grinder with a tamper often is.  One concern with the grinder is that to make good espresso the grind setting needs to be very close to the minimum grind size and over time, as the grinder burrs wear that will probably become an issue.  Fortunately DeLonghi sells a replacement upper burr for that very issue.Steaming excellent and nearly automatic for Lattes or Flat Whites, but I think it is a little weak for a cappuccino.  Cleaning of the steam wand is dead simple and since the wand is a no-burn type, cleaning off the outside is easy too.The various button combinations for changing some default settings work well and are well documented in the user manual.  The First Start pamphlet is excellent and well presented so getting the machines ready for that first use is really easy.",26 people found this helpful,Yes

The previous one was a Krupps fully automatic machine, made really good coffee but like all machines do at some point, it decided to die.There are quite a few machines in the $1200+ range and a few in the $600-1200 range, which is the price range I was looking at. I had short-listed to Gaggia vs Philips, leaning more towards Gaggia but reports of their poor customer service was disconcerting. Both of these are fully automatic. De'Longhi had the semi-automatic Magnifica but it didn't look pleasing aesthetically as far as matching the rest of my kitchen goes. Breville seemed a little too much work with manual tamping - as in, you actually take the tamper and press into the portafilter to tamp.Almost as I was finally ready to buy, I see this De'Longhi - la specialista. I have had this machine for about two weeks now.It is a semi-automatic machine. Its not a press-one-button-and-get-coffee machine, you will have to do some, a little, bit of work. Meaning, attach the portafilter to the grind unit and then the brew unit. Not a lot of work, and it actually feels good to be doing that!!Build quality is really really good. I am hard pressed to tell plastic from steel parts. Sides have the brushed steel look and chrome trims and I have no idea what is plastic. A very solid, well built machine. It looks really really good sitting on the counter, especially with that black 'dashboard' with the pressure gauge dominating the facade. The portafilter is solid and surprisingly heavy - you could easily use it for defense in case of burglary or something !! Same solid build is seen also in the included frothing mug and the filters, as well as the steel drip tray grill. Rest of the drip tray is plastic - the one place where plastic is obviously plastic.Power button turns it on of course - there's a master on/off switch in the back. Also in the back is a water reservoir which is surprisingly large.Attaching the portafilter to the grinder starts the grinding automatically. The machine will grind coffee for one or two shots if you press the 2x button.This is where my only frustration with the machine arose - frustration that has since been resolved. Start with factory default settings - fineness at 3 and amount of coffee dial at about 10 o'clock position. I was too impatient and started playing with the dials causing the machine to grind EXCESSIVE amounts of coffee and essentially malfunction. Ground coffee would back up the discharge chute from the grinder resulting in unhappy sounds from the machine and unhappy time for me.De'Longhi uses an ""exclusive"" new technology / sensor to determine how much coffee to grind. I think the common method is to grind for a certain amount of time. This machine detects the actual amount ground - I think. Anyway, I think this sensor is located in the chute which can be accessed by popping up a small flap located right at the base of the bean hopper. Using the provided brush tool, and a thin plastic stick, I unclogged this chute and cleaned out as much coffee grounds as I could. Problem solved. But it did take about half a bag of beans before getting that resolved.I blame the above on the fact that this is our first semi-automatic machine. There is a learning curve.Now that the vulnerable part is identified and addressed, the machine has been working without any issues whatsoever. I am actually coffee-making, barista style, on this thing. Coffee tastes really really good. Unlike the Breville, this one has a built in tamper - handle on the left side of the machine in the product photos. Once you attach the portafilter, the machine will automatically grind the dosed amount of coffee. Pull the handle down to tamp - there's a mark to tell you how much to pull. Remove the portafilter, attach it to the brewing station and press OK button. And you have your coffee.The built in milk frother / steam wand works really well too. The frother has a dedicated heating unit, separate from the brew unity. It has a 'flat' and 'foam' function. I tried both and really enjoy the foamed steamed milk. After watching a few YouTube videos, I learned to hold the included frothing mug at a certain angle and move it in circular motion etc but then discovered that the machine does a really fine job without those shenanigans. Just set the mug on the corner of the drip tray, stick the want in there and turn the dial for steaming. You get a luxurious micro froth without doing the dance I described. And the steam stops automatically. If you like your coffee actually hot though, you will have to do the steam twice. There is a function to increase the temperature of the coffee but I have not played with that setting so far.The cons are very few. Coming from a fully automatic machine, I had a to learn to use a semi-automatic one but that should be expected of any new tool / machine. The machine is full enclosed and does NOT have the easily removable brew unit that some manufacturers highlight, including DeLonghi. That might be an issue further down the road, but DeLonghi Magnifica and Breville don't have that feature as well and don't seem to be suffering as a result.Overall, I am really pleased with the machine. Great build quality, great coffee. Happy with the purchase.",16 people found this helpful,Yes

EASY FIX! I am sharing this to avoid returns and waits. I called De'longhi and they were absolutely no help! They actually told me to just take the tank off after each use to prevent leakage!!! Um no, that doesn't fix the problem people!!  So I was ready to return the unit but decided to check things out on my own. Here was my discovery...On the back of the machine under the water tank (take tank off) there is a clear star shaped gasket that regulates the flow of water into the machine.  Gently rock the valve with your finger until you feel it lay flat. Do this even if it appears to be flat already. It seems to reset the flow. Fixed my problem! I think it is caused my pressure build up? Hope this helps others with leaking issues.We have been using this now for two weeks. LOVE IT! As a former barista I would highly recommend this machine as it is pretty self explanatory. A few things we didn’t like of the top was the awkward placement of the water tank. It’s a bit difficult to put water in from a pitcher or jug. Recommend using a tumbler or a glass if it’s stored under cabinets. Another issue we had with the unboxing was we couldn’t get the grinder to operate. That was due to not twisting the dome on hard enough ( I was afraid of breaking the plastic) but it’s tougher than one would expect. The frother wand should be dissembled and cleaned after each use or fill a cup with water and run the air through to make sure the inner nipple is clean. No water leakage as others have mentioned in their comments. All and all we are very happy with our purchase. Brews a great espresso and americano. The more you use it the more comfortable you will become with the functions. I highly recommend buying the knock box and espresso shot glasses!",10 people found this helpful,Yes

We haven’t had any of the maintenance problems other users have had. I haven’t seen any reviews here from an “unwilling” household member, so I wanted to post this. We have had the same automatic drip coffee maker for over 10 years, so this was a serious upgrade for us. As a guy who “just wants a cup of coffee” in the morning, I was very skeptical that I could grow to love this machine. We have limited counter space and so didn’t want to have both. But my wife promised she’d make the coffee every morning, so I consented. Her promise lasted about two months, so indeed I was stuck using the machine as expected (and making hers as well)! Now I drink cappuccino every morning, because the taste is better than coffee (Americano) and it takes the same amount of time. That’s my chief complaint with this machine, the active time spent using it. You can't set it to be ready when you wake up, and the operation is active; you can't just push a button and walk away. So my experience is not in comparison to any other espresso maker, but compared to a “normal coffee maker.”I also wanted to share a few tips to getting the time down from 8 minutes to 4 minutes including clean up. This is for people who have been using the machine for a few months so you know what I’m talking about.1. Use the shelf of the machine for the milk foaming. If you use enough milk (we use heavy cream/almond milk), the steamer tube will reach into the milk while in the included steel “pitcher”. I have found no difference in milk/foam consistency if I stir the milk around or just let it sit. I use this time (usually takes 2 steam cycles) to empty out the grounds and clean up the filter holder.2. I use a small metal spoon to clean out the grounds from the filter rather than banging it, which has been faster and makes less of a mess. I’ve been doing this for the past 4 months and have not noticed any scrapes to the filter or filter cup. The sooner you do this after use the easier it is.3. We remove and rinse the filter after each use. This was very annoying for me as I have big fingers and it’s nearly impossible to grip the tiny rubber tab to pull the filter out. Then my wife showed me a trick: just use a small corner torn off from a paper towel to pull the tab. It gives you just enough grip to easily pull out the filter, and works every time.I clean the filter and cup while the milk is foaming and this has made coffee making into only a minor annoyance rather than the serious one it was before.My other complaint is the noise that the foamer makes. Surprisingly, the way that you orient/tilt the milk pitcher makes a big difference. Play around with it until the noise is reduced. I used to wake up the whole house with what I would call the “shrieking beasts of hell”, but now they have mostly been tamed.Overall, I’m happy with the purchase, but it took some getting used to.PS:  In case anyone is wondering, each steam cycle adds about 30ml of water to your beverage. I weighed the milk pitcher before and after steaming. Yes, I'm a nerd.",9 people found this helpful,Yes

We have found it with this De’Longhi.  I have a Nespresso Innissa for quick espressos and a Barista-style espresso machine I got on Amazon, but the De’Longhi sails far above either of those machines.  And so it should at this price point, but I do believe this machine would be hard to beat in the sub-$1000 category of home espresso machines.  A fantastic feature that really makes a difference is the built-in tamper.  Tamping usually makes a mess on the counter but this machine with the pull of handle on the side does it before you remove the portafilter.  I got lucky to set the grind right the second time so that the coffee, once tamped, was right at the level line indicated to get a great brew.  I set my grind to #4 for my coffee beans and that seemed to work well also.  Another excellent feature of the De’Longhi is the pull down tray to place your cup(s) on.  Keeping your cup close to the drip also aids in getting the best crema on your espresso.  I ran a cup through both of my espresso machines using the same beans and you could really taste the difference the De’Longhi made.  The coffee (same coffee) actually tasted better!  I think it goes to show the technology in these higher-end machines and the superior extraction process.  I know this isn’t a cheap decision but if you are going up to that sub-$1000 price range, I don’t think you can beat this machine.  I will also add that it is just gorgeous looking in terms of design and really impresses on the kitchen countertop!",8 people found this helpful,No

My husband loves espresso, but orders from a local restaurant when he's in the mood and he is no barista.I'm a tea drinker, so yeah, what do I know. For the review I can tell you this, husband and visitor loved the results from the first shot. The beans ground in moments (just the right amount, automatically), the tamper is built in and tamps just right, the coffee brewed beautifully, and had the nice crema that apparently espresso drinkers appreciate for a silky touch.So I can't talk to the taste, but I can say that this is a well built machine and heavy, although there is some plastic involved. Still, it's a high quality appliance. The controls are self-explanatory (although reading the manual would be helpful for the uninitiated).This appliance will be much appreciated in our New England home by the visitors who are accustomed to a daily jolt or two of Cafe Cubano. We're ready.UPDATE Aug 13 2022: And on this day the grinder died. An hour spent cleaning the hopper and grinder parts and no luck. Downgraded to three stars and those remain because it really does make great coffee I'm told, and it still brews.But turns out it's a complicated process even for some people who know how to use an espresso maker, impossible for those who haven't without the instructions and no one bothers with instructions, they just barrel ahead.Be prepared to be the sole barista when guests arrive.FURTHER UPDATE: We sent it to an authorized repair company and they fixed it. From now on if someone wants an espresso they can wait until we prepare it for them.Still three stars.

I have machines and accessories for just about every way of preparing coffee, to include 3 espresso machines, and a stove top (Mokka).  For the past few years we have been using a Phillips Saeco machine.  It is very easy, and also very good, but it does consistently pour a little water into the cup before it dispenses coffee... so it is good, but less than ideal.Some years ago I read on Coffee Geek that your grinder can make as much of a difference as your machine/ method of preparation.  I went through half a dozen grinders before I found one which lasted for more than a month or two past warranty (and there were several expensive grinders from well known companies).  The machine which lasted, the one we still use 6 or 7 years later, is a De'Longhi.  I also have a toaster oven from De'Longhi in my garage.  We used it for over 20 years, replacing it only this year with an air fryer, but held onto the De'Longhi in case that gives out.  All that said, I know that De'Longhi makes solid equipment which performs well and is reliable.  In fact, I sent my son a De'Longhi espresso machine when he graduated from college and then got stranded in California, by the shut downs.  Sensibly the next machine I would look at would be a De'Longhi.This machine does take more effort than the one we had been using, but it is an all in one machine.  It has a conical burr grinder which dispenses into the portafilter.  There is also a built in tamper.  The portafilter is then moved to where the water is expressed.  You can adjust the coarseness/ fineness of the grind and the amount of coffee ground/ dispensed as well as the amount of water and temperature.  A chart is provided with suggestions based on the roast.  There are also options with respect to how much froth is produced.This machine provides a lot more control than the Saeco and the amount of water, speed, heat are determined based on grind and dose settings.  The end result was espresso which was much better than I have been able to make with the other machines I have had.While the machine is not automatic, everything you need is provided, with recommendations for getting the best from each type of roast, but you can choose the grind and amount based on personal preferences, and store some of those choices with the ""my"" button.",5 people found this helpful,No

It’s all stainless steel and is ready for decades of use because the stainless will look good for the life of the espresso machine without rusting away like other materials would have. And with all the other pieces and parts fitting perfectly well and made to last just like the stainless it can and will be passed on hopefully to another espresso lover just like myself. The instructions were informative and easy to read and understand and the pictures helped me immediately with setup and use. It grinds the beans to exacting specifications for this machines use. It does the tampering to required pressure as well with just a push of a button. I’m getting better and faster everyday in its use and with it doing most of the work for me with probably one hundred percent more accuracy than me. Each and every espresso I let it make for us is the perfect cup every time, all the time. It does get noticed immediately sitting on our counter the moment eyes set on it as it’s brilliant brightness and ultimate quality stands out against every other appliance we have. Definitely starts many a conversations. I’m fully satisfied with the quality of and the functionality it provides us daily. Update (24 December 2021) added a picture of the pressure dial getting into the optimal zone. Once dialed in we were rewarded with a great tasting five star experience!! Update (17 February 2022) We definitely are still enjoying the espresso machine and it’s ease of use but when it needs to be descaled everything comes to a screeching halt for 45 minutes. I turned it on this morning to prepare it for our drinks and we are just sitting around now waiting for it to descale. Maybe a switch so it’s not always need descaling at the critical time we need it the most. But still 5 stars. Five Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!! Update (March 7 2022) I stand corrected, as long as the knob is in any other position other than the descaling mode when the light comes on it will still continue to make espressos until AFTER the morning rush and can be descaled at our leisure later that day or night. We are still happy with the daily operation of the machine!!  Still 5 Stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!",5 people found this helpful,No

After using it 2 or 3 times a day for the past two weeks, I can say without any exaggeration that it looks and performs exactly like a professional espresso machine and has everything you need to make espresso drinks that taste *exactly* as good as the best coffee houses. Although I could write a full report detailing why I believe it is an outstanding machine, I'll limit this to a just-the-facts paragraph. First off, it is fast, and you can have a double-espresso latte made within 5 minutes of turning it on. It is also the cleanest real espresso machine that I've ever used; the grinder doesn't leave coffee grounds anywhere and any small amounts of powder from the tamper collect straight down into the drip tray. The tamper is connected to the tamping lever with a spring which ensures that you don't over- or under-tamp the basket. The brewing has a perfect amount of automation, by which I mean that you still have a good control of the coarseness of the grind and the brewing temperature. One thing that really stands out to me is that it has a gauge that gives you feedback on the brewing pressure which gives you direct feedback to use for adjusting the grind coarseness for the specific beans that you're using. Selecting between a single or double shot is as easy as pressing a button and switching between espresso, Americano, or single serving of regular coffee in just a turn of a knob. For the Americano, it even automatically adds the right amount of hot water. The steam wand is really impressive because the control knob activates a pump that pulses water into the steam chamber which eliminates having to drain the wand of condensate and also ensures that there is the right amount of steam pressure. I could easily go on about this machine but suffice it to say that it really is that impressive! Highly recommend!",4 people found this helpful,No

For the longest time I still couldn’t justify spending this much on a coffee machine, however I’m here to say that the D’longhi Specialista is worth every penny plus some. Aesthetically, this machine looks excellent on your countertops. Performance wise, this expresso machine is impressive and makes some of the best coffee you will ever have. The grinder on the top is great so that I don’t have to use my extra coffee grinder and the coffee is always super fresh. It portions out the exact amount needed for a cup of expresso based on your selection. It is a bit tricky to get the hang of initially, but the instructions are clear (plus their are videos online) and once you get the hang of it, it’s not complicated at all. It’s just going from a Keuirg to a fancy machine like this takes a bit of practice. I can make a double shot of expresso and foam/ steam my milk and no longer need to make a coffee run to get the coffee I desire. You can even pick the temperature that you want which is nice. Machine is tall, so if you have an older 1950’s home with shorter cabinets you will need to measure to be sure it fits under cabinet. We are not done renovating yet so cabinets are still short and I have to remove grinder accessory to push it so it sits flush under cabinet.Overall, I would highly recommend this.

One daughter works as a barista in a private high end coffee shop and is used to expensive equipment. That said...We all think this is a great machine.Everything about it feels and looks like quality, it is well designed, and it works well.Unboxing and setting it up was fairly simple.  As is typical (I guess) it took a few days of tweaking to fine tune it to our coffee preferences, but even the trial and error ""fails"" were drinkable.A big plus is the tamping. It is manually done... sort of. Well, it's foolproof. Hand tamping can be a learned skill (that I never quite mastered), but this doesn't require that. There is a lever on the side of the machine (like a slot machine) which is mechanically set to tamp to the right density. Works great, even when I do it!The milk frother is the real deal (though I'm not the big user), and works well. We (they) can make just about any coffee drink known to man now.There are also auto settings for americanos and regular coffees, but we really stick to the double espresso setting.Love it!

In those years I have repeatedly tried to get good at making espresso (my partner is the espresso maker in our house).  Every time, I give up.Part of that is because it feels too easy to make a mistake and part of that is because its a huge mess. Particularly getting the grounds from the grinder, and then temping them down. I know that probably sounds finicky and whiny to folks who really love their espresso but I hate it and it led to our counters never feeling clean.The fact that grinding and tamping is in the machine is infinitely better. It keeps our counters cleaner but it also means that when we get new beans, my partner can do all the fiddling to get the exact right grind and dose and then we just leave it that way for me to make my own drinks. Despite using this machine for over a month, I still don't know the principles behind getting the perfect pull, and I am totally okay with that. I am making more espresso drinks now than I ever did with the Gaggia. I don't know if purists find that annoying, but the added features make it a lot more user friendly. I am even pretty confident if my mom came to visit, I could show her how to do it once and then she could just make her own drinks.SIZEBecause the photo I took has the Gaggia in front of the De'Longhi it makes the Gaggia look a bit bigger than it actually is. It is definitely narrower, but a tiny bit taller. It used to live under our cabinet and had a fairly small footprint on the counter. The De'Longhi is more substantial and can't fit under the counter. If you took off the lid to the bean hopper, you could totally put it under the counter but that would leave the beans unprotected from the air and they would go stale. If your cabinets are a bit taller you might be okay but I think they are generally hung at a standard height. Because of that, we have it half under the cabinet with the hopper sticking out. There's only one real place in our kitchen that it fits that way, which is right next to the sink. While I think I'd prefer to have it on the left side of the sink which is impossible to do, this is okay - not ideal but okay.OVERALLIn the end, this is a nice compromise for my partner and I. He's super into making espresso and getting things as perfect as possible. I'm not interested in that at all, I just want good coffee. This is an excellent way for both of us to have what we want without me having to bug him for every drink. I also use the hot water function for tea every morning which means I can put my kettle in the cabinet. There is a way to change how much water comes out with the hot water function I believe but I haven't fiddled with it yet.",2 people found this helpful,No

It had a bit of a learning curve, though. So first… The unpacking itself was impressive. The packaging was done so well I barely could get the tightly packed machine out of the attractive and well-designed box.  The machine and its parts were packed within some seriously dense foam and the smaller parts were packed within a much smaller well-designed box within the main box.  The machine and parts were wrapped in a plastic wrap that ensured that even a small blemish could not occur during packaging or shipping.  The box contained all the parts necessary to make all types of one- and two-shot drinks: 2 espresso filters to make a single or a double espresso, descaling tablets, a stainless-steel milk pitcher, and a cleaning brush, and single-use descaling solution.My friend and I removed the parts from the box and we began the very small amount of assembly and setting the unit up on my countertop.  I decided to fill the bean hopper before I installed it onto the top of the machine.  I lay out a cloth and filled the hopper and once I started to move the hopper to the top of the machine, beans fell out of the bottom of the hopper onto the countertop.  Yes, the bean hopper has an open bottom.  That made us realize that you cannot remove the bean hopper while there are beans in it and it is installed on the top of the machine because they will spill out over the top of the machine and onto your counter and floor.  The bean hopper must be visibly empty to remove it from the top of the machine or you must vacuum the beans out of the hopper before removal from the machine or later vacuum the beans off the counters and floor.After that fiasco, I decided I might want to refer to the Quick Start Guide for the remaining setup items.  If in doubt, read the manual/quick start guide. The Quick Start Guide is helpful but in no way takes the place of the full manual.  My initial test results were poor.  But, after reading the full manual and still getting less than optimal results in grinding and brewing, I decided that the full manual does not take the place of the many YouTube videos available to help with settings and operation of the machine.  After reviewing several YouTube videos, I got to action, made some adjustments, and had much better results.I really like the integrated grinder with Sensor Grinding Technology which provides consistent grinding and the Smart Tamping Station perfect pressure tamper.  It took some looking at YouTube videos for me to understand the grinding operation and how to adjust the grind to get the optimal grind for crema but once I tinkered with it and did several test grinds and test shots of espresso, I better understood the adjustment needed to get the optimal shot and crema with the coffee beans I was using.  I believe it will be easy to adjust the grind to suit any other coffee bean I might choose in the future should I decide to change the brand and type of bean.  Understanding and using the tamping mechanism was a breeze.My favorite part of the machine is the Immediate Start function.  Yes, you can power the machine on and start grinding immediately.  While you are grinding, the machine is readying itself for the brewing, preparing hot water for Americano and/or milk frothing.  It uses two independent heating systems so there is no waiting time between the espresso and the milk preparation.  The Advanced Latte System is super easy to use and I was able to make the perfect foam the very first time I tried.  There are two options for milk – foam and flat.  The only downside is I wish the stainless-steel milk frothing pitcher were larger.  It only holds enough for a small latte.  I will definitely be purchasing a larger pitcher.The overflow tray offers a warning by use of a piece of floating plastic that sticks up through the tray as the tray fills.  By the time this happens, the tray is difficult to remove and balance to get it to the sink to empty.  Since it is easy to remove and check for fullness, I would suggest you remove it and rinse it before it gets to this level.  Some of the buttons function to give water for rinsing and steam for other parts of the machine for cleaning.Overall, the great design of this espresso maker makes this piece of equipment fancy up my countertop.  It’s just a gorgeous amalgam of stainless steel that looks luxurious and professional at the same time.I do think some things could be better.  For one, the milk steamer pitcher is small – very small – only 12 oz.  That may sound big enough but it only holds enough milk and foam for a half-full mug of latte.  But that is an easy to resolve issue by purchasing a larger pitcher.  The bean hopper should have some type of mechanism that would allow it to be removed without losing all of the beans.  I would think some type of an operable lever that could close off the hopper might be a plus.  I also think the height of the bean hopper can be a problem with top cabinets that are not abnormally high.  Mine are about 17-1/2”, pretty close to new Cabinet standards, and the hopper lid does not fit on the hopper and fit under my cabinet.  It’s just a little too tall. I am using a small piece of plastic to cover the hopper when it is under the cabinet.  This could be a major problem for some because many cabinets are much lower than mine.  Also, the low upper cabinet might get in the way of operating the tamper lever.  In addition, the drip tray could use an early warning system instead of a “too late” system to notify the user that it is full.  And, lastly even though the water fill chamber holds quite a bit of water and the machine seems efficient in its use of the water, I would appreciate it if the water fill chamber was on the side for easier filling and access.Since my machine has only been in use a couple of days, I have not yet descaled.  I’m certain I will provide lots of use and therefore opportunity to see if it continues to function well.  If not, the machine has a one-year parts and labor warranty. I will amend this review if I find any major flaws or if this espresso maker does not hold up as I think it will.  So far, I am very pleased with this De’Longhi La Specialista espresso maker.Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

A few years ago, I started working from home, and I got in the habit of going to Starbucks every morning to have a few minutes of human interaction before returning to my home office. By early August, I realized I had spent over $900 year to date on coffee, decided it needed to stop, and picked up a Keurig. It saved me a ton of money, but it wasn't nearly as good as espresso drinks. Enter the DeLonghi!Size/Space: First thing's first - before you jump in and order one yourself, figure out if you have anywhere you can put it! The unit itself is about 16"" wide, 16"" deep (with power cord), and 17-1/2"" high. The height is a big one, because the standard clearance from kitchen countertops to cupboards is 18"" - however, if the kitchen has been remodeled, the counter tops may have been upgraded to a thicker surface than older materials - I found my cupboards were only 17-1/4 to 17-1/2"" above the countertops, and it wasn't possible to slide this under the cupboards, so I had to find a new home. Now, even if you DID put it under the cupboards, you may find that you don't have sufficient access to remove the water reservoir on the back or access the bean hopper on top without pulling the unit out, which can be a little bit challenging in its own right. Height issues aside, you should be aware of the width - it's about 16"" wide total, but you can't sandwich this right up against a wall - you need clearance on BOTH. I'd say you need about 3-4"" minimum on either side to operate the tamper (left) and the knob for the steam wand (right). Minimum, I'd say you need 20"" of space, or it needs to be next to items on the counter that are shorter than the knobs (I have mine on one edge of the counter, and a knife block next to the machine that is short enough to easily operate the knob and steam wand)Setup: Initially, it can be a little challenging to figure out how to use it, but after doing it once, it's easy. Fill the Reservoir in back (filtered water recommended), Fill the bean hopper with your preferred espresso beans and turn the base of the hopper to the preferred grind setting (1-8, the guide that came with the machine suggested about a 4 for a medium roast which was a very good starting point). Turn the unit on with the Portafilter detached. The Portafilter has interchangeable single shot or double shot baskets - putting the basket in the first time is a little difficult because the springs are new, give it a good press/smack with your palm. Now, *IF* you're making a double shot, choose the ""x2"" button on the face of the machine first. Choose your extraction temperature on the face - it's indicated with 3 horizontal bars, and pressing the button cycles between 1, 2 and 3 bars - DeLonghi recommends 2 bars for Medium Roast beans. Finally, you'll have to adjust the ""dose"" (amount of ground beans) with a dial. You may need to waste some grind/beans the first time to get it right - start low and adjust the dose until, when tamped, the grind is even with the stamped ring inside the portafilter basket (adjusted for both single and double shot baskets)Daily use: Once you get that set up above dialed in, it's pretty easy - turn the machine on, insert the Portafilter - the machine will automatically grind the beans into the filter. Once the grind is finished, the machine will flash the tamping indicator to let you know to pull the arm to tamp the grind - just pull the arm to the indicated full pull line, and you're set. Remove the portafilter and insert it into the brew head, set your cup/mug under it, and press the ""Ok"" button (could have been called start). You'll have espresso within about 60 seconds of turning the machine on. I had a perfect shot the very first time I used the machine, and I was shocked. I worked at a Starbucks 25 years ago, and I vividly remember needing to adjust my tamping pressure a few times nearly every time I started a shift until I had it right. Now that I've been using this about 2 weeks, I continue to adjust a little, but I haven't yet had anything that resembled a *bad* shot - just ranging from good to perfect.Steaming: This is one area where I'm not thrilled with the machine. The dial on the right hand side of the machine has two settings - on or off. You turn the dial all the way until it clicks to start the steam, and then you click it off to stop, and starting the steam isn't instant - it builds pressure before releasing it. I would have preferred the knob work as an adjustable valve to control the flow. The other thing I don't love about the wand is that it is TOO vertical. 17.5° from vertical is as far as you can move it, so it's not as easy as I'd like to get a good vortex in the pitcher to incorporate the foam. I was able to adjust to this after a couple days, so if you get your technique down, it works fine. I think a small change to the wand would make this much nicer though.Side note: get yourself a clip-on dial thermometer for your pitcher for steaming milk. Using a thermometer will keep you from scorching your milk. They can be found, with clip, for as little as $9 - but it may be worth spending a few dollars more. This is a detail that I think DeLonghi is missing - it would be great if they included a clip with thermometer properly sized/fit for the included pitcher - the thermometer I bought is a bit long for my liking.Cleaning: This is perhaps the area that can be burdensome - I'm pretty much the only one drinking espresso in the house (unless my mother-in-law is visiting), so it can be a little time consuming to clean the Portafilter, Pitcher, and Steam Wand every morning after making myself a latté - but all told, the process takes 5 minutes - less time than stopping in a coffee shop, and much less once you factor in time getting there and back.Final Verdict: While the size of this machine caused some early consternation, once I found a home for it, I quickly grew to enjoy it. Early on, I doubted that I'd use it daily, but there's only been one day since setting it up that I didn't use it - and that was only because I woke up to a colossal work disaster that left no time for even the smallest of luxuries. The quality of the espresso has far exceeded my expectations! As for time and convenience, a few years ago I dated someone with a Nespresso machine - and I don't think there's a whole lot of time savings in using the Nespresso versus using this to make proper espresso - using the Nespresso pods probably saves 1-2 minutes, and most of that is really in clean-up.",One person found this helpful,No

Seriously perfect. Like, I almost cry with the first sip every. single. time. I also love the bean hopper and how easy the tamping process is with this. There are many challenges, however, with the rest of the machine. The first being that it draws so much amperage, that it flips the circuit almost every time I use it. We live in a new custom home with a brand new electric system. From the street, to the box, to the wiring. I’ve never had a breaker trip. Even when using multiple large appliances at the same time. It’s a pain. Next disappointment is the steam/wand. It’s really lame. It doesn’t build much steam power and it “pulses” the steam. It takes forever to froth milk. The wand doesn’t have a big enough range of motion to hold a bigger size pitcher comfortably. I ended up purchasing a countertop milk frother that is <<chef’s kiss!>> But again, how stupid that I need an additional step. The last thing is the interface. It’s totally and needlessly complicated. Please just give me 2 shots of espresso, an option for hot water after my shots are pulled and froth the milk quickly and creamy. I don’t want 5 additional and irrelevant buttons and lights to blink at me every morning, pre-coffee. Overall, I think this machine is trying to do too much so it fails to do the 1 thing perfectly. For the price of this machine, that’s a big bummer. But the espresso it makes, did I mention how incredible it tastes???",One person found this helpful,No

   This De'Longhi La Specialista Prestigio Espresso Machine is well made and a bit heavy because it is solid. The assembly is very minimal. There are two manuals and both must be referred to because the more colorful one doesn't have all the parts identified. Some of the better features include the filter holder assembly which has a long handle on it and locks into place and automatically initiates the grinding of the beans in the hopper. The big advantage is that when it locks into place, there is no place for ground coffee to fall out and make a mess. Also, the tamper is built in and the coffee is precisely tamped and since the tamping takes place with no place for the coffee to fall out, again there is no coffee ground mess. One can make either coffee or espresso with this machine.  In my pictures you can see one cup with coffee and the other with espresso.  The grind of the beans can be adjusted allowing for different strength and smoothness. The frothier can be set to specific settings so the cup does not have to be moved around to get the desired results. The espresso maker can be set to self clean with steaming hot water. Excess water runs down into the tray and a red plastic pieces floats up through the grill to show you when it is time to empty the water out of the tray. This machine gives professional results without having to have professional technique. This is the most user friendly espresso machine I have ever operated.",One person found this helpful,No

I would wake up to a puddle of water every morning. In addition... The water doesn’t get hot enough, the grinder is no where near the quality that it needs to be to make the kind of espresso that you think you are paying for.

The La Specialista is a much nicer machine.  The tamper, the rack to make the espresso cup closer to the dispenser which makes for less splashing.And this is why I should not have returned the LaSpecialista.

After many years of faithful service, my replacement Gaggia gave up, so I was looking for an espresso machine that could provide ample pressure (and a grinder). Upon unboxing, I was impressed by the solid build quality and overall looks of the La Specialista; is it gorgeous on the countertop and has a bit of a 1950s vibe to it.Pros: Two independent heating systems (one for milk, one for coffee).  You can tamp directly in the filter holder.  The advanced latte system lets you choose between flat (hot milk only) or foam. It has three presets for espresso, Americano, and coffee.Be sure to read the instruction manual before attempting setup. It's worth watching all the DeLonghi how-to videos on YouTube first before setting up for the first time (especially about using the built-in grinder as this is my first machine that has one, and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve).  And you may want to experiment with the coffee bean grinder (any whole coffee beans will work; it doesn't have to be ""espresso"" blend!) to find the grind that's best for you.This is like upgrading to a Ferrari; absolute beauty! I loved the quick startup (my previous Gaggia took about 10 minutes to prime) and the quality of the crema / coffee (if you are a fan of flavored drinks, you can also make your own mochas or add flavored syrups; I loved the fact that this makes fantastic flat whites). Absolutely gorgeous foam, too.Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the La Specialista and look forward to many years of excellent lattes and cappuccinos!",2 people found this helpful,No

Just did my second descaling, no problems.  Still very happy and my wife loves every cup I make for her (of course she does!).  No leakage, remember to keep the portafilter inserts clean!Original review: This is a nice looking machine, and after three weeks I cannot say it has any problems at all.  I dialed in the grind (set at 2 and about 5/8 of full dial setting) and used some 20 dollar Lavazza Blu/Oro beans, the coffee was amazing.  The crema is quite good, it would be better if the head was heated by water like others, but run a hot water preheat before you start brewing.  Try to warm the cup too, will hold the crema longer.  For the price, this is quite good.  The steam heater works well, if you put an inch and a half of milk in the provided pitcher, the sixty second steam cycle is sufficient, but use a thermometer anyway, it is best gage of readiness and they cost about 10 bucks with the clip.  I believe cleaning is most important thing about these machines, blow out the steam tube, clean the steam wand, disassemble it and wipe the rubber tube after you're done with it for the time of day.  Use filtered water, this is not a FAEMA or professional machine, it will help you keep the pump and piping cleaner longer.  Don't let coffee get stale in the hopper, just put what you need for a few days at most.  Clean between the two disks of the portafilter, and rinse it out too.One thing that happened once is that a suction developed in the water line, not sure but seems like a check or stop valve got cycled by an air bubble.  I stopped the cycle when the trouble lights appeared, lifted and reseated the tank, and it burped when I restarted the cycle.  D'longhi should look into that, it might be a reason others have had problems with the water-out lights coming on.All said, having this quality of espresso at home is a wonderful thing, beats starbucks by a long shot.  If you want flavorings look up Torani syrups, I bought some for an occasional twist when I want it.  I will update if I have any other news on my experiences with this machine.  I think it is a good purchase so far.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

I mainly make lattes and americanos with the occasional cappuccino. I think Starbucks drinks are just ok, not good or great.  I purchased this De'Longhi La Specialista to replace a Breville 870. The advertised La Specialista dimensions don't accurately indicate just how big this machine is. With the grinder hopper attached, the actual height is about 17.5 inches and with the poorly designed power cord attached the depth is 16 inches. Lots of counter space is needed. The design of the built in tamper and grinder chute make getting the correct grind and tamp more difficult than necessary due to not being able to see how much coffee is being dispensed and feeling the tamp pressure. This process is an important part of pulling a good espresso shot. Only pressurized filters are provided. Once the grind and tamp are set as best as possible the resulting shots are only mediocre. The pucks are a mess, often not releasing from the filter causing the filter to drop out of the portafilter into the knock box and the puck needing to be scooped out of the filter.  The water reservoir is hidden on the sides so the water level can only be seen from the back of the machine. The steam wand is actually comprised of two pieces and milk goes up into the tubes requiring both pieces be removed and cleaned after each use. This is an easy process but I question how well the wand will hold up over time with this daily removal. Beans must be removed from the hopper prior to removing the hopper as there is no closing mechanism to hold the beans in the hopper. These issues are unacceptable for a machine at this price point. Now the pros; this is a good looking machine and is quiet, the steam wand does work well, easily frothing milk, and the warm up time is very quick. This machine makes better coffee drinks than a drip or pod coffee maker but isn't as good as other options in this price range. I returned mine and purchased another 870.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

The setting of the grinder is not consistent and difficult to adjust, especially at the finest grind settings.2. The milk foamer (expander) does not make higher density foam that I was used to with the Breville (manual) steamer and it is too easy to bump the wand into its ""flat"" setting3. The portaflter is deep and not very wide so I have great difficulty emptying the used grounds into a ""bang box."" I have to use a tool every time; which is very messy. I never had that problem with the Breville portafilter with its different aspect ratio.4. The very small holes in the portafilter tend to get clogged and they are difficult to clean.5.

Descaling is a process that removes hard water mineral build up from the sensitive components inside the espresso maker.

I ended up choosing this over a similar Breville machine because of the additional hot water spout. I was initially apprehensive about the price, but now I don't know how I waited so long to get one of these. The only problem now is that I want to drink coffee all day!The machine is super easy to use, yet it's fun to operate and you feel like a professional barista. You get your coffee as fast as you would from a pod machine, but it tastes like you got it at a coffee shop. Once the machine is set up (not difficult), brewing a coffee is as simple as:1. Attach the filter to the grinder. The correct amount of beans will grind automatically.2. Tamp the grounds with the lever.3. Attach the filter to the brewer and place a cup underneath.4. Select your drink and hit OK.There are some great features that make it easy to create the full range of coffee shop drinks:* You can easily grind and brew 1 or 2 shots. Filters are provided for both sizes.* You can select espresso, Americano (espresso + hot water), or ""coffee"" (AKA a lungo), and the machine applies the correct amount of water and brewing time.* A separate button will provide hot water only, making this the easiest way to brew tea.* There is a wand that can froth or steam milk so you can make cappuccinos and lattes.I initially thought the coffee was not hot enough, but I checked the manual and found a setting to use a higher water temperature. There is also a bit of trial and error to set the grinder to get exactly the right ""dosage"" of grounds per shot, but once you have that dialed in, you don't have to worry about it again for a long time.In conclusion, this is a great machine and I'm so glad I bought it. I can think of very few purchases where I was just as excited to use the thing weeks after I got it, and this is one of them.PS. If you ever see ""Amazon Warehouse"" selling one at a deep discount, go for it. I got a $300 markdown because one corner of the shipping box was slightly dented.

I think DeLonghi tried to compete with Breville all-in-one machine and this attempt failed. They tried to couple their EC680M cheap machine with a grinder and the grinder is terrible. First, you need to grind always to the finest setting, and it is not fine enough. The beverage is sour (underextracted). the grinder has only 6 settings (a joke? only 6?) and they are all useless, since you need to set it to 1. And the espresso is not good. They tried to fix this problem by replacing regular baskets with pressurized baskets (they are more forgiving), but it means it is NOT espresso. Pressurized = bad. The tamper is a joke.When you brew espresso, the gauge in front of the machine NEVER shows the optimal zone. Never! Watch some youtube videos, never. I saw just one video, where the zone shown was optimal, but the guy used much more beans, filling the basket well above the limit.Verdict: it is not just a machine that is not as good as the others. The whole design is flawed, the machine simply does not work. I got it as a gift to friends in Taipei, so I cannot ship from there and  return.$799 just wasted. DeLonghi, have conscience! Return money! And fire all the designers.Google, there is a video, where a guy in France found a solution.

I worked with De'Longhi to resolve and was unable to get it working.  At this point I was told they would send me a box so I could return it and they would fix it and send it back to me.  I had missed Christmas Eve and Christmas day coffee with my family and was unhappy at the prospect of weeks without my espresso machine.  So, I called Amazon on Friday, explained my situation, and had a new machine on my doorstep Monday morning!  Technically, my 30 day Amazon return window had closed, but after hearing my story, customer service came through!In the meantime, the DeLonghi box never arrived.  I did get a phone call from them about a week after I received my new machine telling me how sorry they were that my problem had fallen through a crack in the system.  So, I guess I should be hopeful that the 2 year warranty on the machine will be honored.  Still, cant thank Amazon enough.BTW:  the new machine is amazing.  Makes amazing espresso (for me) and Americanos (for my husband) and the milk frother is outstanding.  Once you have it down, it can't be beat!",2 people found this helpful,Yes

It takes time to dial in and when you clean it or even change beans you have to readjust. It’s not a problem for us as we have the time to do so. We have had zero issues and use it very frequently. I definitely recommend this unit and it’s very easy to use once it’s dialed in.As people have stated the water low light will come on when you first get it, even if the water tank is full. All you have to do is READ the directions and prime the system. I am amused by the amount of people who send this unit back when all they have to do is read the directions. P!! A YEAR LATER UPDATE!!

The footprint is not too bad and my wife will maybe let me bring it in the house instead of my office.  I think I'll keep it close to me. :)Update:  Two weeks after setting this up and only a handful of coffees I started noticing that the countertop had water on it after use.  At first, I thought it was from cleaning up around the unit or it settling in.  Boy was I wrong.  This unit leaks a significant amount of water all the time, but its haphazard as to when.There is definitely a design flaw someplace. I notice it most after doing a couple of cups back to back, but it can also happen with a single cup.  I typically will froth some milk and then make a couple of cups of Americano to use with the milk.  If I stop the Americano short of the full cycle or stop the frothing after the machine warms up, I notice the water the most.  Typically right after shutting off the cycle is when water will come during out the left side.  I put a paper towel down to show it in the attached photo.  This photo was taken mid water dump.  By the time it finishes, the towel is completely wet.I contacted Delonghi and they said it was a bad batch of drip drays that didn't have the proper hole so they shipped me a replacement drip tray.  The whole process of reporting and getting the new drip tray took months thanks to the COVID situation, which I understand.  However; when the new drip tray arrived, the problem persisted.  Now they want me to ship the unit back to them, go without a coffee maker for perhaps months and then wait to get back a unit that hopefully works.  I suspect this is more a design flaw than a lemon so I don't have high expectations.  Why not send me a new unit and then see?Very disappointed in what I thought was a premium band.",One person found this helpful,Yes

If you make coffee by the pot the preparation of coffee using this machine  will change your whole routine, buying habits and time. First you quit using pre ground coffee and you buy whole bean coffee. If you use creamer that stops too, you change to milk. And you find a world of flavoring syrup you will end up using every day to make your Joe. Second you make it by the cup instead the pot. Third it takes 6-15 minutes per cup depending upon how elaborate the preparation. Fourth you have to go through a cleaning process once a month. Fifth you are spending $700 plus to get a contraption that takes up about 3.5 to 4 square feet of counter space.As for this machine in particular we researched and found it to have everything we thought we needed for our first espresso machine. It has been a great piece of equipment. We installed a reverse osmosis unit under our sink to avoid using our local hard tap water ($200). If you have hard tap water use bottled or RO water to extend the life of the machine to avoid scale build up. We have owned it six months and one day it began draining the water from the reservoir into the drip tray. I called The manufacturer and they said there was a new tray design that fixed the problem and said they would send one out in two weeks. A month later we are still waiting for the replacement tray. Machine still works but we have to remove the drip tray to avoid the water tank from being drained into the drip tray.A good purchase from a good company that is slow like any big company....and it still feel like Paris.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

I know a few people who have machines and the grounds make a mess on the counter top. Purchased in August 2019 with three repairs so far so just not a very reliable product.The good: When it works it brews a really nice coffee with nice crema. The integrated grinder and tamper work well.The bad: It breaks quite frequently. The first two times it was under warranty so we got to send it back for free. The first break was a loss of pressure in the device when making a coffee. This decreased the volume output and removed the nice crema from the top. The second time we got a refurbished machine which lasted another six months. Broken thankfully just before the warranty period ended. Most recently the steamer has malfunctioned so instead of frothing milk it only heats the milk. The other major issue with the steamer is instead of a wand they give you a nozzle which lets you change the amount of air allowed to mix with the steam. Well milk gets up the nozzle and really requires taking it off daily and cleaning it. Consider that vs a wand where you only need to turn on the steam function and it clears the line from any milk.

Now I am on the inside looking out .Have a Breville Nespresso Creatista - it has been great - but i wanted to get back to using coffee beans instead of pods.  Nespresso makes the best pods, but $.80 to $1 each pod adds up quick when you need two at a time for strength. I tried the pods where you can used your own grounds, but those don’t produce as well.I roast my own beans and love to experiment with different roasts and coffee beans (honey, pea-berry, wood fire roasted, ....)  which using pods I wasn’t getting to do.I was going to go with Breville Barista, I was waiting for a deal that wasn’t a scam.  And then this machine came along.  After research and comparison videos , it seemed better - due to the built in tamping arm and advanced milk frothing feature. Being a cappuccino man - the froth is important. Would be great if it had the temperature sensor of the Breville creaista - but a digital thermometer will do as work around.Got it all unboxed, cleaned, and produced  a cappuccino within 30 mins, using quick start. Took another 30 mins and read the manual and made a second cappuccino. Suggest reading manual as it has the info on how to change defaults and that you need to do multiple rinses not just one.Get a digital thermometer and a tamp box to go with it.Hope yours gets delivered before 7pm as you maybe wired until late in the night - with the caffeine from the test runs.",4 people found this helpful,Yes

Sep 28, 2019 I just unboxed my Specialista and I am without words. Its heavy. Its steel. Its gorgeous. I mean I read reviews and did my homework on a machine for I don't even know how long. I was set for a long time on the Breville Barista Express for look and price until I fond the DeLonghi La Specialista it all changed and I even coughed up an extra $100 ($599). Reviews were off the charts and espresso results were consistent and inspiring. So simple to set up but hard to keep clean. Every fingerprint is see so you will be constantly wiping it down to keep your baby smiling all day lol.Today 9/29/19 I am going to try to make my first Iced Espresso. I was playing with features and the hot water feature heats it up almost to commercial grade. My biggest thing from making coffee at home is that it doesn't get as hot during the brewing cycle. Already before I even pulled my first shot the water itself was scolding. Ok so my first espresso shot was an absolute fun disaster. OMG you are gonna have fun but waste alot of coffee so don't even think about splurging on an expensive bag keep 2 things in mind: 1) espresso is coffee but supposedly roasted longer and 2) it takes time to perfect the complex nature of expresso or exotic coffees that use other technique that regular brewing lacks.I will be back with an update after I have had a little more experience and see how this machine holds up.*******Update 10/25/19*********This machine is so much fun and delivers cafe quality espresso drinks. Made my first iced caramel latte that I usually pay over $4 for and mine tasted just as good. Super fun and I feel like a barista a few times a week and definitely on weekends. Hard to keep shiny stainless steel clean and it’s not really built to “wing” it on the fly. For example you can skip the built in tamper function if you want to press your own coffee which I want to do sometimes. The tamper light will flash but you can still move through the process. Also don’t try to steam your milk and drip your espresso doesn’t like that. I think it lost pressure I was worried for a minute. Otherwise it outperforms my expectations and a real conversation starter. It just looks so much better than the Breville.",One person found this helpful,Yes

There were two issues with the manual espresso machines: 1) The whole kitchen got messy no matter how often we cleaned 2) To get a consistent espresso shot in the morning rush was too difficult. Fully automatic ones were very convenient and kept our countertop clean, however they lacked flavor no matter what we tried. This Delonghi is a good hybrid. It is very easy to get consistent shots and our countertop stays clean. The machine will adjust the amount/granularity of the grind and will produce consistent shots. No learning curve.

We checked it over and made sure that the seal from the water dispenser was making contact, but it still leaked. Now for the disappointments. Although we had the grind value down to the very lowest, we could not get the pressure gauge to read in the acceptable area. The taste wasn't bad tho and the crema was pretty good. It was also good at making an Americano which my husband likes. One thing that really bugged me was the the milk steam only runs for one minute and then quits. The only way I could get the temperature up to 140 was by resetting the steam. It did froth well, but I never did get a hot latte.  The automatic tamper worked so well that it was almost impossible to get the used grinds out of it. Forget using the Knock Box. Also the cup warming feature is useless.

Here's why, or at least here's what happened to me. Within two months of getting this very nice, very expensive machine, the grinder stopped working. I tried to get a replacement from DeLonghi, but DeLonghi doesn't recognize this seller as an official retailer so they wouldn't honor my request for a replacement piece. The seller would replace or refund if I would mail them the machine back, which would have been super expensive. The machine is obviously heavy. At the time, I chose to live with the machine since it was still half working. Today, the entire machine stopped working. It turns on but won't do anything else. All of its functions have ceased to work. So, DeLonghi machines, no matter who you buy them from, are lemons. At least mine is. DeLonghi, the company, won't stand by their manufacturing. The seller here would not make refunds or replacements realistic and absolutely not easy. Amazon is at fault here too, in my opinion. They should not let unauthorized sellers sell anything that would jeopardize a return,  refund, or warranty. At all. Ever. That's just shady. I hope you find a great espresso machine from a reputable company.  My DeLonghi was great while it lasted but I'd never spend a dime on something that didn't even last 10 months. Good luck. UPDATE: One day after posting this review, I was contacted by DeLonghi and was told that they would indeed honor the warranty.  They provided me with a packing box and packing slip (at their expense) to ship my broken machine off to be repaired. Which it was!!! The machine was repaired and returned to me. I love my machine and the coffees it makes. I kinda wish they would have honored the warranty the first go-round, but at the end of the day, I am glad DeLonghi did the right thing.",N/A,Yes

I am, however, quite the Starbucks lover. I am married to an ex-barista who is quite the snob about drinking coffee at home. I am not as picky, but I know a good cup of coffee when I have one in front of me. I figured between the two of our tastes and experiences that we could provide a well-rounded review. Setup was fairly simple. After yelling at my husband to read the instructions for the fifth time, it got cleaned & put together in about 20 minutes. This machine does not include the water softener filter so if you deal with hard water, plan to buy one in addition to the price of this machine. We’ve made two drinks so far and both have been amazing. We’ve made an iced caramel macchiato and a vanilla latte. The flavor is strong and brewed just right. Even for me, with no experience working an espresso machine, it was easy enough to figure out. Prep, brew, & clean up time took a total of 6 minutes from whole beans in the grinder to finished grinds in the trash. To compare to how much you’re spending on coffee already, when broken into daily payments over a year, it ends up being about $2.05. Way less than a grande or vente Starbucks drink price and according to the hubs way better in taste! I spent maybe $15 on Starbucks coffee beans, more almond milk, and some caramel drizzle that will last me over a month. Although it’s a lump sum in the beginning, you will be glad you made the investment. This machine is well worth it.UPDATE ON 8-11-19:I’m updating my review to add a few very important notes that I have learned since I posted my original review:1. Any coffee beans are “espresso” beans. This is probably basic knowledge to some, but I didn’t know that! I spent a good 30 minutes in publix looking for “espresso” beans. Lol.. live & learn.2. Watch all the YouTube videos! Making the perfect shot of espresso takes practice. I went to Costco & bought a big bag of beans and made about twenty shots just trying to perfect my skill!3. Only put the beans in the grinder before you go to make a cup. It makes for a much fresher tasting espresso.4. If you’re going to be making lots of espresso, invest in a good set of espresso glasses. I originally was using a stainless steel shot glass I had and my finger tips about burned off! I ordered JoyJolt double walled espresso glasses (the 2 oz ones) on Amazon and they have been a lovey addition to my morning espresso routine.5. The machine will stop grinding depending on where you turn the knob. I have found for a single shot of espresso, turning the grinder knob to the center and just a tad to the left that it makes the perfect amount for a great shot of espresso.6. The closer the espresso glass is to where the espresso is coming out is important! It creates a thicker level of crema.That’s about all I can think of right now. It truly is an amazing machine and I have enjoyed waking up knowing I get to go downstairs to this bad boy.",500 people found this helpful,No

Buyer Beware!,"If you are considering getting this machine... read on so you have a sense of what to expect.  If you have already, I sincerely hope your experience is better than ours.We have had this machine for about a year and a half.  About 4 months ago, the grinder stopped working.  It took me 40 min to get a hold of some one @ DeLonghi to get a repair (neve rmind online, where they promise a reply within 2 business days and I did not get any reply for over a month!).They did honor the 2 year warranty and repaired it at no charge... except that it took weeks to even get the box/paper work to send it to them and a couple of weeks to get it back (the latter, honestly, I was ok with).We have had it back now for about a month... and this morning it stopped working... again!  Now the computer thinks the water tank is empty (it is not, and we have inserted/re-inserted the tank several times), and wants to run the set up program (which we have run 4-5 times already)... to no avail!I am incredibly frustrated!  This was not a cheap item.  This was $800 and I would have expected better quality and better customer service.  I am at a loss. I was hoping for a better experience.  Now, I am back to my trusty coffee pot on the stove... until I figure something out.Still here are some comments I have for you to consider about the machine itself.What I love...It is relatively easy to set up and use... almost foolproof!It heats up quicklyIt is quieter than othersLots of features to make different drinks easilyFoams milk like a dreamThe tamping feature is really cool!  It helps control the mess and keep things tidy!But...There are several design “flaws”  you should be aware of...It is a tall machine... we have it under the upper cabinets and to get it in and out we have to take off the coffee bean hopper lidI absolutely dislike the fact you cannot take the hopper off when it is full of beans.  So, you are “stuck” with whatever beans you put in.  Other machines I have had lock the beans in and you can remove the hopper and the beans if you desire to change the coffee... which we do!It has only 6 grinder settings... we have it set one notch above the finest grind setting and we still are not getting the intensity of flavor we were used to get with other machines.

The most popular high end machine for making espresso at home has been the Breville Barista Express.  But that machine has a high learning curve.  Just learning to choose the right grind size from the many available options or consistently tamping the grounds with the right amount of pressure takes a lot of practice (and wasted coffee).  Not to mention learning to use the steam wand properly for milk based drinks.  You can spend about 4 times as much as the Breville would cost you to buy a superautomatic machine that makes really good espresso, such as the various Jura models.  Or you could spend just a little more money than the Breville and buy a machine like this new De'Longhi La Specialista Prestigio espresso machine, which automates some of the steps that are hard to master but still allows you more control over the process than a superautomatic machine would.  This De'Longhi only offers 6 choices for grind size, but with the built in sensor grinding technology, you don't need to be as precise when dialing in the grid size as you would need to be with a less advanced machine.  But perhaps the most useful feature of this machine is the smart tamping feature, which takes care of using just the right amount of pressure to tamp the grounds so you don't need to worry about that.  So whether you are a beginner or an expert when it comes to making your own espresso, you will always get more consistent results with this machine.  The steam wand is improved over previous De'Longhi models, but it does take a while to master the skill of using it to make really good lattes and cappuccinos.  However, after a little practice it didn't take me long to get much better results than I have been able to get with any other espresso machine I have used.  Overall this is a very nice machine, and probably the best value in a home espresso machine for under $1,000 that you will find anywhere.",61 people found this helpful,No

I love making mochas and capuchinos, but I have such a hard time trying to frothing and texturizing the milk to the creamer consistency to make lattes. With the Breville this process was a breeze.

I did find a technique were I’m able to get the cream with this one to make my lattes, unfortunately it has been a 50/50 right outcome.

My last was a Breville Oracle that finally died after 3 years.  In deciding what to replace it with I evaluated what I wanted to use it for.  For the last few years I only drink Americanos and to a lesser extent, Lattes.  So I wasn’t looking for an espresso machine to produce god shots for drinking straight espresso, but something more than good enough to produce excellent Americanos and Lattes.  The La Specialista met that quite well.It is easy to use and since I was well experienced with espresso making, dialing it in to produce great coffee was quick and easy.  From power on to ready to use is about a minute.  Then I do a blind shot to heat up the portafilter as a cold portafilter will negatively affect the espresso produced.  I leave the empty portafilter in the machine and use the Rinse button to get the preheat done.  Grinding works well as does the built in tamping with a side effect of not being as messy as using a separate grinder with a tamper often is.  One concern with the grinder is that to make good espresso the grind setting needs to be very close to the minimum grind size and over time, as the grinder burrs wear that will probably become an issue.  Fortunately DeLonghi sells a replacement upper burr for that very issue.Steaming excellent and nearly automatic for Lattes or Flat Whites, but I think it is a little weak for a cappuccino.  Cleaning of the steam wand is dead simple and since the wand is a no-burn type, cleaning off the outside is easy too.The various button combinations for changing some default settings work well and are well documented in the user manual.  The First Start pamphlet is excellent and well presented so getting the machines ready for that first use is really easy.",26 people found this helpful,Yes

The previous one was a Krupps fully automatic machine, made really good coffee but like all machines do at some point, it decided to die.There are quite a few machines in the $1200+ range and a few in the $600-1200 range, which is the price range I was looking at. I had short-listed to Gaggia vs Philips, leaning more towards Gaggia but reports of their poor customer service was disconcerting. Both of these are fully automatic. De'Longhi had the semi-automatic Magnifica but it didn't look pleasing aesthetically as far as matching the rest of my kitchen goes. Breville seemed a little too much work with manual tamping - as in, you actually take the tamper and press into the portafilter to tamp.Almost as I was finally ready to buy, I see this De'Longhi - la specialista. I have had this machine for about two weeks now.It is a semi-automatic machine. Its not a press-one-button-and-get-coffee machine, you will have to do some, a little, bit of work. Meaning, attach the portafilter to the grind unit and then the brew unit. Not a lot of work, and it actually feels good to be doing that!!Build quality is really really good. I am hard pressed to tell plastic from steel parts. Sides have the brushed steel look and chrome trims and I have no idea what is plastic. A very solid, well built machine. It looks really really good sitting on the counter, especially with that black 'dashboard' with the pressure gauge dominating the facade. The portafilter is solid and surprisingly heavy - you could easily use it for defense in case of burglary or something !! Same solid build is seen also in the included frothing mug and the filters, as well as the steel drip tray grill. Rest of the drip tray is plastic - the one place where plastic is obviously plastic.Power button turns it on of course - there's a master on/off switch in the back. Also in the back is a water reservoir which is surprisingly large.Attaching the portafilter to the grinder starts the grinding automatically. The machine will grind coffee for one or two shots if you press the 2x button.This is where my only frustration with the machine arose - frustration that has since been resolved. Start with factory default settings - fineness at 3 and amount of coffee dial at about 10 o'clock position. I was too impatient and started playing with the dials causing the machine to grind EXCESSIVE amounts of coffee and essentially malfunction. Ground coffee would back up the discharge chute from the grinder resulting in unhappy sounds from the machine and unhappy time for me.De'Longhi uses an ""exclusive"" new technology / sensor to determine how much coffee to grind. I think the common method is to grind for a certain amount of time. This machine detects the actual amount ground - I think. Anyway, I think this sensor is located in the chute which can be accessed by popping up a small flap located right at the base of the bean hopper. Using the provided brush tool, and a thin plastic stick, I unclogged this chute and cleaned out as much coffee grounds as I could. Problem solved. But it did take about half a bag of beans before getting that resolved.I blame the above on the fact that this is our first semi-automatic machine. There is a learning curve.Now that the vulnerable part is identified and addressed, the machine has been working without any issues whatsoever. I am actually coffee-making, barista style, on this thing. Coffee tastes really really good. Unlike the Breville, this one has a built in tamper - handle on the left side of the machine in the product photos. Once you attach the portafilter, the machine will automatically grind the dosed amount of coffee. Pull the handle down to tamp - there's a mark to tell you how much to pull. Remove the portafilter, attach it to the brewing station and press OK button. And you have your coffee.The built in milk frother / steam wand works really well too. The frother has a dedicated heating unit, separate from the brew unity. It has a 'flat' and 'foam' function. I tried both and really enjoy the foamed steamed milk. After watching a few YouTube videos, I learned to hold the included frothing mug at a certain angle and move it in circular motion etc but then discovered that the machine does a really fine job without those shenanigans. Just set the mug on the corner of the drip tray, stick the want in there and turn the dial for steaming. You get a luxurious micro froth without doing the dance I described. And the steam stops automatically. If you like your coffee actually hot though, you will have to do the steam twice. There is a function to increase the temperature of the coffee but I have not played with that setting so far.The cons are very few. Coming from a fully automatic machine, I had a to learn to use a semi-automatic one but that should be expected of any new tool / machine. The machine is full enclosed and does NOT have the easily removable brew unit that some manufacturers highlight, including DeLonghi. That might be an issue further down the road, but DeLonghi Magnifica and Breville don't have that feature as well and don't seem to be suffering as a result.Overall, I am really pleased with the machine. Great build quality, great coffee. Happy with the purchase.",16 people found this helpful,Yes

EASY FIX! I am sharing this to avoid returns and waits. I called De'longhi and they were absolutely no help! They actually told me to just take the tank off after each use to prevent leakage!!! Um no, that doesn't fix the problem people!!  So I was ready to return the unit but decided to check things out on my own. Here was my discovery...On the back of the machine under the water tank (take tank off) there is a clear star shaped gasket that regulates the flow of water into the machine.  Gently rock the valve with your finger until you feel it lay flat. Do this even if it appears to be flat already. It seems to reset the flow. Fixed my problem! I think it is caused my pressure build up? Hope this helps others with leaking issues.We have been using this now for two weeks. LOVE IT! As a former barista I would highly recommend this machine as it is pretty self explanatory. A few things we didn’t like of the top was the awkward placement of the water tank. It’s a bit difficult to put water in from a pitcher or jug. Recommend using a tumbler or a glass if it’s stored under cabinets. Another issue we had with the unboxing was we couldn’t get the grinder to operate. That was due to not twisting the dome on hard enough ( I was afraid of breaking the plastic) but it’s tougher than one would expect. The frother wand should be dissembled and cleaned after each use or fill a cup with water and run the air through to make sure the inner nipple is clean. No water leakage as others have mentioned in their comments. All and all we are very happy with our purchase. Brews a great espresso and americano. The more you use it the more comfortable you will become with the functions. I highly recommend buying the knock box and espresso shot glasses!",10 people found this helpful,Yes

We haven’t had any of the maintenance problems other users have had. I haven’t seen any reviews here from an “unwilling” household member, so I wanted to post this. We have had the same automatic drip coffee maker for over 10 years, so this was a serious upgrade for us. As a guy who “just wants a cup of coffee” in the morning, I was very skeptical that I could grow to love this machine. We have limited counter space and so didn’t want to have both. But my wife promised she’d make the coffee every morning, so I consented. Her promise lasted about two months, so indeed I was stuck using the machine as expected (and making hers as well)! Now I drink cappuccino every morning, because the taste is better than coffee (Americano) and it takes the same amount of time. That’s my chief complaint with this machine, the active time spent using it. You can't set it to be ready when you wake up, and the operation is active; you can't just push a button and walk away. So my experience is not in comparison to any other espresso maker, but compared to a “normal coffee maker.”I also wanted to share a few tips to getting the time down from 8 minutes to 4 minutes including clean up. This is for people who have been using the machine for a few months so you know what I’m talking about.1. Use the shelf of the machine for the milk foaming. If you use enough milk (we use heavy cream/almond milk), the steamer tube will reach into the milk while in the included steel “pitcher”. I have found no difference in milk/foam consistency if I stir the milk around or just let it sit. I use this time (usually takes 2 steam cycles) to empty out the grounds and clean up the filter holder.2. I use a small metal spoon to clean out the grounds from the filter rather than banging it, which has been faster and makes less of a mess. I’ve been doing this for the past 4 months and have not noticed any scrapes to the filter or filter cup. The sooner you do this after use the easier it is.3. We remove and rinse the filter after each use. This was very annoying for me as I have big fingers and it’s nearly impossible to grip the tiny rubber tab to pull the filter out. Then my wife showed me a trick: just use a small corner torn off from a paper towel to pull the tab. It gives you just enough grip to easily pull out the filter, and works every time.I clean the filter and cup while the milk is foaming and this has made coffee making into only a minor annoyance rather than the serious one it was before.My other complaint is the noise that the foamer makes. Surprisingly, the way that you orient/tilt the milk pitcher makes a big difference. Play around with it until the noise is reduced. I used to wake up the whole house with what I would call the “shrieking beasts of hell”, but now they have mostly been tamed.Overall, I’m happy with the purchase, but it took some getting used to.PS:  In case anyone is wondering, each steam cycle adds about 30ml of water to your beverage. I weighed the milk pitcher before and after steaming. Yes, I'm a nerd.",9 people found this helpful,Yes

Just did my second descaling, no problems.  Still very happy and my wife loves every cup I make for her (of course she does!).  No leakage, remember to keep the portafilter inserts clean!Original review: This is a nice looking machine, and after three weeks I cannot say it has any problems at all.  I dialed in the grind (set at 2 and about 5/8 of full dial setting) and used some 20 dollar Lavazza Blu/Oro beans, the coffee was amazing.  The crema is quite good, it would be better if the head was heated by water like others, but run a hot water preheat before you start brewing.  Try to warm the cup too, will hold the crema longer.  For the price, this is quite good.  The steam heater works well, if you put an inch and a half of milk in the provided pitcher, the sixty second steam cycle is sufficient, but use a thermometer anyway, it is best gage of readiness and they cost about 10 bucks with the clip.  I believe cleaning is most important thing about these machines, blow out the steam tube, clean the steam wand, disassemble it and wipe the rubber tube after you're done with it for the time of day.  Use filtered water, this is not a FAEMA or professional machine, it will help you keep the pump and piping cleaner longer.  Don't let coffee get stale in the hopper, just put what you need for a few days at most.  Clean between the two disks of the portafilter, and rinse it out too.One thing that happened once is that a suction developed in the water line, not sure but seems like a check or stop valve got cycled by an air bubble.  I stopped the cycle when the trouble lights appeared, lifted and reseated the tank, and it burped when I restarted the cycle.  D'longhi should look into that, it might be a reason others have had problems with the water-out lights coming on.All said, having this quality of espresso at home is a wonderful thing, beats starbucks by a long shot.  If you want flavorings look up Torani syrups, I bought some for an occasional twist when I want it.  I will update if I have any other news on my experiences with this machine.  I think it is a good purchase so far.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

I mainly make lattes and americanos with the occasional cappuccino. I think Starbucks drinks are just ok, not good or great.  I purchased this De'Longhi La Specialista to replace a Breville 870. The advertised La Specialista dimensions don't accurately indicate just how big this machine is. With the grinder hopper attached, the actual height is about 17.5 inches and with the poorly designed power cord attached the depth is 16 inches. Lots of counter space is needed. The design of the built in tamper and grinder chute make getting the correct grind and tamp more difficult than necessary due to not being able to see how much coffee is being dispensed and feeling the tamp pressure. This process is an important part of pulling a good espresso shot. Only pressurized filters are provided. Once the grind and tamp are set as best as possible the resulting shots are only mediocre. The pucks are a mess, often not releasing from the filter causing the filter to drop out of the portafilter into the knock box and the puck needing to be scooped out of the filter.  The water reservoir is hidden on the sides so the water level can only be seen from the back of the machine. The steam wand is actually comprised of two pieces and milk goes up into the tubes requiring both pieces be removed and cleaned after each use. This is an easy process but I question how well the wand will hold up over time with this daily removal. Beans must be removed from the hopper prior to removing the hopper as there is no closing mechanism to hold the beans in the hopper. These issues are unacceptable for a machine at this price point. Now the pros; this is a good looking machine and is quiet, the steam wand does work well, easily frothing milk, and the warm up time is very quick. This machine makes better coffee drinks than a drip or pod coffee maker but isn't as good as other options in this price range. I returned mine and purchased another 870.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

The Specialista is attractive and seems well-made. However, I am disappointed in the Specialista in several ways and regret buying it instead of having my Breville fixed:1. The setting of the grinder is not consistent and difficult to adjust, especially at the finest grind settings.2. The milk foamer (expander) does not make higher density foam that I was used to with the Breville (manual) steamer and it is too easy to bump the wand into its ""flat"" setting3. The portaflter is deep and not very wide so I have great difficulty emptying the used grounds into a ""bang box."" I have to use a tool every time; which is very messy. I never had that problem with the Breville portafilter with its different aspect ratio.4. The very small holes in the portafilter tend to get clogged and they are difficult to clean.5.

What’s not to love?Namely, the descaling process. We have had this unit for about 3.25 months and have descaled it twice. Descaling is a process that removes hard water mineral build up from the sensitive components inside the espresso maker.

I ended up choosing this over a similar Breville machine because of the additional hot water spout. I was initially apprehensive about the price, but now I don't know how I waited so long to get one of these. The only problem now is that I want to drink coffee all day!The machine is super easy to use, yet it's fun to operate and you feel like a professional barista. You get your coffee as fast as you would from a pod machine, but it tastes like you got it at a coffee shop. Once the machine is set up (not difficult), brewing a coffee is as simple as:1. Attach the filter to the grinder. The correct amount of beans will grind automatically.2. Tamp the grounds with the lever.3. Attach the filter to the brewer and place a cup underneath.4. Select your drink and hit OK.There are some great features that make it easy to create the full range of coffee shop drinks:* You can easily grind and brew 1 or 2 shots. Filters are provided for both sizes.* You can select espresso, Americano (espresso + hot water), or ""coffee"" (AKA a lungo), and the machine applies the correct amount of water and brewing time.* A separate button will provide hot water only, making this the easiest way to brew tea.* There is a wand that can froth or steam milk so you can make cappuccinos and lattes.I initially thought the coffee was not hot enough, but I checked the manual and found a setting to use a higher water temperature. There is also a bit of trial and error to set the grinder to get exactly the right ""dosage"" of grounds per shot, but once you have that dialed in, you don't have to worry about it again for a long time.In conclusion, this is a great machine and I'm so glad I bought it. I can think of very few purchases where I was just as excited to use the thing weeks after I got it, and this is one of them.PS.

I think DeLonghi tried to compete with Breville all-in-one machine and this attempt failed. They tried to couple their EC680M cheap machine with a grinder and the grinder is terrible. First, you need to grind always to the finest setting, and it is not fine enough. The beverage is sour (underextracted). the grinder has only 6 settings (a joke? only 6?) and they are all useless, since you need to set it to 1. And the espresso is not good. They tried to fix this problem by replacing regular baskets with pressurized baskets (they are more forgiving), but it means it is NOT espresso. Pressurized = bad. The tamper is a joke.When you brew espresso, the gauge in front of the machine NEVER shows the optimal zone. Never! Watch some youtube videos, never. I saw just one video, where the zone shown was optimal, but the guy used much more beans, filling the basket well above the limit.Verdict: it is not just a machine that is not as good as the others. The whole design is flawed, the machine simply does not work. I got it as a gift to friends in Taipei, so I cannot ship from there and  return.$799 just wasted. DeLonghi, have conscience! Return money! And fire all the designers.Google, there is a video, where a guy in France found a solution.

So now we’re left without the machine for a second time.6/4: UPDATEReceived our third unit. This one is a certified refurbished one to replace the new one we bought that didn’t last very long. I can’t say if it works or not, as the water tank it was shipped with is cracked and broken .... DeLonghi is closed, so I’ll have to call tomorrow.Update: Our certified refurbished machine no longer works. It turns on and then shuts off. Numerous calls to Delonghi with promises of call backs which never came. Finally was able to get them to agree to refund me my money. Although they say it can take 4-6 weeks. I was offered a brand new replacement machine, but their lack of follow through and going through three returns isn’t worth it.I’d stay away from this machine.",One person found this helpful,Yes

Arrived quickly and all was well as I learned how the machine worked which, truth be told, took a bit of a learning curve. I sough help from De'Longhi because it was almost impossible to get the puck out of the filter holder.  I eventually learned to live with that.  I reduced the coffee amount and slightly increased the grind and that helped some but it still was difficult.  Then, the grinder stopped working.  I worked with De'Longhi to resolve and was unable to get it working.  At this point I was told they would send me a box so I could return it and they would fix it and send it back to me.  I had missed Christmas Eve and Christmas day coffee with my family and was unhappy at the prospect of weeks without my espresso machine.  So, I called Amazon on Friday, explained my situation, and had a new machine on my doorstep Monday morning!  Technically, my 30 day Amazon return window had closed, but after hearing my story, customer service came through!In the meantime, the DeLonghi box never arrived.  I did get a phone call from them about a week after I received my new machine telling me how sorry they were that my problem had fallen through a crack in the system.  So, I guess I should be hopeful that the 2 year warranty on the machine will be honored.  Still, cant thank Amazon enough.BTW:  the new machine is amazing.  Makes amazing espresso (for me) and Americanos (for my husband) and the milk frother is outstanding.  Once you have it down, it can't be beat!",2 people found this helpful,Yes

The footprint is not too bad and my wife will maybe let me bring it in the house instead of my office.  I think I'll keep it close to me. :)Update:  Two weeks after setting this up and only a handful of coffees I started noticing that the countertop had water on it after use.  At first, I thought it was from cleaning up around the unit or it settling in.  Boy was I wrong.  This unit leaks a significant amount of water all the time, but its haphazard as to when.There is definitely a design flaw someplace. I notice it most after doing a couple of cups back to back, but it can also happen with a single cup.  I typically will froth some milk and then make a couple of cups of Americano to use with the milk.  If I stop the Americano short of the full cycle or stop the frothing after the machine warms up, I notice the water the most.  Typically right after shutting off the cycle is when water will come during out the left side.  I put a paper towel down to show it in the attached photo.  This photo was taken mid water dump.  By the time it finishes, the towel is completely wet.I contacted Delonghi and they said it was a bad batch of drip drays that didn't have the proper hole so they shipped me a replacement drip tray.  The whole process of reporting and getting the new drip tray took months thanks to the COVID situation, which I understand.  However; when the new drip tray arrived, the problem persisted.  Now they want me to ship the unit back to them, go without a coffee maker for perhaps months and then wait to get back a unit that hopefully works.  I suspect this is more a design flaw than a lemon so I don't have high expectations.  Why not send me a new unit and then see?Very disappointed in what I thought was a premium band.",One person found this helpful,Yes

If you make coffee by the pot the preparation of coffee using this machine  will change your whole routine, buying habits and time. First you quit using pre ground coffee and you buy whole bean coffee. If you use creamer that stops too, you change to milk. And you find a world of flavoring syrup you will end up using every day to make your Joe. Second you make it by the cup instead the pot. Third it takes 6-15 minutes per cup depending upon how elaborate the preparation. Fourth you have to go through a cleaning process once a month. Fifth you are spending $700 plus to get a contraption that takes up about 3.5 to 4 square feet of counter space.As for this machine in particular we researched and found it to have everything we thought we needed for our first espresso machine. It has been a great piece of equipment. We installed a reverse osmosis unit under our sink to avoid using our local hard tap water ($200). If you have hard tap water use bottled or RO water to extend the life of the machine to avoid scale build up. We have owned it six months and one day it began draining the water from the reservoir into the drip tray. I called The manufacturer and they said there was a new tray design that fixed the problem and said they would send one out in two weeks. A month later we are still waiting for the replacement tray. Machine still works but we have to remove the drip tray to avoid the water tank from being drained into the drip tray.A good purchase from a good company that is slow like any big company....and it still feel like Paris.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

I know a few people who have machines and the grounds make a mess on the counter top. Purchased in August 2019 with three repairs so far so just not a very reliable product.The good: When it works it brews a really nice coffee with nice crema. The integrated grinder and tamper work well.The bad: It breaks quite frequently. The first two times it was under warranty so we got to send it back for free. The first break was a loss of pressure in the device when making a coffee. This decreased the volume output and removed the nice crema from the top. The second time we got a refurbished machine which lasted another six months. Broken thankfully just before the warranty period ended. Most recently the steamer has malfunctioned so instead of frothing milk it only heats the milk. The other major issue with the steamer is instead of a wand they give you a nozzle which lets you change the amount of air allowed to mix with the steam. Well milk gets up the nozzle and really requires taking it off daily and cleaning it. Consider that vs a wand where you only need to turn on the steam function and it clears the line from any milk.

The only way I can get higher pressure is to fill portfilter to a level slightly higher than the horizontal line but, if you filled it too high you won’t be able to close it.- The Drip tray fills up very quickly and you need to remember to empty it or you will have water on your counter.  There is a rubber floater that is supposed to indicate high water level but it was not discussed in the manual.- The perforated screen inside the portfilter should be pulled out for cleaning but it is difficult  to remove.-  overall the machine is easy to use with all the indicators in the front panel.  It is nice that you don’t need separate grinder and tamper which saves a lot of counter space. Making Expresso is easy but  I am still working on my latte skills.  Sometimes I get a blob of foam on the top and other times I get no foams.A note after two months of use:  I am really happy with the purchase I made.  The expresso taste very good after I adjusted the water temperature to high and the double walled glass helps keep the drink hot longer.

The Breville lower burr has a nut so the lower burr removal is simple and easy. Di’ Longhi customer service is awful to say the least. I’m a 1 cup a day user.

Now I am on the inside looking out .Have a Breville Nespresso Creatista - it has been great - but i wanted to get back to using coffee beans instead of pods.  Nespresso makes the best pods, but $.80 to $1 each pod adds up quick when you need two at a time for strength. I tried the pods where you can used your own grounds, but those don’t produce as well.I roast my own beans and love to experiment with different roasts and coffee beans (honey, pea-berry, wood fire roasted, ....)  which using pods I wasn’t getting to do.I was going to go with Breville Barista, I was waiting for a deal that wasn’t a scam.  And then this machine came along.  After research and comparison videos , it seemed better - due to the built in tamping arm and advanced milk frothing feature. Being a cappuccino man - the froth is important. Would be great if it had the temperature sensor of the Breville creaista - but a digital thermometer will do as work around.Got it all unboxed, cleaned, and produced  a cappuccino within 30 mins, using quick start. Took another 30 mins and read the manual and made a second cappuccino. Suggest reading manual as it has the info on how to change defaults and that you need to do multiple rinses not just one.Get a digital thermometer and a tamp box to go with it.Hope yours gets delivered before 7pm as you maybe wired until late in the night - with the caffeine from the test runs.",4 people found this helpful,Yes

Sep 28, 2019 I just unboxed my Specialista and I am without words. Its heavy. Its steel. Its gorgeous. I mean I read reviews and did my homework on a machine for I don't even know how long. I was set for a long time on the Breville Barista Express for look and price until I fond the DeLonghi La Specialista it all changed and I even coughed up an extra $100 ($599). Reviews were off the charts and espresso results were consistent and inspiring. So simple to set up but hard to keep clean. Every fingerprint is see so you will be constantly wiping it down to keep your baby smiling all day lol.Today 9/29/19 I am going to try to make my first Iced Espresso. I was playing with features and the hot water feature heats it up almost to commercial grade. My biggest thing from making coffee at home is that it doesn't get as hot during the brewing cycle. Already before I even pulled my first shot the water itself was scolding. Ok so my first espresso shot was an absolute fun disaster. OMG you are gonna have fun but waste alot of coffee so don't even think about splurging on an expensive bag keep 2 things in mind: 1) espresso is coffee but supposedly roasted longer and 2) it takes time to perfect the complex nature of expresso or exotic coffees that use other technique that regular brewing lacks.I will be back with an update after I have had a little more experience and see how this machine holds up.*******Update 10/25/19*********This machine is so much fun and delivers cafe quality espresso drinks. Made my first iced caramel latte that I usually pay over $4 for and mine tasted just as good. Super fun and I feel like a barista a few times a week and definitely on weekends. Hard to keep shiny stainless steel clean and it’s not really built to “wing” it on the fly. For example you can skip the built in tamper function if you want to press your own coffee which I want to do sometimes. The tamper light will flash but you can still move through the process. Also don’t try to steam your milk and drip your espresso doesn’t like that. I think it lost pressure I was worried for a minute. Otherwise it outperforms my expectations and a real conversation starter. It just looks so much better than the Breville.",One person found this helpful,Yes

Fully automatic ones were very convenient and kept our countertop clean, however they lacked flavor no matter what we tried. This Delonghi is a good hybrid.

We checked it over and made sure that the seal from the water dispenser was making contact, but it still leaked. Now for the disappointments. Although we had the grind value down to the very lowest, we could not get the pressure gauge to read in the acceptable area. The taste wasn't bad tho and the crema was pretty good. It was also good at making an Americano which my husband likes. One thing that really bugged me was the the milk steam only runs for one minute and then quits. The only way I could get the temperature up to 140 was by resetting the steam. It did froth well, but I never did get a hot latte.  The automatic tamper worked so well that it was almost impossible to get the used grinds out of it. Forget using the Knock Box. Also the cup warming feature is useless.

Here's why, or at least here's what happened to me. Within two months of getting this very nice, very expensive machine, the grinder stopped working. I tried to get a replacement from DeLonghi, but DeLonghi doesn't recognize this seller as an official retailer so they wouldn't honor my request for a replacement piece. The seller would replace or refund if I would mail them the machine back, which would have been super expensive. The machine is obviously heavy. At the time, I chose to live with the machine since it was still half working. Today, the entire machine stopped working. It turns on but won't do anything else. All of its functions have ceased to work. So, DeLonghi machines, no matter who you buy them from, are lemons. At least mine is. DeLonghi, the company, won't stand by their manufacturing. The seller here would not make refunds or replacements realistic and absolutely not easy. Amazon is at fault here too, in my opinion. They should not let unauthorized sellers sell anything that would jeopardize a return,  refund, or warranty. At all. Ever. That's just shady. I hope you find a great espresso machine from a reputable company.  My DeLonghi was great while it lasted but I'd never spend a dime on something that didn't even last 10 months. Good luck. UPDATE: One day after posting this review, I was contacted by DeLonghi and was told that they would indeed honor the warranty.  They provided me with a packing box and packing slip (at their expense) to ship my broken machine off to be repaired. Which it was!!! The machine was repaired and returned to me. I love my machine and the coffees it makes. I kinda wish they would have honored the warranty the first go-round, but at the end of the day, I am glad DeLonghi did the right thing.",N/A,Yes

The only way I can get higher pressure is to fill portfilter to a level slightly higher than the horizontal line but, if you filled it too high you won’t be able to close it.- The Drip tray fills up very quickly and you need to remember to empty it or you will have water on your counter.  There is a rubber floater that is supposed to indicate high water level but it was not discussed in the manual.- The perforated screen inside the portfilter should be pulled out for cleaning but it is difficult  to remove.-  overall the machine is easy to use with all the indicators in the front panel.  It is nice that you don’t need separate grinder and tamper which saves a lot of counter space. Making Expresso is easy but  I am still working on my latte skills.  Sometimes I get a blob of foam on the top and other times I get no foams.A note after two months of use:  I am really happy with the purchase I made.

What is easy about this machine is that there is no mess or muss w the grinds spilling out, or wondering if i'm tamping with the adequate pressure or if i'm tamping at an angle, etc... since most of those variables are accounted for and taken out of the picture with the automated grind/tamp system in this machine. I think this machine allows aspiring amateurs like myself to get a better espresso with control over a few variables such as general heat, broad grind size, and water amount, without having to be an expert at grind preparation and tamping, controlling pressure directly or having an exact PID temperature controller. Altho this machine has a secondary milk heating system, it is not a true dual boiler, since you can't froth and pull a shot at the same time. But the delay is a bit shorter between shot and milk heat up with this machine. The plus with the ease of using this machine is that even my espresso-machine-phobic husband was willing to move the portafilter from the grind area to the group head and press the ""ok"" button to get a shot.The pics show me using the single shot (they provide the non-pressurized only) basket, and dark roasted (big box store) Guatemalan Arabica beans on the ""2"" fine grind level w a dosage dialed to the line in the tamped filter, and a 2 ""bar"" out of 3 heat setting.  I tried to use the instruction manual's suggested 1 bar heat setting and a ""5"" grind coarseness for dark roast coffees originally, but this gave me a weak and runny espresso.Although not shown, i also used a timer scale for a few pulls, just to check out what I was getting out. What I'm finding is that, at least with the beans I'm currently using, I can fit about 13g of coffee in the basket, and i'm getting about 35 g espresso out in a fast 12 seconds, w the pressure guage going to about the 11 o'clock region at the height. I tried to slow this down by using more coffee and a finer grind, but that did not work as well (basket got stuck, espresso did not taste as good)....so, i'm kinda wondering if i'm doing something wrong, but, ""2"" grind level as is, and 12 seconds tastes pretty good. i'll mess around with this more when i get to a different bean. I recently had also read about ""turbo"" shots that provide better extraction at relatively coarser grinds and faster speeds - such as my 12 sec, at a 1:2 or 1:3 grinds to espresso ratio being ideal for extraction, but that's a whole other controversy apparently. All I can say is that my espresso through this machine at the settings noted is flavorful, not bitter, bright tasting and yummy in general.I am having a big learning curve with the 3 hole milk frother wand tho, and it's been kinda challenging in comparison to the 1 hole wand i'm used to. Still, I made a decent looking froth at least for the pics shown.Overall, I'm liking this machine because I have some control of my espresso results, but my  non-caring-about-making-espresso-just-wanna-drink-it-now-can-u-just-make-it-for-me husband can pretty much make one too.  The resulting espresso is really tasty, and ultimately, that's what an espresso machine is for, i figure.",10 people found this helpful,No

It just upped the class of the whole room. My poor fridge has already developed an inferiority complex, and let's not even talk about my cheap drip coffeemaker!The machine was packaged really well in the large box. I was glad two of us were there to pull the lighter-weight box out of the heavyweight box, because it fit so snugly. I was also glad two of us were there to pull the styrofoam-encased machine out, and I was glad one of us (not me) was strong enough to feel confident taking it out and placing it on the countertop. This thing is quite heavy, because it's made out of lots of metal components that, from what I can tell, are high quality.While the espresso maker would fit underneath my cabinets, I wouldn't be able to fill the bean hopper there. We'll keep it where it is now, near the edge of the countertop. If I need that space, I could move it underneath the cabinet when I'm not filling the bean hopper, but like I said, it's heavy. You could scoot it, but do you want to?This is my first espresso maker, so I honestly didn't know what I was doing. The Quick Start Guide is slick and would probably work pretty well for someone who has used espresso makers before. However, I was glad to see that De'Longhi has a YouTube channel. It has plenty of good videos on it. Just search ""De'Longhi La Specialista"" (plus any additional search terms like ""latte"" or ""cleaning."") Look for the videos put out by ""De'Longhi How-To."" So far, I've found these videos to be helpful:-Setting up La Specialista for the first time-Making espresso for the first time-Making a Caffe Latte-Regular cleaning procedures of La SpecialistaI really wish the item had come with a full instruction manual. I like to have actual paper to flip through when I'm figuring out a new machine! I found the full instruction manual on De'Longhi's website. It was about 20 pages long, so I printed it out. Between that and the YouTube videos, I was in good shape.When I was setting up the machine, there was a red, bean-shaped, blinking light. I looked it up and realized I hadn't positioned the hopper correctly. The instruction manual helped me there. To properly position the hopper, place it in the machine (you'll be able to feel what position works), and twist to the left until it clicks. The lock icon on the hopper will line up with the arrow below. I wasn't twisting hard enough at first. (See photo for proper positioning.)Take the time to follow the instructions in the set-up video to prime your machine. Then take the time to follow the instructions in the espresso video to get your bean dosage and grind size correct. This all takes a while, but it's worth it! You'll probably end up wasting some grounds when you're getting the bean dosage correct. I saved mine in a plastic container to use in our regular drip coffeemaker later. By the way, to get enough grounds, I had to turn the dial for bean dosage further to the right than I expected; it's on the third mark.The cleaning video helped me. I hadn't realized the single and double filters (the ones that go inside the portafilter) each have a little part inside in the bottom that can be removed. If you look, you can see a little tab on the rubber gasket portion of the filter. Mine were placed in there so tightly, I had to use needle-nosed pliers to get that part off! It's supposed to be removed for cleaning. (See photo.) I hope that as I use it more, the part will loosen up a bit, but for now, I'm keeping pliers in the drawer below the machine.I LOVE the Smart Tamping lever! It's so easy to properly tamp down the grinds down! (See photo.)The accessories for this machine are generally heavy, which I love. The portafilter is heavy. The milk frothing jug is heavy. Even the water container feels like nice, thick plastic. The bean hopper feels lightweight, but it has a nice, metal lid.Clean-up will take some time, but there's no getting around that. It's really not too bad, and if you're making multiple drinks, you don't have to clean everything in between. (For instance, you can wait to clean the drip tray and milk steaming/frothing nozzle until you're done making drinks for your appreciative family and friends.)I made three tasty lattes, including one with almond milk, and my family members are already fans. I feel confident that, using this machine, I can make drinks rivaling the $5 ones I buy at Starbucks. I'm even going to try to learn to do some latte art, because why not?All in all, are there cheaper espresso makers out there? Absolutely. Many people, understandably, don't want to pay this much for a machine that makes coffee drinks. Having experienced the quality of this machine, I'm confident I'll enjoy the beverage-creation process more than I would with a more lightweight, budget-friendly machine. If you're getting an espresso maker because you want to save money instead of buying coffee shop drinks, you'll have to make a whole lot of drinks to break even on this machine! If you're getting an espresso maker because you enjoy the process of making your own drinks at home, and you put a high monetary value on quality and the pleasure of using well-made tools, this may be just the right choice for you.",16 people found this helpful,No

What is easy about this machine is that there is no mess or muss w the grinds spilling out, or wondering if i'm tamping with the adequate pressure or if i'm tamping at an angle, etc... since most of those variables are accounted for and taken out of the picture with the automated grind/tamp system in this machine. I think this machine allows aspiring amateurs like myself to get a better espresso with control over a few variables such as general heat, broad grind size, and water amount, without having to be an expert at grind preparation and tamping, controlling pressure directly or having an exact PID temperature controller. Altho this machine has a secondary milk heating system, it is not a true dual boiler, since you can't froth and pull a shot at the same time. But the delay is a bit shorter between shot and milk heat up with this machine. The plus with the ease of using this machine is that even my espresso-machine-phobic husband was willing to move the portafilter from the grind area to the group head and press the ""ok"" button to get a shot.The pics show me using the single shot (they provide the non-pressurized only) basket, and dark roasted (big box store) Guatemalan Arabica beans on the ""2"" fine grind level w a dosage dialed to the line in the tamped filter, and a 2 ""bar"" out of 3 heat setting.  I tried to use the instruction manual's suggested 1 bar heat setting and a ""5"" grind coarseness for dark roast coffees originally, but this gave me a weak and runny espresso.Although not shown, i also used a timer scale for a few pulls, just to check out what I was getting out. What I'm finding is that, at least with the beans I'm currently using, I can fit about 13g of coffee in the basket, and i'm getting about 35 g espresso out in a fast 12 seconds, w the pressure guage going to about the 11 o'clock region at the height. I tried to slow this down by using more coffee and a finer grind, but that did not work as well (basket got stuck, espresso did not taste as good)....so, i'm kinda wondering if i'm doing something wrong, but, ""2"" grind level as is, and 12 seconds tastes pretty good. i'll mess around with this more when i get to a different bean. I recently had also read about ""turbo"" shots that provide better extraction at relatively coarser grinds and faster speeds - such as my 12 sec, at a 1:2 or 1:3 grinds to espresso ratio being ideal for extraction, but that's a whole other controversy apparently. All I can say is that my espresso through this machine at the settings noted is flavorful, not bitter, bright tasting and yummy in general.I am having a big learning curve with the 3 hole milk frother wand tho, and it's been kinda challenging in comparison to the 1 hole wand i'm used to. Still, I made a decent looking froth at least for the pics shown.Overall, I'm liking this machine because I have some control of my espresso results, but my  non-caring-about-making-espresso-just-wanna-drink-it-now-can-u-just-make-it-for-me husband can pretty much make one too.  The resulting espresso is really tasty, and ultimately, that's what an espresso machine is for, i figure.",10 people found this helpful,No

It just upped the class of the whole room. My poor fridge has already developed an inferiority complex, and let's not even talk about my cheap drip coffeemaker!The machine was packaged really well in the large box. I was glad two of us were there to pull the lighter-weight box out of the heavyweight box, because it fit so snugly. I was also glad two of us were there to pull the styrofoam-encased machine out, and I was glad one of us (not me) was strong enough to feel confident taking it out and placing it on the countertop. This thing is quite heavy, because it's made out of lots of metal components that, from what I can tell, are high quality.While the espresso maker would fit underneath my cabinets, I wouldn't be able to fill the bean hopper there. We'll keep it where it is now, near the edge of the countertop. If I need that space, I could move it underneath the cabinet when I'm not filling the bean hopper, but like I said, it's heavy. You could scoot it, but do you want to?This is my first espresso maker, so I honestly didn't know what I was doing. The Quick Start Guide is slick and would probably work pretty well for someone who has used espresso makers before. However, I was glad to see that De'Longhi has a YouTube channel. It has plenty of good videos on it. Just search ""De'Longhi La Specialista"" (plus any additional search terms like ""latte"" or ""cleaning."") Look for the videos put out by ""De'Longhi How-To."" So far, I've found these videos to be helpful:-Setting up La Specialista for the first time-Making espresso for the first time-Making a Caffe Latte-Regular cleaning procedures of La SpecialistaI really wish the item had come with a full instruction manual. I like to have actual paper to flip through when I'm figuring out a new machine! I found the full instruction manual on De'Longhi's website. It was about 20 pages long, so I printed it out. Between that and the YouTube videos, I was in good shape.When I was setting up the machine, there was a red, bean-shaped, blinking light. I looked it up and realized I hadn't positioned the hopper correctly. The instruction manual helped me there. To properly position the hopper, place it in the machine (you'll be able to feel what position works), and twist to the left until it clicks. The lock icon on the hopper will line up with the arrow below. I wasn't twisting hard enough at first. (See photo for proper positioning.)Take the time to follow the instructions in the set-up video to prime your machine. Then take the time to follow the instructions in the espresso video to get your bean dosage and grind size correct. This all takes a while, but it's worth it! You'll probably end up wasting some grounds when you're getting the bean dosage correct. I saved mine in a plastic container to use in our regular drip coffeemaker later. By the way, to get enough grounds, I had to turn the dial for bean dosage further to the right than I expected; it's on the third mark.The cleaning video helped me. I hadn't realized the single and double filters (the ones that go inside the portafilter) each have a little part inside in the bottom that can be removed. If you look, you can see a little tab on the rubber gasket portion of the filter. Mine were placed in there so tightly, I had to use needle-nosed pliers to get that part off! It's supposed to be removed for cleaning. (See photo.) I hope that as I use it more, the part will loosen up a bit, but for now, I'm keeping pliers in the drawer below the machine.I LOVE the Smart Tamping lever! It's so easy to properly tamp down the grinds down! (See photo.)The accessories for this machine are generally heavy, which I love. The portafilter is heavy. The milk frothing jug is heavy. Even the water container feels like nice, thick plastic. The bean hopper feels lightweight, but it has a nice, metal lid.Clean-up will take some time, but there's no getting around that. It's really not too bad, and if you're making multiple drinks, you don't have to clean everything in between. (For instance, you can wait to clean the drip tray and milk steaming/frothing nozzle until you're done making drinks for your appreciative family and friends.)I made three tasty lattes, including one with almond milk, and my family members are already fans. I feel confident that, using this machine, I can make drinks rivaling the $5 ones I buy at Starbucks. I'm even going to try to learn to do some latte art, because why not?All in all, are there cheaper espresso makers out there? Absolutely. Many people, understandably, don't want to pay this much for a machine that makes coffee drinks. Having experienced the quality of this machine, I'm confident I'll enjoy the beverage-creation process more than I would with a more lightweight, budget-friendly machine. If you're getting an espresso maker because you want to save money instead of buying coffee shop drinks, you'll have to make a whole lot of drinks to break even on this machine! If you're getting an espresso maker because you enjoy the process of making your own drinks at home, and you put a high monetary value on quality and the pleasure of using well-made tools, this may be just the right choice for you.",16 people found this helpful,No

We have found it with this De’Longhi.  I have a Nespresso Innissa for quick espressos and a Barista-style espresso machine I got on Amazon, but the De’Longhi sails far above either of those machines.  And so it should at this price point, but I do believe this machine would be hard to beat in the sub-$1000 category of home espresso machines.  A fantastic feature that really makes a difference is the built-in tamper.  Tamping usually makes a mess on the counter but this machine with the pull of handle on the side does it before you remove the portafilter.  I got lucky to set the grind right the second time so that the coffee, once tamped, was right at the level line indicated to get a great brew.  I set my grind to #4 for my coffee beans and that seemed to work well also.  Another excellent feature of the De’Longhi is the pull down tray to place your cup(s) on.  Keeping your cup close to the drip also aids in getting the best crema on your espresso.  I ran a cup through both of my espresso machines using the same beans and you could really taste the difference the De’Longhi made.  The coffee (same coffee) actually tasted better!  I think it goes to show the technology in these higher-end machines and the superior extraction process.  I know this isn’t a cheap decision but if you are going up to that sub-$1000 price range, I don’t think you can beat this machine.  I will also add that it is just gorgeous looking in terms of design and really impresses on the kitchen countertop!",8 people found this helpful,No

My husband loves espresso, but orders from a local restaurant when he's in the mood and he is no barista.I'm a tea drinker, so yeah, what do I know. For the review I can tell you this, husband and visitor loved the results from the first shot. The beans ground in moments (just the right amount, automatically), the tamper is built in and tamps just right, the coffee brewed beautifully, and had the nice crema that apparently espresso drinkers appreciate for a silky touch.So I can't talk to the taste, but I can say that this is a well built machine and heavy, although there is some plastic involved. Still, it's a high quality appliance. The controls are self-explanatory (although reading the manual would be helpful for the uninitiated).This appliance will be much appreciated in our New England home by the visitors who are accustomed to a daily jolt or two of Cafe Cubano. We're ready.UPDATE Aug 13 2022: And on this day the grinder died. An hour spent cleaning the hopper and grinder parts and no luck. Downgraded to three stars and those remain because it really does make great coffee I'm told, and it still brews.But turns out it's a complicated process even for some people who know how to use an espresso maker, impossible for those who haven't without the instructions and no one bothers with instructions, they just barrel ahead.Be prepared to be the sole barista when guests arrive.FURTHER UPDATE: We sent it to an authorized repair company and they fixed it. From now on if someone wants an espresso they can wait until we prepare it for them.Still three stars.

I have machines and accessories for just about every way of preparing coffee, to include 3 espresso machines, and a stove top (Mokka).  For the past few years we have been using a Phillips Saeco machine.  It is very easy, and also very good, but it does consistently pour a little water into the cup before it dispenses coffee... so it is good, but less than ideal.Some years ago I read on Coffee Geek that your grinder can make as much of a difference as your machine/ method of preparation.  I went through half a dozen grinders before I found one which lasted for more than a month or two past warranty (and there were several expensive grinders from well known companies).  The machine which lasted, the one we still use 6 or 7 years later, is a De'Longhi.  I also have a toaster oven from De'Longhi in my garage.  We used it for over 20 years, replacing it only this year with an air fryer, but held onto the De'Longhi in case that gives out.  All that said, I know that De'Longhi makes solid equipment which performs well and is reliable.  In fact, I sent my son a De'Longhi espresso machine when he graduated from college and then got stranded in California, by the shut downs.  Sensibly the next machine I would look at would be a De'Longhi.This machine does take more effort than the one we had been using, but it is an all in one machine.  It has a conical burr grinder which dispenses into the portafilter.  There is also a built in tamper.  The portafilter is then moved to where the water is expressed.  You can adjust the coarseness/ fineness of the grind and the amount of coffee ground/ dispensed as well as the amount of water and temperature.  A chart is provided with suggestions based on the roast.  There are also options with respect to how much froth is produced.This machine provides a lot more control than the Saeco and the amount of water, speed, heat are determined based on grind and dose settings.  The end result was espresso which was much better than I have been able to make with the other machines I have had.While the machine is not automatic, everything you need is provided, with recommendations for getting the best from each type of roast, but you can choose the grind and amount based on personal preferences, and store some of those choices with the ""my"" button.",5 people found this helpful,No

It’s all stainless steel and is ready for decades of use because the stainless will look good for the life of the espresso machine without rusting away like other materials would have. And with all the other pieces and parts fitting perfectly well and made to last just like the stainless it can and will be passed on hopefully to another espresso lover just like myself. The instructions were informative and easy to read and understand and the pictures helped me immediately with setup and use. It grinds the beans to exacting specifications for this machines use. It does the tampering to required pressure as well with just a push of a button. I’m getting better and faster everyday in its use and with it doing most of the work for me with probably one hundred percent more accuracy than me. Each and every espresso I let it make for us is the perfect cup every time, all the time. It does get noticed immediately sitting on our counter the moment eyes set on it as it’s brilliant brightness and ultimate quality stands out against every other appliance we have. Definitely starts many a conversations. I’m fully satisfied with the quality of and the functionality it provides us daily. Update (24 December 2021) added a picture of the pressure dial getting into the optimal zone. Once dialed in we were rewarded with a great tasting five star experience!! Update (17 February 2022) We definitely are still enjoying the espresso machine and it’s ease of use but when it needs to be descaled everything comes to a screeching halt for 45 minutes. I turned it on this morning to prepare it for our drinks and we are just sitting around now waiting for it to descale. Maybe a switch so it’s not always need descaling at the critical time we need it the most. But still 5 stars. Five Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!! Update (March 7 2022) I stand corrected, as long as the knob is in any other position other than the descaling mode when the light comes on it will still continue to make espressos until AFTER the morning rush and can be descaled at our leisure later that day or night. We are still happy with the daily operation of the machine!!  Still 5 Stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!",5 people found this helpful,No

After using it 2 or 3 times a day for the past two weeks, I can say without any exaggeration that it looks and performs exactly like a professional espresso machine and has everything you need to make espresso drinks that taste *exactly* as good as the best coffee houses. Although I could write a full report detailing why I believe it is an outstanding machine, I'll limit this to a just-the-facts paragraph. First off, it is fast, and you can have a double-espresso latte made within 5 minutes of turning it on. It is also the cleanest real espresso machine that I've ever used; the grinder doesn't leave coffee grounds anywhere and any small amounts of powder from the tamper collect straight down into the drip tray. The tamper is connected to the tamping lever with a spring which ensures that you don't over- or under-tamp the basket. The brewing has a perfect amount of automation, by which I mean that you still have a good control of the coarseness of the grind and the brewing temperature. One thing that really stands out to me is that it has a gauge that gives you feedback on the brewing pressure which gives you direct feedback to use for adjusting the grind coarseness for the specific beans that you're using. Selecting between a single or double shot is as easy as pressing a button and switching between espresso, Americano, or single serving of regular coffee in just a turn of a knob. For the Americano, it even automatically adds the right amount of hot water. The steam wand is really impressive because the control knob activates a pump that pulses water into the steam chamber which eliminates having to drain the wand of condensate and also ensures that there is the right amount of steam pressure. I could easily go on about this machine but suffice it to say that it really is that impressive! Highly recommend!",4 people found this helpful,No

For the longest time I still couldn’t justify spending this much on a coffee machine, however I’m here to say that the D’longhi Specialista is worth every penny plus some. Aesthetically, this machine looks excellent on your countertops. Performance wise, this expresso machine is impressive and makes some of the best coffee you will ever have. The grinder on the top is great so that I don’t have to use my extra coffee grinder and the coffee is always super fresh. It portions out the exact amount needed for a cup of expresso based on your selection. It is a bit tricky to get the hang of initially, but the instructions are clear (plus their are videos online) and once you get the hang of it, it’s not complicated at all. It’s just going from a Keuirg to a fancy machine like this takes a bit of practice. I can make a double shot of expresso and foam/ steam my milk and no longer need to make a coffee run to get the coffee I desire. You can even pick the temperature that you want which is nice. Machine is tall, so if you have an older 1950’s home with shorter cabinets you will need to measure to be sure it fits under cabinet. We are not done renovating yet so cabinets are still short and I have to remove grinder accessory to push it so it sits flush under cabinet.Overall, I would highly recommend this. It is an expresso machine that you will get your money’s worth out of and the quality is top notch.",3 people found this helpful,No

But some in my household are absolute coffee fanatics. My wife and my daughter have the knowledge and are the real critics. One daughter works as a barista in a private high end coffee shop and is used to expensive equipment. That said...We all think this is a great machine.Everything about it feels and looks like quality, it is well designed, and it works well.Unboxing and setting it up was fairly simple.  As is typical (I guess) it took a few days of tweaking to fine tune it to our coffee preferences, but even the trial and error ""fails"" were drinkable.A big plus is the tamping. It is manually done... sort of. Well, it's foolproof. Hand tamping can be a learned skill (that I never quite mastered), but this doesn't require that. There is a lever on the side of the machine (like a slot machine) which is mechanically set to tamp to the right density. Works great, even when I do it!The milk frother is the real deal (though I'm not the big user), and works well. We (they) can make just about any coffee drink known to man now.There are also auto settings for americanos and regular coffees, but we really stick to the double espresso setting.Love it!

In those years I have repeatedly tried to get good at making espresso (my partner is the espresso maker in our house).  Every time, I give up.Part of that is because it feels too easy to make a mistake and part of that is because its a huge mess. Particularly getting the grounds from the grinder, and then temping them down. I know that probably sounds finicky and whiny to folks who really love their espresso but I hate it and it led to our counters never feeling clean.The fact that grinding and tamping is in the machine is infinitely better. It keeps our counters cleaner but it also means that when we get new beans, my partner can do all the fiddling to get the exact right grind and dose and then we just leave it that way for me to make my own drinks. Despite using this machine for over a month, I still don't know the principles behind getting the perfect pull, and I am totally okay with that. I am making more espresso drinks now than I ever did with the Gaggia. I don't know if purists find that annoying, but the added features make it a lot more user friendly. I am even pretty confident if my mom came to visit, I could show her how to do it once and then she could just make her own drinks.SIZEBecause the photo I took has the Gaggia in front of the De'Longhi it makes the Gaggia look a bit bigger than it actually is. It is definitely narrower, but a tiny bit taller. It used to live under our cabinet and had a fairly small footprint on the counter. The De'Longhi is more substantial and can't fit under the counter. If you took off the lid to the bean hopper, you could totally put it under the counter but that would leave the beans unprotected from the air and they would go stale. If your cabinets are a bit taller you might be okay but I think they are generally hung at a standard height. Because of that, we have it half under the cabinet with the hopper sticking out. There's only one real place in our kitchen that it fits that way, which is right next to the sink. While I think I'd prefer to have it on the left side of the sink which is impossible to do, this is okay - not ideal but okay.OVERALLIn the end, this is a nice compromise for my partner and I. He's super into making espresso and getting things as perfect as possible. I'm not interested in that at all, I just want good coffee. This is an excellent way for both of us to have what we want without me having to bug him for every drink. I also use the hot water function for tea every morning which means I can put my kettle in the cabinet. There is a way to change how much water comes out with the hot water function I believe but I haven't fiddled with it yet.",2 people found this helpful,No

Having said that, this machine is beautiful and looks very expensive (which, it is).  It does not have too many parts to keep track of so that's good, but it does have more bits then I'm used to having to maintain, so it is a bit of an adjustment for me.  Putting it together out of the box wasn't that bad.This draws a LOT of power.  I don't know too much about these things but I know it blew a breaker right away.  I had to move appliances around in my kitchen for sure.I watched the videos on You Tube on how to work this machine and was enjoying several lattes right right away (I wanted to practice).

I've followed the instructions on how to correct this but nothing I do seems to change the look of the espresso coming out of the machine.  I guess it's no big deal because whatever this is making is delicious and a billion times better then the coffee I was making before, and I'll watch more videos and try and figure it out.I don't love:You can't froth milk and make espresso at the same time.  I guess that makes sense but I wish you could.There is no clearance for a decent sized mug.  I know us Americans make giant coffees, but hey, this is being sold to Americans so please make it a little but taller.  You can't remove the grill to give more clearance and make the machine work.There isn't much clearance for the frothing wand and it doesn't really move that much.  I don't feel like I can froth that much milk at a time.So basically, my main complaints right now are that I want to make giant beverages and this machine forces me to have portion/quantity control, which all is a #firstworldproblem!",6 people found this helpful,No

It had a bit of a learning curve, though. So first… The unpacking itself was impressive. The packaging was done so well I barely could get the tightly packed machine out of the attractive and well-designed box.  The machine and its parts were packed within some seriously dense foam and the smaller parts were packed within a much smaller well-designed box within the main box.  The machine and parts were wrapped in a plastic wrap that ensured that even a small blemish could not occur during packaging or shipping.  The box contained all the parts necessary to make all types of one- and two-shot drinks: 2 espresso filters to make a single or a double espresso, descaling tablets, a stainless-steel milk pitcher, and a cleaning brush, and single-use descaling solution.My friend and I removed the parts from the box and we began the very small amount of assembly and setting the unit up on my countertop.  I decided to fill the bean hopper before I installed it onto the top of the machine.  I lay out a cloth and filled the hopper and once I started to move the hopper to the top of the machine, beans fell out of the bottom of the hopper onto the countertop.  Yes, the bean hopper has an open bottom.  That made us realize that you cannot remove the bean hopper while there are beans in it and it is installed on the top of the machine because they will spill out over the top of the machine and onto your counter and floor.  The bean hopper must be visibly empty to remove it from the top of the machine or you must vacuum the beans out of the hopper before removal from the machine or later vacuum the beans off the counters and floor.After that fiasco, I decided I might want to refer to the Quick Start Guide for the remaining setup items.  If in doubt, read the manual/quick start guide. The Quick Start Guide is helpful but in no way takes the place of the full manual.  My initial test results were poor.  But, after reading the full manual and still getting less than optimal results in grinding and brewing, I decided that the full manual does not take the place of the many YouTube videos available to help with settings and operation of the machine.  After reviewing several YouTube videos, I got to action, made some adjustments, and had much better results.I really like the integrated grinder with Sensor Grinding Technology which provides consistent grinding and the Smart Tamping Station perfect pressure tamper.  It took some looking at YouTube videos for me to understand the grinding operation and how to adjust the grind to get the optimal grind for crema but once I tinkered with it and did several test grinds and test shots of espresso, I better understood the adjustment needed to get the optimal shot and crema with the coffee beans I was using.  I believe it will be easy to adjust the grind to suit any other coffee bean I might choose in the future should I decide to change the brand and type of bean.  Understanding and using the tamping mechanism was a breeze.My favorite part of the machine is the Immediate Start function.  Yes, you can power the machine on and start grinding immediately.  While you are grinding, the machine is readying itself for the brewing, preparing hot water for Americano and/or milk frothing.  It uses two independent heating systems so there is no waiting time between the espresso and the milk preparation.  The Advanced Latte System is super easy to use and I was able to make the perfect foam the very first time I tried.  There are two options for milk – foam and flat.  The only downside is I wish the stainless-steel milk frothing pitcher were larger.  It only holds enough for a small latte.  I will definitely be purchasing a larger pitcher.The overflow tray offers a warning by use of a piece of floating plastic that sticks up through the tray as the tray fills.  By the time this happens, the tray is difficult to remove and balance to get it to the sink to empty.  Since it is easy to remove and check for fullness, I would suggest you remove it and rinse it before it gets to this level.  Some of the buttons function to give water for rinsing and steam for other parts of the machine for cleaning.Overall, the great design of this espresso maker makes this piece of equipment fancy up my countertop.  It’s just a gorgeous amalgam of stainless steel that looks luxurious and professional at the same time.I do think some things could be better.  For one, the milk steamer pitcher is small – very small – only 12 oz.  That may sound big enough but it only holds enough milk and foam for a half-full mug of latte.  But that is an easy to resolve issue by purchasing a larger pitcher.  The bean hopper should have some type of mechanism that would allow it to be removed without losing all of the beans.  I would think some type of an operable lever that could close off the hopper might be a plus.  I also think the height of the bean hopper can be a problem with top cabinets that are not abnormally high.  Mine are about 17-1/2”, pretty close to new Cabinet standards, and the hopper lid does not fit on the hopper and fit under my cabinet.  It’s just a little too tall. I am using a small piece of plastic to cover the hopper when it is under the cabinet.  This could be a major problem for some because many cabinets are much lower than mine.  Also, the low upper cabinet might get in the way of operating the tamper lever.  In addition, the drip tray could use an early warning system instead of a “too late” system to notify the user that it is full.  And, lastly even though the water fill chamber holds quite a bit of water and the machine seems efficient in its use of the water, I would appreciate it if the water fill chamber was on the side for easier filling and access.Since my machine has only been in use a couple of days, I have not yet descaled.  I’m certain I will provide lots of use and therefore opportunity to see if it continues to function well.  If not, the machine has a one-year parts and labor warranty. I will amend this review if I find any major flaws or if this espresso maker does not hold up as I think it will.

A few years ago, I started working from home, and I got in the habit of going to Starbucks every morning to have a few minutes of human interaction before returning to my home office. By early August, I realized I had spent over $900 year to date on coffee, decided it needed to stop, and picked up a Keurig. It saved me a ton of money, but it wasn't nearly as good as espresso drinks. Enter the DeLonghi!Size/Space: First thing's first - before you jump in and order one yourself, figure out if you have anywhere you can put it! The unit itself is about 16"" wide, 16"" deep (with power cord), and 17-1/2"" high. The height is a big one, because the standard clearance from kitchen countertops to cupboards is 18"" - however, if the kitchen has been remodeled, the counter tops may have been upgraded to a thicker surface than older materials - I found my cupboards were only 17-1/4 to 17-1/2"" above the countertops, and it wasn't possible to slide this under the cupboards, so I had to find a new home. Now, even if you DID put it under the cupboards, you may find that you don't have sufficient access to remove the water reservoir on the back or access the bean hopper on top without pulling the unit out, which can be a little bit challenging in its own right. Height issues aside, you should be aware of the width - it's about 16"" wide total, but you can't sandwich this right up against a wall - you need clearance on BOTH. I'd say you need about 3-4"" minimum on either side to operate the tamper (left) and the knob for the steam wand (right). Minimum, I'd say you need 20"" of space, or it needs to be next to items on the counter that are shorter than the knobs (I have mine on one edge of the counter, and a knife block next to the machine that is short enough to easily operate the knob and steam wand)Setup: Initially, it can be a little challenging to figure out how to use it, but after doing it once, it's easy. Fill the Reservoir in back (filtered water recommended), Fill the bean hopper with your preferred espresso beans and turn the base of the hopper to the preferred grind setting (1-8, the guide that came with the machine suggested about a 4 for a medium roast which was a very good starting point). Turn the unit on with the Portafilter detached. The Portafilter has interchangeable single shot or double shot baskets - putting the basket in the first time is a little difficult because the springs are new, give it a good press/smack with your palm. Now, *IF* you're making a double shot, choose the ""x2"" button on the face of the machine first. Choose your extraction temperature on the face - it's indicated with 3 horizontal bars, and pressing the button cycles between 1, 2 and 3 bars - DeLonghi recommends 2 bars for Medium Roast beans. Finally, you'll have to adjust the ""dose"" (amount of ground beans) with a dial. You may need to waste some grind/beans the first time to get it right - start low and adjust the dose until, when tamped, the grind is even with the stamped ring inside the portafilter basket (adjusted for both single and double shot baskets)Daily use: Once you get that set up above dialed in, it's pretty easy - turn the machine on, insert the Portafilter - the machine will automatically grind the beans into the filter. Once the grind is finished, the machine will flash the tamping indicator to let you know to pull the arm to tamp the grind - just pull the arm to the indicated full pull line, and you're set. Remove the portafilter and insert it into the brew head, set your cup/mug under it, and press the ""Ok"" button (could have been called start). You'll have espresso within about 60 seconds of turning the machine on. I had a perfect shot the very first time I used the machine, and I was shocked. I worked at a Starbucks 25 years ago, and I vividly remember needing to adjust my tamping pressure a few times nearly every time I started a shift until I had it right. Now that I've been using this about 2 weeks, I continue to adjust a little, but I haven't yet had anything that resembled a *bad* shot - just ranging from good to perfect.Steaming: This is one area where I'm not thrilled with the machine. The dial on the right hand side of the machine has two settings - on or off. You turn the dial all the way until it clicks to start the steam, and then you click it off to stop, and starting the steam isn't instant - it builds pressure before releasing it. I would have preferred the knob work as an adjustable valve to control the flow. The other thing I don't love about the wand is that it is TOO vertical. 17.5° from vertical is as far as you can move it, so it's not as easy as I'd like to get a good vortex in the pitcher to incorporate the foam. I was able to adjust to this after a couple days, so if you get your technique down, it works fine. I think a small change to the wand would make this much nicer though.Side note: get yourself a clip-on dial thermometer for your pitcher for steaming milk. Using a thermometer will keep you from scorching your milk. They can be found, with clip, for as little as $9 - but it may be worth spending a few dollars more. This is a detail that I think DeLonghi is missing - it would be great if they included a clip with thermometer properly sized/fit for the included pitcher - the thermometer I bought is a bit long for my liking.Cleaning: This is perhaps the area that can be burdensome - I'm pretty much the only one drinking espresso in the house (unless my mother-in-law is visiting), so it can be a little time consuming to clean the Portafilter, Pitcher, and Steam Wand every morning after making myself a latté - but all told, the process takes 5 minutes - less time than stopping in a coffee shop, and much less once you factor in time getting there and back.Final Verdict: While the size of this machine caused some early consternation, once I found a home for it, I quickly grew to enjoy it. Early on, I doubted that I'd use it daily, but there's only been one day since setting it up that I didn't use it - and that was only because I woke up to a colossal work disaster that left no time for even the smallest of luxuries. The quality of the espresso has far exceeded my expectations! As for time and convenience, a few years ago I dated someone with a Nespresso machine - and I don't think there's a whole lot of time savings in using the Nespresso versus using this to make proper espresso - using the Nespresso pods probably saves 1-2 minutes, and most of that is really in clean-up.",One person found this helpful,No

Seriously perfect. Like, I almost cry with the first sip every. single. time. I also love the bean hopper and how easy the tamping process is with this. There are many challenges, however, with the rest of the machine. The first being that it draws so much amperage, that it flips the circuit almost every time I use it. We live in a new custom home with a brand new electric system. From the street, to the box, to the wiring. I’ve never had a breaker trip. Even when using multiple large appliances at the same time. It’s a pain. Next disappointment is the steam/wand. It’s really lame. It doesn’t build much steam power and it “pulses” the steam. It takes forever to froth milk. The wand doesn’t have a big enough range of motion to hold a bigger size pitcher comfortably. I ended up purchasing a countertop milk frother that is <<chef’s kiss!>> But again, how stupid that I need an additional step. The last thing is the interface. It’s totally and needlessly complicated. Please just give me 2 shots of espresso, an option for hot water after my shots are pulled and froth the milk quickly and creamy. I don’t want 5 additional and irrelevant buttons and lights to blink at me every morning, pre-coffee. Overall, I think this machine is trying to do too much so it fails to do the 1 thing perfectly.

   This De'Longhi La Specialista Prestigio Espresso Machine is well made and a bit heavy because it is solid. The assembly is very minimal. There are two manuals and both must be referred to because the more colorful one doesn't have all the parts identified. Some of the better features include the filter holder assembly which has a long handle on it and locks into place and automatically initiates the grinding of the beans in the hopper. The big advantage is that when it locks into place, there is no place for ground coffee to fall out and make a mess. Also, the tamper is built in and the coffee is precisely tamped and since the tamping takes place with no place for the coffee to fall out, again there is no coffee ground mess. One can make either coffee or espresso with this machine.  In my pictures you can see one cup with coffee and the other with espresso.  The grind of the beans can be adjusted allowing for different strength and smoothness. The frothier can be set to specific settings so the cup does not have to be moved around to get the desired results. The espresso maker can be set to self clean with steaming hot water. Excess water runs down into the tray and a red plastic pieces floats up through the grill to show you when it is time to empty the water out of the tray. This machine gives professional results without having to have professional technique. This is the most user friendly espresso machine I have ever operated.",One person found this helpful,No

Parts of the machine are literally flimsy plastic. If you can see this from the outside, I can only imagine how much plastic is on the inside of this machine. The tamper is PLASTIC, the lid on the grinder is PLASTIC and the outside of the machine dents easily and is just plain CHEAP. It’s all a facade! After spending $800 on a machine you would think they can spring for materials that are more than aluminum and plastic!After 2 months of daily use (maybe 3 or 4 shots a day) it started leaking from the spout that goes into the drip tray. I would wake up to a puddle of water every morning. In addition... The water doesn’t get hot enough, the grinder is no where near the quality that it needs to be to make the kind of espresso that you think you are paying for. Bottom line is there is always something wrong with this machine and no one could ever figure out what it is with those cryptic symbols they have popping up!

After many years of faithful service, my replacement Gaggia gave up, so I was looking for an espresso machine that could provide ample pressure (and a grinder). Upon unboxing, I was impressed by the solid build quality and overall looks of the La Specialista; is it gorgeous on the countertop and has a bit of a 1950s vibe to it.Pros: Two independent heating systems (one for milk, one for coffee).  You can tamp directly in the filter holder.  The advanced latte system lets you choose between flat (hot milk only) or foam. It has three presets for espresso, Americano, and coffee.Be sure to read the instruction manual before attempting setup. It's worth watching all the DeLonghi how-to videos on YouTube first before setting up for the first time (especially about using the built-in grinder as this is my first machine that has one, and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve).  And you may want to experiment with the coffee bean grinder (any whole coffee beans will work; it doesn't have to be ""espresso"" blend!) to find the grind that's best for you.This is like upgrading to a Ferrari; absolute beauty! I loved the quick startup (my previous Gaggia took about 10 minutes to prime) and the quality of the crema / coffee (if you are a fan of flavored drinks, you can also make your own mochas or add flavored syrups; I loved the fact that this makes fantastic flat whites). Absolutely gorgeous foam, too.Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the La Specialista and look forward to many years of excellent lattes and cappuccinos!",2 people found this helpful,No

I have a Nespresso Innissa for quick espressos and a Barista-style espresso machine I got on Amazon, but the De’Longhi sails far above either of those machines.  And so it should at this price point, but I do believe this machine would be hard to beat in the sub-$1000 category of home espresso machines.  A fantastic feature that really makes a difference is the built-in tamper.  Tamping usually makes a mess on the counter but this machine with the pull of handle on the side does it before you remove the portafilter.  I got lucky to set the grind right the second time so that the coffee, once tamped, was right at the level line indicated to get a great brew.  I set my grind to #4 for my coffee beans and that seemed to work well also.  Another excellent feature of the De’Longhi is the pull down tray to place your cup(s) on.  Keeping your cup close to the drip also aids in getting the best crema on your espresso.  I ran a cup through both of my espresso machines using the same beans and you could really taste the difference the De’Longhi made.  The coffee (same coffee) actually tasted better!  I think it goes to show the technology in these higher-end machines and the superior extraction process.  I know this isn’t a cheap decision but if you are going up to that sub-$1000 price range, I don’t think you can beat this machine.

I have machines and accessories for just about every way of preparing coffee, to include 3 espresso machines, and a stove top (Mokka).  For the past few years we have been using a Phillips Saeco machine.  It is very easy, and also very good, but it does consistently pour a little water into the cup before it dispenses coffee... so it is good, but less than ideal.Some years ago I read on Coffee Geek that your grinder can make as much of a difference as your machine/ method of preparation.  I went through half a dozen grinders before I found one which lasted for more than a month or two past warranty (and there were several expensive grinders from well known companies).  The machine which lasted, the one we still use 6 or 7 years later, is a De'Longhi.  I also have a toaster oven from De'Longhi in my garage.  We used it for over 20 years, replacing it only this year with an air fryer, but held onto the De'Longhi in case that gives out.  All that said, I know that De'Longhi makes solid equipment which performs well and is reliable.  In fact, I sent my son a De'Longhi espresso machine when he graduated from college and then got stranded in California, by the shut downs.  Sensibly the next machine I would look at would be a De'Longhi.This machine does take more effort than the one we had been using, but it is an all in one machine.  It has a conical burr grinder which dispenses into the portafilter.  There is also a built in tamper.  The portafilter is then moved to where the water is expressed.  You can adjust the coarseness/ fineness of the grind and the amount of coffee ground/ dispensed as well as the amount of water and temperature.  A chart is provided with suggestions based on the roast.  There are also options with respect to how much froth is produced.This machine provides a lot more control than the Saeco and the amount of water, speed, heat are determined based on grind and dose settings.  The end result was espresso which was much better than I have been able to make with the other machines I have had.While the machine is not automatic, everything you need is provided, with recommendations for getting the best from each type of roast, but you can choose the grind and amount based on personal preferences, and store some of those choices with the ""my"" button.",5 people found this helpful,No

Update (March 7 2022) I stand corrected, as long as the knob is in any other position other than the descaling mode when the light comes on it will still continue to make espressos until AFTER the morning rush and can be descaled at our leisure later that day or night. We are still happy with the daily operation of the machine!!  Still 5 Stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!",5 people found this helpful,No

After using it 2 or 3 times a day for the past two weeks, I can say without any exaggeration that it looks and performs exactly like a professional espresso machine and has everything you need to make espresso drinks that taste *exactly* as good as the best coffee houses. Although I could write a full report detailing why I believe it is an outstanding machine, I'll limit this to a just-the-facts paragraph. First off, it is fast, and you can have a double-espresso latte made within 5 minutes of turning it on. It is also the cleanest real espresso machine that I've ever used; the grinder doesn't leave coffee grounds anywhere and any small amounts of powder from the tamper collect straight down into the drip tray. The tamper is connected to the tamping lever with a spring which ensures that you don't over- or under-tamp the basket. The brewing has a perfect amount of automation, by which I mean that you still have a good control of the coarseness of the grind and the brewing temperature. One thing that really stands out to me is that it has a gauge that gives you feedback on the brewing pressure which gives you direct feedback to use for adjusting the grind coarseness for the specific beans that you're using. Selecting between a single or double shot is as easy as pressing a button and switching between espresso, Americano, or single serving of regular coffee in just a turn of a knob. For the Americano, it even automatically adds the right amount of hot water. The steam wand is really impressive because the control knob activates a pump that pulses water into the steam chamber which eliminates having to drain the wand of condensate and also ensures that there is the right amount of steam pressure. I could easily go on about this machine but suffice it to say that it really is that impressive! Highly recommend!",4 people found this helpful,No

For the longest time I still couldn’t justify spending this much on a coffee machine, however I’m here to say that the D’longhi Specialista is worth every penny plus some. Aesthetically, this machine looks excellent on your countertops. Performance wise, this expresso machine is impressive and makes some of the best coffee you will ever have. The grinder on the top is great so that I don’t have to use my extra coffee grinder and the coffee is always super fresh. It portions out the exact amount needed for a cup of expresso based on your selection. It is a bit tricky to get the hang of initially, but the instructions are clear (plus their are videos online) and once you get the hang of it, it’s not complicated at all. It’s just going from a Keuirg to a fancy machine like this takes a bit of practice. I can make a double shot of expresso and foam/ steam my milk and no longer need to make a coffee run to get the coffee I desire. You can even pick the temperature that you want which is nice. Machine is tall, so if you have an older 1950’s home with shorter cabinets you will need to measure to be sure it fits under cabinet. We are not done renovating yet so cabinets are still short and I have to remove grinder accessory to push it so it sits flush under cabinet.Overall, I would highly recommend this. It is an expresso machine that you will get your money’s worth out of and the quality is top notch.",3 people found this helpful,No

As is typical (I guess) it took a few days of tweaking to fine tune it to our coffee preferences, but even the trial and error ""fails"" were drinkable.A big plus is the tamping. It is manually done... sort of. Well, it's foolproof. Hand tamping can be a learned skill (that I never quite mastered), but this doesn't require that. There is a lever on the side of the machine (like a slot machine) which is mechanically set to tamp to the right density. Works great, even when I do it!The milk frother is the real deal (though I'm not the big user), and works well. We (they) can make just about any coffee drink known to man now.There are also auto settings for americanos and regular coffees, but we really stick to the double espresso setting.Love it!

In those years I have repeatedly tried to get good at making espresso (my partner is the espresso maker in our house).  Every time, I give up.Part of that is because it feels too easy to make a mistake and part of that is because its a huge mess. Particularly getting the grounds from the grinder, and then temping them down. I know that probably sounds finicky and whiny to folks who really love their espresso but I hate it and it led to our counters never feeling clean.The fact that grinding and tamping is in the machine is infinitely better. It keeps our counters cleaner but it also means that when we get new beans, my partner can do all the fiddling to get the exact right grind and dose and then we just leave it that way for me to make my own drinks. Despite using this machine for over a month, I still don't know the principles behind getting the perfect pull, and I am totally okay with that. I am making more espresso drinks now than I ever did with the Gaggia. I don't know if purists find that annoying, but the added features make it a lot more user friendly. I am even pretty confident if my mom came to visit, I could show her how to do it once and then she could just make her own drinks.SIZEBecause the photo I took has the Gaggia in front of the De'Longhi it makes the Gaggia look a bit bigger than it actually is. It is definitely narrower, but a tiny bit taller. It used to live under our cabinet and had a fairly small footprint on the counter. The De'Longhi is more substantial and can't fit under the counter. If you took off the lid to the bean hopper, you could totally put it under the counter but that would leave the beans unprotected from the air and they would go stale. If your cabinets are a bit taller you might be okay but I think they are generally hung at a standard height. Because of that, we have it half under the cabinet with the hopper sticking out. There's only one real place in our kitchen that it fits that way, which is right next to the sink. While I think I'd prefer to have it on the left side of the sink which is impossible to do, this is okay - not ideal but okay.OVERALLIn the end, this is a nice compromise for my partner and I. He's super into making espresso and getting things as perfect as possible. I'm not interested in that at all, I just want good coffee. This is an excellent way for both of us to have what we want without me having to bug him for every drink. I also use the hot water function for tea every morning which means I can put my kettle in the cabinet. There is a way to change how much water comes out with the hot water function I believe but I haven't fiddled with it yet.",2 people found this helpful,No

Having said that, this machine is beautiful and looks very expensive (which, it is).  It does not have too many parts to keep track of so that's good, but it does have more bits then I'm used to having to maintain, so it is a bit of an adjustment for me.  Putting it together out of the box wasn't that bad.This draws a LOT of power.  I don't know too much about these things but I know it blew a breaker right away.  I had to move appliances around in my kitchen for sure.I watched the videos on You Tube on how to work this machine and was enjoying several lattes right right away (I wanted to practice).  What I'm not really understanding is how to get the espresso I'm making match the diagram of a ""perfect"" espresso.  According to the pictures, I'm ""over-extracting"".  I've followed the instructions on how to correct this but nothing I do seems to change the look of the espresso coming out of the machine.  I guess it's no big deal because whatever this is making is delicious and a billion times better then the coffee I was making before, and I'll watch more videos and try and figure it out.I don't love:You can't froth milk and make espresso at the same time.  I guess that makes sense but I wish you could.There is no clearance for a decent sized mug.  I know us Americans make giant coffees, but hey, this is being sold to Americans so please make it a little but taller.  You can't remove the grill to give more clearance and make the machine work.There isn't much clearance for the frothing wand and it doesn't really move that much.  I don't feel like I can froth that much milk at a time.So basically, my main complaints right now are that I want to make giant beverages and this machine forces me to have portion/quantity control, which all is a #firstworldproblem!",6 people found this helpful,No

It had a bit of a learning curve, though. So first… The unpacking itself was impressive. The packaging was done so well I barely could get the tightly packed machine out of the attractive and well-designed box.  The machine and its parts were packed within some seriously dense foam and the smaller parts were packed within a much smaller well-designed box within the main box.  The machine and parts were wrapped in a plastic wrap that ensured that even a small blemish could not occur during packaging or shipping.  The box contained all the parts necessary to make all types of one- and two-shot drinks: 2 espresso filters to make a single or a double espresso, descaling tablets, a stainless-steel milk pitcher, and a cleaning brush, and single-use descaling solution.My friend and I removed the parts from the box and we began the very small amount of assembly and setting the unit up on my countertop.  I decided to fill the bean hopper before I installed it onto the top of the machine.  I lay out a cloth and filled the hopper and once I started to move the hopper to the top of the machine, beans fell out of the bottom of the hopper onto the countertop.  Yes, the bean hopper has an open bottom.  That made us realize that you cannot remove the bean hopper while there are beans in it and it is installed on the top of the machine because they will spill out over the top of the machine and onto your counter and floor.  The bean hopper must be visibly empty to remove it from the top of the machine or you must vacuum the beans out of the hopper before removal from the machine or later vacuum the beans off the counters and floor.After that fiasco, I decided I might want to refer to the Quick Start Guide for the remaining setup items.  If in doubt, read the manual/quick start guide. The Quick Start Guide is helpful but in no way takes the place of the full manual.  My initial test results were poor.  But, after reading the full manual and still getting less than optimal results in grinding and brewing, I decided that the full manual does not take the place of the many YouTube videos available to help with settings and operation of the machine.  After reviewing several YouTube videos, I got to action, made some adjustments, and had much better results.I really like the integrated grinder with Sensor Grinding Technology which provides consistent grinding and the Smart Tamping Station perfect pressure tamper.  It took some looking at YouTube videos for me to understand the grinding operation and how to adjust the grind to get the optimal grind for crema but once I tinkered with it and did several test grinds and test shots of espresso, I better understood the adjustment needed to get the optimal shot and crema with the coffee beans I was using.  I believe it will be easy to adjust the grind to suit any other coffee bean I might choose in the future should I decide to change the brand and type of bean.  Understanding and using the tamping mechanism was a breeze.My favorite part of the machine is the Immediate Start function.  Yes, you can power the machine on and start grinding immediately.  While you are grinding, the machine is readying itself for the brewing, preparing hot water for Americano and/or milk frothing.  It uses two independent heating systems so there is no waiting time between the espresso and the milk preparation.  The Advanced Latte System is super easy to use and I was able to make the perfect foam the very first time I tried.  There are two options for milk – foam and flat.  The only downside is I wish the stainless-steel milk frothing pitcher were larger.  It only holds enough for a small latte.  I will definitely be purchasing a larger pitcher.The overflow tray offers a warning by use of a piece of floating plastic that sticks up through the tray as the tray fills.  By the time this happens, the tray is difficult to remove and balance to get it to the sink to empty.  Since it is easy to remove and check for fullness, I would suggest you remove it and rinse it before it gets to this level.  Some of the buttons function to give water for rinsing and steam for other parts of the machine for cleaning.Overall, the great design of this espresso maker makes this piece of equipment fancy up my countertop.  It’s just a gorgeous amalgam of stainless steel that looks luxurious and professional at the same time.I do think some things could be better.  For one, the milk steamer pitcher is small – very small – only 12 oz.  That may sound big enough but it only holds enough milk and foam for a half-full mug of latte.  But that is an easy to resolve issue by purchasing a larger pitcher.  The bean hopper should have some type of mechanism that would allow it to be removed without losing all of the beans.  I would think some type of an operable lever that could close off the hopper might be a plus.  I also think the height of the bean hopper can be a problem with top cabinets that are not abnormally high.  Mine are about 17-1/2”, pretty close to new Cabinet standards, and the hopper lid does not fit on the hopper and fit under my cabinet.  It’s just a little too tall. I am using a small piece of plastic to cover the hopper when it is under the cabinet.  This could be a major problem for some because many cabinets are much lower than mine.  Also, the low upper cabinet might get in the way of operating the tamper lever.  In addition, the drip tray could use an early warning system instead of a “too late” system to notify the user that it is full.  And, lastly even though the water fill chamber holds quite a bit of water and the machine seems efficient in its use of the water, I would appreciate it if the water fill chamber was on the side for easier filling and access.Since my machine has only been in use a couple of days, I have not yet descaled.  I’m certain I will provide lots of use and therefore opportunity to see if it continues to function well.  If not, the machine has a one-year parts and labor warranty. I will amend this review if I find any major flaws or if this espresso maker does not hold up as I think it will.

A few years ago, I started working from home, and I got in the habit of going to Starbucks every morning to have a few minutes of human interaction before returning to my home office. By early August, I realized I had spent over $900 year to date on coffee, decided it needed to stop, and picked up a Keurig. It saved me a ton of money, but it wasn't nearly as good as espresso drinks. Enter the DeLonghi!Size/Space: First thing's first - before you jump in and order one yourself, figure out if you have anywhere you can put it! The unit itself is about 16"" wide, 16"" deep (with power cord), and 17-1/2"" high. The height is a big one, because the standard clearance from kitchen countertops to cupboards is 18"" - however, if the kitchen has been remodeled, the counter tops may have been upgraded to a thicker surface than older materials - I found my cupboards were only 17-1/4 to 17-1/2"" above the countertops, and it wasn't possible to slide this under the cupboards, so I had to find a new home. Now, even if you DID put it under the cupboards, you may find that you don't have sufficient access to remove the water reservoir on the back or access the bean hopper on top without pulling the unit out, which can be a little bit challenging in its own right. Height issues aside, you should be aware of the width - it's about 16"" wide total, but you can't sandwich this right up against a wall - you need clearance on BOTH. I'd say you need about 3-4"" minimum on either side to operate the tamper (left) and the knob for the steam wand (right). Minimum, I'd say you need 20"" of space, or it needs to be next to items on the counter that are shorter than the knobs (I have mine on one edge of the counter, and a knife block next to the machine that is short enough to easily operate the knob and steam wand)Setup: Initially, it can be a little challenging to figure out how to use it, but after doing it once, it's easy. Fill the Reservoir in back (filtered water recommended), Fill the bean hopper with your preferred espresso beans and turn the base of the hopper to the preferred grind setting (1-8, the guide that came with the machine suggested about a 4 for a medium roast which was a very good starting point). Turn the unit on with the Portafilter detached. The Portafilter has interchangeable single shot or double shot baskets - putting the basket in the first time is a little difficult because the springs are new, give it a good press/smack with your palm. Now, *IF* you're making a double shot, choose the ""x2"" button on the face of the machine first. Choose your extraction temperature on the face - it's indicated with 3 horizontal bars, and pressing the button cycles between 1, 2 and 3 bars - DeLonghi recommends 2 bars for Medium Roast beans. Finally, you'll have to adjust the ""dose"" (amount of ground beans) with a dial. You may need to waste some grind/beans the first time to get it right - start low and adjust the dose until, when tamped, the grind is even with the stamped ring inside the portafilter basket (adjusted for both single and double shot baskets)Daily use: Once you get that set up above dialed in, it's pretty easy - turn the machine on, insert the Portafilter - the machine will automatically grind the beans into the filter. Once the grind is finished, the machine will flash the tamping indicator to let you know to pull the arm to tamp the grind - just pull the arm to the indicated full pull line, and you're set. Remove the portafilter and insert it into the brew head, set your cup/mug under it, and press the ""Ok"" button (could have been called start). You'll have espresso within about 60 seconds of turning the machine on. I had a perfect shot the very first time I used the machine, and I was shocked. I worked at a Starbucks 25 years ago, and I vividly remember needing to adjust my tamping pressure a few times nearly every time I started a shift until I had it right. Now that I've been using this about 2 weeks, I continue to adjust a little, but I haven't yet had anything that resembled a *bad* shot - just ranging from good to perfect.Steaming: This is one area where I'm not thrilled with the machine. The dial on the right hand side of the machine has two settings - on or off. You turn the dial all the way until it clicks to start the steam, and then you click it off to stop, and starting the steam isn't instant - it builds pressure before releasing it. I would have preferred the knob work as an adjustable valve to control the flow. The other thing I don't love about the wand is that it is TOO vertical. 17.5° from vertical is as far as you can move it, so it's not as easy as I'd like to get a good vortex in the pitcher to incorporate the foam. I was able to adjust to this after a couple days, so if you get your technique down, it works fine. I think a small change to the wand would make this much nicer though.Side note: get yourself a clip-on dial thermometer for your pitcher for steaming milk. Using a thermometer will keep you from scorching your milk. They can be found, with clip, for as little as $9 - but it may be worth spending a few dollars more. This is a detail that I think DeLonghi is missing - it would be great if they included a clip with thermometer properly sized/fit for the included pitcher - the thermometer I bought is a bit long for my liking.Cleaning: This is perhaps the area that can be burdensome - I'm pretty much the only one drinking espresso in the house (unless my mother-in-law is visiting), so it can be a little time consuming to clean the Portafilter, Pitcher, and Steam Wand every morning after making myself a latté - but all told, the process takes 5 minutes - less time than stopping in a coffee shop, and much less once you factor in time getting there and back.Final Verdict: While the size of this machine caused some early consternation, once I found a home for it, I quickly grew to enjoy it. Early on, I doubted that I'd use it daily, but there's only been one day since setting it up that I didn't use it - and that was only because I woke up to a colossal work disaster that left no time for even the smallest of luxuries. The quality of the espresso has far exceeded my expectations! As for time and convenience, a few years ago I dated someone with a Nespresso machine - and I don't think there's a whole lot of time savings in using the Nespresso versus using this to make proper espresso - using the Nespresso pods probably saves 1-2 minutes, and most of that is really in clean-up.",One person found this helpful,No

Seriously perfect. Like, I almost cry with the first sip every. single. time. I also love the bean hopper and how easy the tamping process is with this. There are many challenges, however, with the rest of the machine. The first being that it draws so much amperage, that it flips the circuit almost every time I use it. We live in a new custom home with a brand new electric system. From the street, to the box, to the wiring. I’ve never had a breaker trip. Even when using multiple large appliances at the same time. It’s a pain. Next disappointment is the steam/wand. It’s really lame. It doesn’t build much steam power and it “pulses” the steam. It takes forever to froth milk. The wand doesn’t have a big enough range of motion to hold a bigger size pitcher comfortably. I ended up purchasing a countertop milk frother that is <<chef’s kiss!>> But again, how stupid that I need an additional step. The last thing is the interface. It’s totally and needlessly complicated. Please just give me 2 shots of espresso, an option for hot water after my shots are pulled and froth the milk quickly and creamy. I don’t want 5 additional and irrelevant buttons and lights to blink at me every morning, pre-coffee. Overall, I think this machine is trying to do too much so it fails to do the 1 thing perfectly. For the price of this machine, that’s a big bummer. But the espresso it makes, did I mention how incredible it tastes???",One person found this helpful,No

   This De'Longhi La Specialista Prestigio Espresso Machine is well made and a bit heavy because it is solid. The assembly is very minimal. There are two manuals and both must be referred to because the more colorful one doesn't have all the parts identified. Some of the better features include the filter holder assembly which has a long handle on it and locks into place and automatically initiates the grinding of the beans in the hopper. The big advantage is that when it locks into place, there is no place for ground coffee to fall out and make a mess. Also, the tamper is built in and the coffee is precisely tamped and since the tamping takes place with no place for the coffee to fall out, again there is no coffee ground mess. One can make either coffee or espresso with this machine.  In my pictures you can see one cup with coffee and the other with espresso.  The grind of the beans can be adjusted allowing for different strength and smoothness. The frothier can be set to specific settings so the cup does not have to be moved around to get the desired results. The espresso maker can be set to self clean with steaming hot water. Excess water runs down into the tray and a red plastic pieces floats up through the grill to show you when it is time to empty the water out of the tray. This machine gives professional results without having to have professional technique. This is the most user friendly espresso machine I have ever operated.",One person found this helpful,No

Parts of the machine are literally flimsy plastic. If you can see this from the outside, I can only imagine how much plastic is on the inside of this machine. The tamper is PLASTIC, the lid on the grinder is PLASTIC and the outside of the machine dents easily and is just plain CHEAP. It’s all a facade! After spending $800 on a machine you would think they can spring for materials that are more than aluminum and plastic!After 2 months of daily use (maybe 3 or 4 shots a day) it started leaking from the spout that goes into the drip tray. I would wake up to a puddle of water every morning. In addition... The water doesn’t get hot enough, the grinder is no where near the quality that it needs to be to make the kind of espresso that you think you are paying for. Bottom line is there is always something wrong with this machine and no one could ever figure out what it is with those cryptic symbols they have popping up! DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!",3 people found this helpful,No

Other coffee makers and espresso makers that we had were definitely not this pretty.While it is a beautiful machine it does not come without a learning curve, dont expect to press a button out of the box and have a delicious coffee.We have been using this for a few weeks now and it has taken a few tries to get our cup of the coffee the way we like it. It was slightly challenging but we have never had a machine like this either. You will need to learn the knobs and how they function with your preferences (espresso, americano etc). I think the hardest part was figuring out how many beans and how not to overfill the tamper. It takes less than a minute to make a delicious cup! You can also just dispense hot water which is super nice for a quick cup of tea.But once you get it down it is the best cup of coffee or espresso ever - like your own cafe! I know for my husband and I this will save us money in the long run.I do recommend buying quality beans and filtered water but chances are if you are considering this machine you would do that anyway.You also need to keep this machine clean and clean it regularly to keep it performing best.From start to finish - opening the box to cleaning the machine to my first cup took about 45 minutes - and it was time well spent. I highly recommend this machine and am looking forward to making some great coffee and espresso.",3 people found this helpful,No

This over eight hundred dollar machine is laden with plastic, rubber, and inexpensive electronics inside.  Looking at the materials used I can't help but wonder what kind of chemicals leach into my coffee with every use of this machine.  Anyone else having water sensor issues make sure the magnetic float inside the reservoir is not stuck down when full.  If not then likely the reed switch has gone bad like mine.  Tear down is somewhat complex, parts are cheap.  About 4 hour and thirty bucks DIY repair job or another two hundred for pro repair.

A much better all around experience than Breville,"My husband bought this for my 65th birthday.  I used it a lot and really enjoyed the espresso.  I did not like the fact that the hopper was stationery.  If you put too much coffee in, you had to grind it because you aren't supposed to leave the coffee in. That before I realized I could weigh it.  I returned it and bought the Breville Barista Express. I made a BIG mistake. I watched videos of people who complained that you couldn't use a single walled filter. So I returned the LaSpecialista and guess what, I can't make a good cup of Espresso with the single-walled filter no matter what with the Barista Express.  What a dope I am. The La Specialista is a much nicer machine.  The tamper, the rack to make the espresso cup closer to the dispenser which makes for less splashing.And this is why I should not have returned the LaSpecialista. DeLonghi's customer service is fantastic and Breville doesn't have customer service. I have waited on the phone twice for 4+hours both times. I mean really and have never gotten a response. Never. Now my descaling process does not work. My poor husband wasted all that money on a machine that I will never be able to get serviced.",2 people found this helpful,No

After many years of faithful service, my replacement Gaggia gave up, so I was looking for an espresso machine that could provide ample pressure (and a grinder). Upon unboxing, I was impressed by the solid build quality and overall looks of the La Specialista; is it gorgeous on the countertop and has a bit of a 1950s vibe to it.Pros: Two independent heating systems (one for milk, one for coffee).  You can tamp directly in the filter holder.  The advanced latte system lets you choose between flat (hot milk only) or foam. It has three presets for espresso, Americano, and coffee.Be sure to read the instruction manual before attempting setup. It's worth watching all the DeLonghi how-to videos on YouTube first before setting up for the first time (especially about using the built-in grinder as this is my first machine that has one, and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve).  And you may want to experiment with the coffee bean grinder (any whole coffee beans will work; it doesn't have to be ""espresso"" blend!) to find the grind that's best for you.This is like upgrading to a Ferrari; absolute beauty! I loved the quick startup (my previous Gaggia took about 10 minutes to prime) and the quality of the crema / coffee (if you are a fan of flavored drinks, you can also make your own mochas or add flavored syrups; I loved the fact that this makes fantastic flat whites). Absolutely gorgeous foam, too.Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the La Specialista and look forward to many years of excellent lattes and cappuccinos!",2 people found this helpful,No
