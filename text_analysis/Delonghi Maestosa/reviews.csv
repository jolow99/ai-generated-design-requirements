Delicious, smooth, full flavour and effortless maintenance. We use one of the hoppers for espresso beans and the other for decaf beans. Easily the best coffee machine we’ve ever purchased.",,

The espressos and cappuccinos are awesome, the milk froth a delight, and the range of drinks that it makes is mind blowing. My only issue is with the Coffee Link app which needs to be more stable and fast.",,

Maintaining this machine is fuss free. From near empty water tank and topping up water, notifications were display to inform you of the events even when you are pouring water to the brim.

Never regret getting this machine",,

Quick to heat up.
Great how we can use two different beans just choose in menu which one you want to use
Very clear screen and very easy to navigate and my kids love the app as they can make drinks from another room.
Very happy overall cannot speak highly enough of this machine.",,

To my humble opinion, there is no comparison with other domestic coffee machines in the market. This machine goes above and beyond.",,

This machine makes every kind of coffee you could ever ask for plus it makes hot milk, iced coffees or chocolate and hot chocolate! This machine is very easy to use, the only thing you have to worry about is picking what kind of coffee you'd like to drink. The machine itself will do everything for you, it will show you each step it takes from grounding the beans to frothing the milk.
It's very easy to care for and clean, what impressed me the most about this particular machine is the Crema it produces! not once but every time you make a coffee! I personally like my coffee hotter than most people and once I turned off the energy saving tab, wow what a difference it made, now i have my coffee exactly how I like it hot! This particular coffee machine is pure pleasure to use and to drink from. I absolutely love this machine, if you too love your coffee as much as I, then don't look past the Maestosa coffee machine from DeLonghi it's worth every cent!!",,

After our in-home barista service, I learnt even more about the machine and its capabilities. My only disappointment was that we were promised a gift pack upon purchase of the machine, which was given to us but was short of the items promised. I understand the gift pack was a bonus, however, it was still disappointing.
Still love the machine though !!",,

I literally go to sleep at night looking forward to my morning coffee. We purchase our beans from our local cafe and after adjusting the grind and a few other settings, we now enjoy the taste of our local cafe coffee at home. It also creates the perfect creamy milk just like barista made. We love that we have the choice of the 2 bean hoppers which means we can enjoy a different coffee in the afternoon than we do in the morning. We make sure we clean all the components thoroughly once a week which is very simple & takes about 10 minutes, it’s well worth it to get the consistent great tasting coffee. We have made our own custom coffees through the app although the coffees that are programmed by default are amazing too, our favourite is the Latte Macchiato. An interesting fact, the Maestosa is man made rather than by machine which is very cool knowing that a person has actually built it. Ooh and another thing, our 2 year old loves the baby-chinos which we customised to his very own profile. Although it is an expensive purchase, it is such a great investment and looks great in the kitchen too. We can’t speak highly enough of the Maestosa.",,

I bought one for my small office. Everyone was very happy about this purchase.

So far I noticed only 2 disadvantages.
1) I also bought Delonghi ecam 650.85 for home about 6 months ago. It was 600$ cheaper then Maestosa EPAM 960.75. I think that Maestosa maks better coffee and functionalities such as preparing 2 cappuccino at the same time is great. But ECAM 650.85 has some great functionalities that are missing in Maestosa. For example absent of cup warmer in Maestosa. Another example is that in Ecam 650.85 you can set auto-start time for your coffee machine. I think for such a big amount of money Maestosa should have all possible features that DeLonghi can offer.
2) The android application is not working at all. It can't connect to the internet. When you try to connect it to Maestoso it says that ""device isn't recognized"" or something like that and app need internet to download Maestosa data :). I hope someday DeLonghi will produce wifi adapter for its devices and will rewrite its mobile applications.

Overall it is a very good coffee machine and I can recommend it but I really upset that one of the main and so much promoted feature - Mobile Application, isn't working at all.",,
