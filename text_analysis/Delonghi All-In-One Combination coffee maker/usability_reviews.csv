1,"We are an Italian-English family with high expectations on both espresso and filter coffee - having purchased several machines which did not last in the past, we think this machine is EXCELLENT - still going strong after a couple of years, I also bought one for my Mum.  Customers who complained about the filter jug dribbling - at first I did not know what they meant, but if you fill the jug right up to the top for a lot of filter coffee, then yes, it strangely dribbles, but otherwise if you are making up to 4/5 mugs it is fine.  Otherwise the machine makes excellent espresso and using it every day for cappuccino (filtering water in advance) it is still going very strong.  Worth nothing that the anti-scale filter is for the filter coffee side only, there is no equivalent on the espresso side, so worth using filtered water on this side for long life (although I am often lazy and don't, and it still works fine).  Of particular note is the excellent cappuccino frother - really easy to take off and rinse after each use, without having to dismantle all pieces - the best and most practical design I have seen yet.  This machine is well-worth the money.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.6923315525054932, 0.22719624638557434, 0.0431782566010952, 0.03729395195841789]"
2,"I bought this machine just under 2 years ago with high hopes - it appears to be a great combination with filter and espresso in one.  The making of filter coffee is excellent with an easy front-loading water tank.  I prefer paper filters - much more hygienic and less likely to ""taste"" the coffee.  Coffee tastes good and the hot plate keeps the brewed coffee very hot - a big improvement on my last machine.I only wish the espresso process was as efficient.  The design doesn't allow you to prepare the milk whilst you're making the espresso - it's either one or the other so either the milk or the espresso is cooling whilst you're doing the other part.  The milk steamer nozzle is very short and awkwardly placed and really only allows a small container under.The steamer stopped working about 6 months ago - simply fizzled out, despite my having cleaned all the nozzles after every use.  There is no help whatsoever on the DeLonghi website so I tried everything I could think to unblock the tube - it sputtered into intermittent life a few times but has now stopped working completely.  The steamer is inside the machine so there is no access and it cannot be dismantled to clean (assuming that is the problem).  End of story and very disappointing that this should happen to a machine that's less than 2 years old - I'm now left with an expensive filter coffee maker. My advice - look elsewhere.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.33753296732902527, 0.28597986698150635, 0.2413538247346878, 0.1351333111524582]"
3,"This is a nice machine and I've been very happy with the basics. The drip brew is pretty quick and the tank is very easy to fill without risk of overflowing. The swing out section for the coffee filter and water makes day to day operation simple. The espresso maker works well and I find it very handy for a quick cup. I haven't tried using the pods as regular ground coffee is simple enough to use with it.On the downside, I find the jug extremely prone to spillage when pouring. Unlike most coffee pots, this does not have a curved spout. This leads to me often spilling water when filling up the machine or pouring coffee. After quite a bit of use, I'm getting the hang of holding it at a slight angle so it doesn't spill quite as much!The one big disappointment I found was the milk frother. It isn't very powerful, so takes a very long time to correctly froth and heat the milk. What I also find strange about this part is that I cannot heat the water for an espresso and steam for the milk frother at the same time. This means making a latte or cappuccino very tricky unless I'm missing something! You have to make one and then wait for the other part to heat up before use. So you end up with luke warm milk or a stewed espresso.For the money, I'd have expected a bit more on that front. But if you want a sturdy, well made machine and don't worry about milk frothing it is a decent buy.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.5169006586074829, 0.35783612728118896, 0.06279951333999634, 0.06246364116668701]"
4,"I've just replaced my coffee maker with this one. The instruction booklet makes it look somewhat complicated to use, but that is not the case. The machine is very easy to use and makes brilliant and HOT coffee.The espresso feature uses about a third of the ground coffee of my old machine and the taste is great.Filling it with water is really easy, especially the espresso tank.All the parts of the machine are very accessible with no 'fiddly' bits.A top rate machine at very reasonable price, good value for money.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.6691137552261353, 0.25570347905158997, 0.04672585427761078, 0.028456900268793106]"
5,"This is a great machine - the pot + espresso sides make it very handy indeed. The espresso side will only do one double espresso at a time if you want it at high pressure. That said, it seems to push water through the coffee after its run out of pressure quite well, so unless you're a princess, you'll get enough out in one go. The milk steamer seems to work really well, although getting milk frothy takes a bit of practice. The pot side seems to work pretty nicely too - it takes size 4 filter papers, but comes with about 5 of them so you can get going right away.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.7654168605804443, 0.2178345024585724, 0.008550872094929218, 0.008197755552828312]"
6,"I bought this item for my neighbor 7/02/12I was given this as a gift in dec 2011, I was originally so pleased with the product that I bought a friend one for a 40th birthday.Our pleasure was short lived.The tank is difficult to fill without getting water everywhere and the steam is more like a slightly wet puff.Then horror of horrors,my neighbor appeared last week, and told me his started shorting out the sockets throughout the house.Mine has been doing it as well we discovered.Would not buy it again.Contacted manufacturer,surprise,surprise they don't want to know","['not durability', 'not usability', 'usablity', 'durability']","[0.549920380115509, 0.221515491604805, 0.12074387818574905, 0.10782025009393692]"
7,"Not great! Started to fail after about 6 months and blow fuses in the main board. Also when the top with the water and coffee is closed it catches on the coffee jug and pulls it out of position. Lastly, whenever it pours, however carefully you try, it dribbles coffee and is not fit for purpose imho. For crying out loud don't the designers ever test out their work???? My advice if you're thinking of buying? Don't.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.6775268316268921, 0.23994223773479462, 0.05425314977765083, 0.028277847915887833]"
8,"I looked at a number of bean to cup machines before buying this, but they were too complicated and also noisy and temperamental according to reviews. This little machine is simple to use and flexible, especially as I can use the filter part when I have a group of people visiting. The espresso side works really well including the steamer. I'm planning on buying a grinder for the full bean to cup experience, at a fraction of the automated price.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.7978613376617432, 0.14231804013252258, 0.04206693172454834, 0.017753658816218376]"
9,The instructions suggest there's a water filter in the espresso-side of this coffee maker however ours didn't come with it. We wrote back to Amazon to question this but the only recourse we had was to send our back in favour of another. Another came a few days later (Amazon's returns/replacement policy is very very good) but also without the filter so we tried it without the filter - it works perfectly well but the instructions are misleading.Christmas present for my wife. She's very happy with it.,"['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.3160770535469055, 0.2670404613018036, 0.26334062218666077, 0.15354184806346893]"
