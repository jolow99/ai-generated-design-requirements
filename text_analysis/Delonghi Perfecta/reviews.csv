I have no complaints about that. Taste is relative, so I can understand how some may like it less than others, but I have no complaints about the coffee. The frothed milk is perfect, the coffee tastes just like it should. We use it every day, and we all but stopped buying any coffee from espresso stands.I updated this review to 3 stars in fairness for just how much we actually enjoy using this unit. However, I'll leave the terrible experience we had with the customer support below for reference.I think there should be more to a great product that it's nominal performance. Quality is also defined by reliability and customer service. DeLonghi boasts striving for excellence, but they fail miserably.My machine arrived in intact condition. Worked great out of the box. However, after less than six weeks of use the grinder failed. It started suddenly making this terrible rattling noise and stopped actually grinding the coffee. First, I shot them an e-mail to ask if there's a quick fix. They replied 10 days later asking for information to process a service request. I sent them the invoice, serial numbers and all they asked for and they never replied back. After a week or so, we called the support line and they eventually sent us a box and a shipping label - it arrived after other 10 days. We shipped the machine. Here's where it gets interesting. 4 weeks passed without any update so we contacted them again. There was some lame excuse about them moving their service center from one location to another and after further questioning they admitted they have no idea where our machine was. It's been several weeks and they still ""cannot find it"". They... lost it.UPDATE: After several more calls, they eventually found it and shipped it to us, this time, lo and behold, priority. Still, it took about 60 days from when it broke down until we were able to use it again.Caveat emptor! Consider this very seriously. If your product works and keeps working you'll be fine. But know that if it breaks, there will be no easy help available and you'll waste lots of time and you'll gain lost of aggravation to get it fixed.",39 people found this helpful,Yes

I mailed it FedEx to The Dallas service center unsure when I'd ever see it again.Today I was shocked to get a call from the delivery guy that my beloved espresso machine was left on my porch. Everything works great, problem solved. I am so impressed. I know super automatics can be finicky and I've heard horror stories. Thankfully I didn't have to experience one. Thank you Delonghi!Otherwise for those looking we love this machine. Espressos and tall coffees are at the ready. Milk drinks, lattes and cappuccinos are perfect. The milk container works great and froths every time. Just don't leav milk in it. It must not be air tight and it gets funky quick even in the fridge.I would this machine again twice over. I love it.

It's a member of the family, as much as an inanimate object can be, anyway.  Maybe, more like a pet.  A bit of a needy pet. It enhances your life and does so much to make you happy, that you are happy to give it the care that it demands lol. So, here's what I've come to expect with the machine: It dies every two years. It was purchased at Williams & Sonoma with their lifetime guarantee.  So for the first couple two-year cycles, I was able to just take it back and exchange it. Finally, they told me I had gotten my last exchange, and marked the receipt likewise. I figured, fair enough. They had been pretty decent about it up til then. So I went the warrantee route (that particular exchange still had a few months left on the two-year warranty.)  Delonghi sent me a box and directions where to send it. That was a joke. The repair people were, anyway.  It broke again in just a few weeks.  After that, I started shipping it to a more reputable repair outfit for every bi-annual breakdown. After some time, my husband said I couldn't do that anymore (it was at least $200 each time.) That ushered us into the phase of you-tube videos and buying parts online.  That worked at least once, as I recall.  Now it's broken down again, and it might be its last life.  We tried one DIY repair, which flopped.  I was actually on here considering buying another one, looking at reviews, and decided to chronicle my experience for future buyers.  Why am I looking at another Delonghi Perfecta? Why would I want to buy a mere coffeemaker for the price of a major appliance, except that it breaks down like clockwork every two years? Like I said, it's kind of like my pet, lol, that needs to go to the vet every two years.  I actually love that machine.  It's been a part of our lives for so long now.",3 people found this helpful,No

It should pay for itself in a year if you enjoy great coffee often. We caught a good deal on this and have been happy. We have had it 6 months now and put through 300 cappuccinos according to the statistics recorded by the machine. The taste is excellent.  The machine easy to use and no issues so far. We use distilled water to avoid descaling which can be expensive if using their solution.  We use glass coffee cups with wire like handles that we bought online and it is nice to see the cappuccino as it swirls in the cup and to see its different layers of milk, foam and coffee!  Use whole coffee beans made for espresso for best taste. Know that a latte is more milk than foam and vise versa for a cappuccino. And also know that a macchiato is just hot milk with just enough coffee to leave a mark (""marked milk"" hence the name) on top of the milk. The name cappuccino is an Italian reference to a monks cap, or hat.  Buy some shakers for cinnamon, cocoa etc. know that nutmeg isn't too good for cappuccinos as it it bitter and kills the foam. Use it for spiced drinks or maybe chocolate drinks.",13 people found this helpful,No

I am through buying any product from them, after my experience with this espresso machine.  I bought this espresso machine in early 2014.  This was machine was to replace a ESAM 3300 which lasted 7 years, and was beginng to show its age.  We were very happy with it, but updated for the frother capability in this model.This model was purchased through Amazon.  As additional prodection, I also purchased the Delonghi extended warranty for $150 not long after I purchased this espresso maker.About two months ago, after more than 2 years of good service, the pump which produces the frothed milk has become noticably weak.  So much so, that it no longer makes a cappuchino the way it used to when we first bought the macine,  The machine will froth the milk about 50% of the required volume, and then the stream of milk slows down and stops.  A message indicator states the coffee grinder must be for a coarser grind.  Not sure what the grind setting of the coffee has to do with the stream of frothed milk.  Changed the setting, but no change.I called the customer service line and they tried to help me troubleshoot the issue, but the end result was for the technician to advise that the machine had to be serviced.When i provided the certificate number of my Delonghi extended warranty, they told me that is was invald, since I did not buy the machine from an authorized dealer - mistake number 1 - do not buy this type of appliance from Amazon.Second, the technican told me that they would not be able to refund my extended warranty - no reason given. - mistake #2.Based on this experience, I am never going to buy anything again from Delonghi.  I mistakenly assumed that that they were more like the reputable high end manufacturers like, Kitchenaid, Le Creuset, and All Clad, who stands by their products and prompty addresses any defects.However, what really irks is their failure to refund the $150 paid for the warranty they refuse to honor.This is a sign of a company with a poor reputation which does not stand by their products.  Next time I buy an espresso machine, I will likely purchase one made by Miele, given their reputation for solid workmanship and design.",8 people found this helpful,No

Get up in the morning, press a button, and instant cappuccino.  Then the milk frother started acting up. Not as foamy, not a steady stream, etc.  Called DeLonghi, and customer service was great.  We talked through the issues, and they determined it must be a problem with the foamer lid mechanics.  ""We'll send you out a whole new lid"" they said. Great, I thought. Awesome customer service, which it should be since it was so expensive, and less than a year old (considering the 2 year warranty). Well, 2 months later, and 3 phone calls later with lots of promises, still no foamer top.  I finally went out and bought a high end Breville foamer at Williams Sonoma. It works great, and gets the milk much hotter than the DeLonghi did.  We LOVE it, and it's fast and never fails. We also bought a small Nespresso, since I've started drinking decaf, and found it was too hard to switch back and forth with the DeLonghi (the rest of the family wants caffeine). We've found this method to be easier, better, and more versatile (everyone gets the coffee they want). And it takes up much less counter space. If only DeLonghi would send me the lid to the foamer so I can sell the whole unit on Craigslist before Christmas!!",8 people found this helpful,No

The machine makes decent coffee, heavy on the caffeine, but as mentioned in other reviews, it is not hot enough.  The milk frother isn't worth much as the milk is barely frothed and is very inconsistent; some days the frother works, some days it doesn't, even though my milk (whole) always comes straight from the refrigerator.  To battle this after 4 years, I bought a $100 Nestle Aeroccino which makes lovely froth for a real cappuccino.  I cannot speak for the Latte milk setting as I have never used it.  As for everyday use, I find the machine finicky; error messages (including cleaning messages) will pop up mid-cycle, and the machine will not resume where it was in the cycle, I will have to start the drink over.  Cleaning is relatively easy, but it must be done by hand.  I used to stick the milk container (bottom only) in the dishwasher, but it warped, and I was forced to buy a new expensive container.  I have also had the machine spout coffee through the bottom, but this problem was easily fixed with a shop-vac.All in all, the coffee is decent, but not worth the price of the machine.

At, the time, this was a new unit/model; and service parts had to be specially ordered  --- so, it took approximately three months before the machine was delivered back to me.  Any time I phoned DeLonghi, during this process, they has a status report as to what was going on; and, as it was quite a while that the machine was not in use by me, DeLonghi , even extended my warranty by the amount of time I had to go without the machine.

While I would prefer them hotter, the temperature is livable.  I was replacing a Krupps coffee maker that I had used for ~13 years and it was starting to show its age.  In all fairness, I think I only descaled it once over that time and I live in an area with very hard water.  Out of the box, this unit worked great, although it is a very needy appliance (I want water, empty the grounds).  I descaled it as soon as it told me it needed it (about every 2 months).  About a month ago, it decided that it couldn't push water through the grounds.  After dissembling and cleaning everything possible, I called for service.  I thought that I was fortunate in that there was 1 month left on the warranty.  After ~45 minutes on hold, being told every 30 seconds how much they value me, I got through to a person who said it would have to be sent in for service.  I sent in my proof of purchase (good thing Amazon keeps these records) and heard nothing.  I called back after a week, another 30 minutes on hold; they accepted my proof of purchase and said that they would send me a box and shipping label to the nearest service center.  Ten days later, the box arrived.  No shipping label, no packing instructions.  To date, I have called 5 times, each starts with a minimum of 30 minutes on hold.  I have spoken to supervisors and still I have a box with a broken coffee maker sitting in my kitchen.  This is absolutely the first and last DeLonghi product I will every purchase.  I have no faith that they will ever fix it.  At this point, I am at my wits ends and am ready to drag them into small claims court.  I don't usually post reviews and have written off many reviews as competitors trying to talk down the competition.  Feel free to write me off as bad luck, working for the competition or simply crazy, but if you want to save yourself grief, avoid this company at all costs.",6 people found this helpful,Yes

The beans would sometimes jam together creating a pocket between the grinder and the beans at the top of the funnel.  The result was inconsistant cups of coffee.  To get around this I would manually agitate the beans with the rake that came with the machine.  Not exactly ""Superautomatic"".The 5500 however is awesome!  The grinder and funnel area vibrate causing and automated agitation system.  The taste of the coffee has been consistant every time.  It has a lot of nice features that the compact didn't making it light years better.  You do pay a premium, nearly twice the price but it is worth every penny.  I love the completely automatic cappuccino function.  Just push a button and the machine froths the milk then transfers it to your cup.  Then the expresso mode kicks in completing the process.  Absolutely amazing!I read a lot of reviews and no matter which one you buy you will eventually run into maintenance problems.  To alleviate this I purchased the 3 year warranty from amazon.

I call up to the delonghi customer service and they told me how and how to close the door but neither of them will work. When I first open the package, the door was already opened so they told me there might be something wrong with the door itself.They told me I can exchange it with amazon or they can send me a box to return it to them.(They are just not nice enough to be a customer service agent, talked like I owe them money). Well, I decided to call up to amazon to see what they can do, and I didn't expected I can get the replacement that quick! The new one is already on the way to my place when I am tying this review!! All I need to do is to put it back to the box and wait for the UPS guy come and pick it up. Awesome work, Amazon. But for the machine I will rate it for one star right now due to this door issue.

The DeLonghi has fewer moving parts, a much smaller infuser/brew unit, shorter distance for the grounds to travel and this is CRITICAL, it has grind to cup, meaning it brews the coffee you grind, which many machines do not. It's a dirty little secret, that many machines will grind coffee, but push out the grinds from the previous cycle and store the grinds for the next cup.I found that once I understood the controls, they were simple to use, but it does take a ten to twenty minute investment to fully understand them. After that, it is simple and I find an elegant machine.In terms of the complaints about this not making a steaming hot cup of coffee, well, this is an espresso machine, the milk you add it to can be as hot as you like.I don't think you can make a better espresso with any machine, you have as much control as you like over strength, water, beans, etc.After a year of use, the machine is cleaner than the Gaggia, fewer ground going where they don't belong, and works and looks like new.

Since my husband had become such a fan of espresso over the past two years, instead of replacing it with the same simple model type we thought we would upgrade in the world of espresso.  We were a bit surprised at the price gap.  There is either cheaper or expensive.  After mulling over whether or not to spend the extra $900 on a bean to cup machine we decided to take the plunge.  We bought the Delonghi Perfecta ESAM 5500.B and brought it home.  It is sharp looking, I must say that and it matches my Samsung black and stainless microwave oven perfectly.  After setting all the options to our liking, I made our first cups of espresso and handed it to my husband.  He gave it a thumbs up saying it was way better than our little manual machine.  The taste and texture was that of the cafes he relied on for a good espresso.  I did adjust the temperature setting higher as we like our coffee piping hot.  After using it for a few weeks now I am pleasantly pleased as how simple it is to use.  I no longer have to clean the counter of coffee grinds, drips and milk after each use.  The coffee grinder and its mess have all been put away.  My mocha is hot and tasty and I programmed the machine to fill my large cup the way I like it with one button operation.

I chuckled at the other review that outlined the 15 minute process for making a cup of coffee...sometimes the timing just works out that way and it seems that every time you hit the button, something needs filling or cleaning. It DOES take some patience to operate this thing at times, but overall I find that it makes unsurpassed crema with the right beans (better even than the local shop where I buy them) and with the right type of milk, makes wonderful froth.I was plagued for quite some time with the ""Close Door!"" error message, often resulting in a hopeful/fearful slamming of the service door which resolved the problem only about 20% of the time. Today, I finally grew tired of the workarounds (mostly, having to squeeze the machine from front and back until it finished my cappucino) and took all the innards out to explore. What I found was the inward protrusion on the door appears to mate with a slot above the infuser/puck disposal area to sense that the door is closed. Since I didn't want to leave adhesive residue, I wrapped some thread tape around the protrusion (plastic flat piece about the width of a thumb), closed the door gently, and it now seems to properly sense door orientation. Hopefully this solves what seems to be a common problem. If you've been experiencing this same problem, please reply if this works for you.Overall, love the machine, and while it has taught me quite a bit of patience, it always rewards with a deliciously caffeinated treat. -1 star for the poor QC",One person found this helpful,No

Recently, after 13 years of service,  my Saeco Vienna Deluxe gave up the ghost.  My daughter bought a DeLonghi Magnifica, and gave it kudos all around.  I decided, even after the divided reviews, to get the DeLonghi Perfecta.  I also decided to buy it at Costco, so if I was to have trouble with it, I could return it to Costco, no questions asked.It was pretty easy to set up and after trying several times, I got a somewhat decent espresso.  After a few days things started getting a little complicated.  I thought it was really only matter of getting the kinks out, or getting used to it ,and finding the right combination to getting that perfect cup of espresso, and cappuccino.  My wife couldn't get the hang of it, and after several problems, my son gave up on it.  I persevered for a week, and finally after 7 days I have returned the Perfecta to Costco.Here are the reasons for giving up on the DdLonghi ESAM5500M:1. Grounds container has to be emptied often, due to the warning light going on, and the machine stops working.2.  Grounds spill outside of the container in the machine and the whole tray has to be removed and cleaned3. Much of the freshly ground coffee falls outside the filter cup, behind the tray, necessitating cleaning the inside back of the machine.4. Have to fill the water container often, because of the many rinse cycles the machine uses.5. Inconsistent strength levels of ground coffee even when programmed for ""my cup""6. Bean Container warning light goes on, machine stops working, even when it's more than half full.  Have to fill it up.7. Door open warning light goes on, machine stops working, even when the door is properly closed.  Have to sometimes close it hard.8. Lastly....and the last straw.... Freshly ground coffee made it's way up the single serving funnel to the top of the machine and overflowed.IN CONCLUSION:The coffee is almost always watery and gives a mediocre serving one out of 5 cups.Much too much freshly ground coffee is used up to achieve that one cup.It's a high maintenance machine with low yield results.The DeLonghi ""Perfecta"" is ""Imperfecta""........To us it is a total fail.",4 people found this helpful,No

Probably the biggest reason I say it's not the greatest coffee maker is after it makes whatever cup you want, the coffee is really not a hot cup of coffee (even w/hottest setting).

I had consideed the Jura Capresso Impressa C9 One Touch, but feared having to spend money on their custom cleaning tablets.I chose this Delonghi model after extensive research and after reading Consumer Reports' very good review of it (77 out of 100, and the best out of a few models they tested). Also, according to Delonghi, as a brand, they have fewer returns than any other brand. I also liked the fact that this unit, unlike my Saeco one, frothed milk automatically.THE GOOD: Delonghi doesn't require costly proprietary cleaning tablets for routine cleaning.  The LED Readout is clear and operation user friendly.  Frothing is very good with non-fat, 1%, 2%, and even soy milk.  The milk frothing pitcher is very convenient to use and clean.  Water filters for this Delonghi are as low as $1.45 online.  Warranty is 2 years vs. 1 year for Saeco.THE BAD:  Coffee is lukewarm. I measured the espresso at 165F degrees and the cappuccinos at about 115F degrees.  The pull-down dispenser doesn't come down low enough for small (short) 4 oz. espresso/demitasse cups (see detail below).The dispenser component that sits above the cups and that extracts coffee doesn't come down low enough to prevent 'bubbling' when coffee 'splashes' into a cup. This is minor, however, and I should note that the coffee produced has excellent 'crema'.Want hotter coffee? Brew into a Pyrex type glass measuring cup with a spout and then microwave the cup on 'high' for about 30-60 secs. Then it will be very hot and can be put into an insulated commuter cup to stay warm for as long as those who have stated that they have cool coffee when after using this unit and once they get to their office. If you think this extra step is too inconvenient, then think of what a pain it is to froth milk until 180F degrees and then make espresso, as I did before I got this unit. The auto-milk feature shaved 5 mins off of my daily latte making routine. I have owned this unit for about 3 months with no problems thus far. I would by this unit again and for the best price, would buy it here on Amazon or at Bed, Bath, and Beyond (with the latter's 20% off coupon).",One person found this helpful,No

One of the best things is that there is no mess. My friend has a separate grinder and non-automatic espresso machine. There are coffee grounds everywhere and it makes an awful mess. The Delonghi makes no mess and it is easy to clean.Some have mentioned that the coffee is not hot enough. Maybe this is an American preference. From my time in Italy I noticed that they serve espresso drinks (including milk drinks) much less hot than what we are used to here. The hotness of the coffee has not been an issue for me. I followed the instructions to make the coffee and milk hotter and if I feel the need I pop my cup in the microwave for a few seconds. One thing I do that works great is to pre-heat the cups by filling them with water and putting them in the microwave for a minute or two. But basically, I don't think espresso drinks are supposed to be as hot as an American cup of drip.I also use purified water.

Even though we purchased the machine in South Africa, and even though I had no receipt (and the warranty had already expired), they repaired it with no questions asked. Granted, it took about a month, something other reviewers had complained about. Considering that the original part had to be sourced from Italy, this wasn't so bad in my opinion. I got several calls during that time giving me an update on the status. The machine eventually was fixed at no cost to us, and I even imagine that the one feature I had always complained about, the cappuccinos not turning out hot enough, is actually much better than before. I've added a star to my rating for these reasons. If the coffee was even hotter (or if there was a better way to adjust the temperature) I'd give this machine 5 stars. Not having it for a month made me realize what I was really missing.2nd Update Jan 2014:If you have encountered the problem of ""CLOSE DOOR"" popping up on your machine repeatedly, you need to read this. Apparently this is a very common problem. It is totally annoying, but it is also very easily fixed. I have to give a huge shout-out to the Coffee Boss in North Carolina (one of deLonghi's repair centers) for walking me through the steps one by one and enabling me to fix it without having to send it in. The first reason your door might pop open or give you that error code is that there might be coffee grounds in the back behind the tray. Make sure you clean it out periodically, best with a vacuum cleaner. The second reason might be that the infuser (the cylinder thing with the two red tabs that you can remove from the machine) is not sliding up and down easily, forcing coffee grounds to spill into the machine instead of into the infuser. Take it out by pressing those two red tabs, rinse it off, then push the disk all the way down, then put some vaseline onto the walls of the cylinder so it slides more easily. But the number one reason the door will pop open (or rather, the machine is thinking that it popped open) is that the switch telling it whether the door is open or not doesn't trigger correctly. Open the machine, and you will see a black tab on the inside of the door standing out. That tab is what triggers the door open/close mechanism. The reason it's nor working correctly is that it is bent down too low. And the easiest way to fix that is by applying one or two layers of duct tape to the top of that tab. Cut two thin strips, put them on top while slightly bending the around the front, and then try again. In my case, it miraculously fixed the problem. This is a reason I would probably not buy this machine again, but knowing how easy it was to fix has made all the difference. I have also been very happy with the customer service.",3 people found this helpful,No

We only ever make cappuccino and the 'fire and forget' button is priceless. The froth is good albeit with slightly larger bubbles than from conventional froth. We always place the milk container in the fridge and so far we have had no problems with the seal. And, the milk container can be purchased separately at a reasonable price (so my wife says).One slight niggle we have had lately is that sometimes the door opens during the coffee making process. I have cleaned several times but to no avail. And it is difficult to find out what is pushing on the door from the inside (it is closed :-). But I guess we eventually will figure it out.Some reviewers have complained about the coffee being too cold. I currently live in Australia and previously lived 6 years in Italy where they serve the genuine cappuccino. Outside Italy I have often had the opposite problem, where inexperienced barista's make the coffee far too hot. It is not supposed to be that hot. In Italy the barista will generally attempt to remove your coffee cup almost immediately as the coffee is supposed to be consumed right away. A cappuccino can last a bit longer but is also consumed in short order. Some coffee gourmet sites list the optimal coffee temperature and too high a temperature ruins the coffee. So I am quite happy with the temperature of the Delonghi.",11 people found this helpful,No

I simply love the smell and ease that a machine like this brings to the morning. This morning I got the ""GENERAL ALARM"" death message. The manual states that the reason is that the inside is too dirty. I just cleaned the machine two days ago! There are no grinds anywhere! I even bought an air duster to clear any gunk that may have been accumulating where I couldn't see it. It's been taking longer and longer for the heating process in the past couple of weeks. I should've seen this coming.From what I've read across the internet, this ""GENERAL ALARM"" means that a part has gone bad. I've also discovered that the machine has a TON of little parts. I will be calling DeLonghi on Monday, and if they are useless (which is what I'm expecting), I'll call Amazon. I'll update this review. Clearly 5 months is not worth the price. If you asked me yesterday before it broke down, I would've rated it 4-stars based on the ease of use and not having to drive to a coffee place every morning. It loses a star for how inefficient it is at dumping the cakes (grinds get -everywhere- inside the machine).Don't be like me and say, ""Oh maybe I'll be one of the lucky ones where it won't break down in under 6 months."" There's a reason the majority of the reviews elsewhere state that you should expect such disappointment from DeLonghi.Update: The company that DeLonghi pays to do repairs in the US has had my machine for over 2 months now with no attempt to call and update me on the status. I called once and the women said, ""Do you have any idea how many machines we have?"" I won't go further but take that as you will. I'll never buy DeLonghi again.Update 7/26/11: I finally received the unit from the repair center DeLonghi uses. The unit now leaks water from the bottom when it is used. I called them and the only action they offered was to ""repair"" the unit again. They refuse to allow me to return the product, even though I haven't even owned it for more than a year.

Making me and my girlfriend a latte with 2 shots in each cup and frothing milk was very time consuming and messy. The Rancilio Rocky grinder spit grounds out side of the portafilter. Making espresso shots (4 for the 2 of us) required grinding coffee into the portafilter 4 times, and making the espresso, cleaning the portafilter and repeat these step 4 times.The De'longhi Perfecta experience:I was real nervous spending this much money on an automatic espresso machine and not knowing how well it will perform. First and more importantly, The taste of the espresso is excellent! In the manual it says to making at least 4-5 shots before the machine will produce satisfactory results. The grinder is preset perfectly but can be adjusted to your liking. I make double shots and it completes in 20secs which is perfect. The espresso is neither sour or bitter. It is the perfect balance in taste.I only make either a double shot espresso or a latte so i can only review the two. Ok so the espresso is delicious so now on to the latte. Some reviews Ive read stated the milk was too milky and no micro foam or doesn't produce much milk when making a latte. From the manual it shows 4 different ways to work the milk. READ THE DIRECTIONS. It will explain how to obtain denser froth or less dense froth. Pushing the Cappuccino button once will make a cappuccino and you can adjust the froth on the container as stated before. To make a latte, push the cappuccino button 'twice' and it will only make frothed milk. So for me, i make the double shot espresso then hit the cappuccino button twice, then i hit the cappuccino twice again and for me it makes my perfect latte.The machine itself has been described as loud but in my experience with other machines such as the Rancilio rocky and lelit espresso machine, the de'longhi perfecta is not any louder. The grinder is actually quieter than the Rancilio Rocky and reminds me of the sound the grinders in coffee shops sounds like. It sounds like quality and feels like a quality machine. Its extremely easy and quick to clean.In Summary:It produces quality espressos and quality lattes. It is a joy to use this machine!",4 people found this helpful,Yes

I also thought my wife would enjoy a one touch coffee experience. I was concerned about reviews that said it did not make hot enough drinks. I took a chance thinking that maybe those reviewers were comparing to 170-180 degree F drinks from Starbucks when you want to keep the temperature at 160 or below. I downloaded and read the manual to investigate what temperature I could expect a milk drink to be made, but there was no information other than that you could adjust the temperature of the espresso shot and to use cold milk for the frother. So I could keep my options open for returning the machine, I purchased from Costco online for $1200.This machine is really cool and a great piece of engineering. I like the interface and the overall appearance. It pulls a pretty good shot of espresso. It has an okay amount of creama an comes out at about 190 degrees on the hot setting. It looks a bit watery during the last 5 seconds of extraction, not creamy.The problem with this device is with the milk. You'll notice that there is a cappuccino button on the front. You make a latte by adjusting the amount of aeration with a little slide on the jug. This is how you make a latte according to the manual. It really only does cappuccinos. Either the milk has big bubbles or none at all. If that was the only problem with the milk, I would have kept the machine.Those who say the milk is not hot enough are correct. In order to get an acceptable latte or cappuccino you go from super automatic to almost as manual as pulling a shot from a portafilter and frothing your own milk. If you want warmer than luke warm you must 1) fill your cup with hot water. if you use the Perfecta, you'll have to use a different attachment where you connect the jug, 2) run water through the infuser right before you pull a shot, 3) run the cleaning cycle through the milk jug right before you froth milk. At this point you are ready to 4) hit the ""cappuccino"" button to get a 1:1 ratio of milk to espresso So I, 5) hit the ""cappuccino"" button two times quickly to get just the milk frothing for about a 2:1 milk to espresso ratio. Even with steps 1-3, your drink will be about 135 degrees, so if you don't plan to drink your cap within 5 minutes, you'll want to 6) put your drink in the microwave for 10-12 seconds.And there you have it, a super automatic cappuccino or latte with mediocre milk in 6 easy steps - not including filling the hopper with beans, the water tank, attaching the milk jug, emptying the spent espresso bin one or more of which you will have to do while making your cafe.I still like the machine, I just don't want to drink the coffee it produces. A couple of other things I DO like - 1) The water reservoir is in the front which is important given the height of this machine. 2) The drip tray is big enough to last through 14 drinks (after which you have to get inside the machine to get the discarded espresso before you do anything else).A couple of other complaints. 1) The plug is not grounded. Really, a $1200 appliance with machinery, electronics, heating elements and water without a grounded plug? 2)  The milk jug is a bit of a pain to attach and remove. 3) The DVD they included was formatted for European TVs.After returning it to Costco, I went with the Breville Barista Express BES860XL with grinder (available here at Amazon). It automatically grinds a pre-measured portafilter full of espresso (adjustable). You have to tamp it and hit the button to dispense 1 or 2 shots (the volume of which is also adjustable). You froth your own milk and get the texture and temperature you want. I got mine from Bed Bath and Beyond with the 20% off coupon for the same price as Amazon offers. I'll be giving it a 5 star review. It's no more trouble than the Perfecta but it's more fun and I get the results I want.",12 people found this helpful,No

But Time Will Tell?,"I spent a considerable time checking reviews on Super Automatic Espresso Machines.  They all seem to have issues. Agree or not, when I did a shortlist the ESAM 5500 came out in front. So when I got my annual rebate check from a Big Box retailer recently, I decided to buy this machine.  They had the best price on the ESAM 5500 at the time.  They also have a pretty solid, no questions asked return policy for duds.I received the Super Auto late on a Friday.  I spent some time setting it up and reading the manual (should be madatory reading).  Right out of the box the water spout wasn't seated correctly, so the machine would not function.  It took a few tries to set it right. After that hiccup, things went fine.  To head off potential seal problems, I put a drop of grapeseed oil on the O rings in the hot water feed.  I am also using distilled water to head off excessive scaling. The system for removing coffee grinds/pucks is wonky.  You need to open the door and then pull the tray out to access the discards.  This is just asking for problems in the long run.  I keep the machine on a timer.  So to my surprise when it either heats up or shuts off, it spits hot water.  It's fine if you want your drip tray soaked and splatter everywhere. I keep a cup under the spouts to catch the run off from the automatic rinsing.On to the coffee, I put in a container of Illy beans as per a recommendation in an on line review.  I heated my espresso cups with a kitchen hot water dispenser and off I went.  The Illy coffee was OK, but nothing special here.  On a whim, I picked up a Kilo of ""Faema Premium Espresso Beans"".  No plan, they were on sale. I dialed the grinder setting back 1 notch for a creamier cup and Voila, magic!!  I got the best cup of espresso I had ever had.  No exaggeration!!As for complaints about the temperature of cappucinos.  If you preheat the cup with hot water, the coffee will be very hot.  The cup warmer on the top is OK but does not give you a hot cups, merely warm.My kids love the automatic steamed milk.  They use it on their hot chocolate and it makes for happy kids.Yes the machine is made out of plastic. So I intend to be careful with the plastic doors.  Delonghi offers an extended warranty for not a lot of money.  The cost is less than one repair, so I am investing in that.  I live in a large urban area where Delonghi has a repair and deistribution centre so I hope to have reasonable service should I need it.",3 people found this helpful,No

I have settled on Illy beans and it is a real luxury to wake up, press one button, and have such a tasty treat.  It does not create true coffee-house foam but it is close enough.  Indeed, I am now accustomed to the slightly larger bubbles and find real cappuccino a bit too creamy.  In any case, the beast has worked like a charm so far.  It is expensive but life is short and little luxuries like this make it so much more enjoyable.  I also bought an aerolatte electric milk frother, which makes much thicker and more authentic foam for when I really want creamy foam.  But it is so easy to just pull the little milk frother that comes with this machine out of the fridge and press the button that I rarely use the aerolatte device, which is a shame because it was 90 bucks itself.  But as I said, life is short and little luxuries make it sweeter.  One issue is that it can be fussy to mate the milk jug with the machine: you gotta pull it off and push it back in sometimes to get the thing mated.  The nice thing about a true super automatic device such as the perfecta is that you are not tied to coffee pods:  it grinds whatever beans you give it.  All in all, I am glad I bought it and paid off the credit card bill accordingly.",4 people found this helpful,No

For the first 6 months it worked great, no issues, though it does require descaling quite frequently which is time consuming and can get expensive because of the special descaling liquid they recommend you to use.In February 2012 my frother stopped frothing.  I called customer service, and they diagnosed the problem as a worn-out o ring and potentially a problem with the milk tank lid.  Turns out both were at issue. It is now May 8th, and I'm still waiting for the milk tank lid.  I have put in countless calls to the customer service department but they cannot supply me with a new milk tank lid, they have no date when they think they will be getting them, they cannot locate one within the U.S., the so-called manager has no initiative whatsoever to extend my warranty seeing as how it's already been at least three months during which I don't have full capability of the machine.  I keep reminding customer service that I get better service at a discount retail store for a dollar item than I do for a $2,000 machine.Long story short, I will NEVER buy another Delonghi again.

Went with the Perfecta because of the double boiler (not on the 3200) and the auto-milk dispenser. First the good. It's much quieter than expected, which is great in the morning when others are asleep. I appreciate the custom settings, which allowed me to set the expected milk and espresso volumes my wife and I were used to (Starbucks grande sized). BTW, the machine also looks sharp. The unexpected drawback: it really takes until the 3rd cup in the morning for the milk to get up to a truly acceptable temperature (confirmed with a thermometer). Cup #1 in the morning in a lukewarm latte, and this is despite setting the machine temp to ""hi"". Latte #3 will hit 160 degrees, which is great. This almost caused us to return the machine (there's no option on this machine to manual froth to a desired temp), but I think we'll work with it and see how it goes.",3 people found this helpful,No

I just received mine yesterday.  I bought it from another vender, but since I typically do most of my shopping via Amazon I thought I would share my experience thus far.  Overall, this Super-Automatic is simple to use and makes great coffee, lattes, and cappuccino's.  My advice though....WATCH THE DVD BEFORE USING!!!  I thought I had this thing in the bag.. how difficult could it be to use??....Well it isn't difficult to use, but there are a few things I did that had I watched the video all the way through I would not have done.  For example, when setting how fine or coarse you want the beans you have to adjust the dial one notch at a time while the grinder is running (still doesn't make sense to me).  I paused the video before waiting for the lady to finish talking on the topic and just moved it a few notches towards fine...oops!  Oh well,  doesn't seem to have adversely effected anything, but now I know.  Contrary to reviews I have read of super-auto's, the burr grinder on this one is quiet when running.  On a scale of 1-10 where 10 is extremely loud and 1 is basically silent I would rate this machine a 5 and my Cuisinart Grind and brew (the one that hold like a pound of beans) an 8.  I was actually expecting something much louder.Build Quality-  I would have to say I am impressed with the looks of this machine and its fit and finish.  I am sure some people will complain of the amount of plastic, but seeing how this thing already weighs over 20lbs.  why add more weight.  I thought about the Gran Dama, but honestly this machine is better.Coffee- I was also considering the Jura Z5 because I read good things, but the price was a stretch.  Granted, this machine isn't cheap either.  I believe that I made the right choice.  The espresso is great.  I do wonder though what it tasted like from the factory, but since I changed the settings prematurely I will never know...ha!  The Milk pitcher is ingenious...BRAVO!  Latte's and Cappuccino's are a breeze and let me tell you this machine makes both very well.  Sure a semi-auto can do better, but really I do not want to do the extra steps.  As it is, Starbucks does not compare.  I have read reviews that state the Gran Dama latte's can be cold.  I have to admit, the first one I made was, but after I made a couple and utilized the cup warmer they were perfect.  I bought the Cinnamon Dolce syrup from Starbucks and I downed to many lattes....probably explains why at 0209 EST I am still up and writing this review.My Opinion-  If you are in the market for a super-automatic I would say give this one a consideration.  I bought this machine from a place that has probably the best return policy of all retailers, so if something does go wrong I will take it right back for another.  Regardless, the people at Delonghi are great and I was amazed that as soon as I pushed (1) I was talking to a person almost immediately.  I will probably just purchase the extended warranty from the manufacturer and extend the 2 years to 4...Extra $150.  That is all for now.  Look for an update in a couple months.**UPDATE** 3/24/10Well I overworked the first one, but the place I bought it from gladly took it back and ordered me another one.  I made nearly 2,000 cups of coffee in 4 months with the first one.  I have made nearly 1000 with the one I have now, but it seems to be holding up fine.  As far as recommending it I still would.  I love this machine.  It is so nice that I can make everything Starbucks does without having to pay them $4 for every cup.  I have basically every syrup they have and all my guests rave about the Delonghi.  It is a lot of money to spend on a coffee maker, but I would do it again.**UPDATE** 8/14/12Well my Perfecta has been perfecta to date.  No real issues to report yet.**UPDATE** 1/2/2014Still going strong!  See the comment section for my current count.  I had thought about getting a Saeco Xelsis, but this machine is great.  I intend to stay loyal to DeLonghi. This year I was able to buy the pumpkin sauce from Starbucks..SCORE!  Since purchasing this machine I have saved around $12k in coffee cost (cost of machine included), so recommending it is a no-brainer.  Like every product out there you will have lemons, but I am confident there are more machines that have functioned as mine has.**FINAL UPDATE** 1/15/2015On 1/10/15 after 6342 coffee's and 4131 cappuccino's my Delonghi Perfecta sprung a leak.  After further inspection I found that the generator inside needed replaced.  I watched a youtube video on how to replace the generator, but ultimately decided it was time to retire my Perfecta.  I considered sticking with Delonghi, but ultimately purchased the Breville Oracle (which I received via FedEx today).  I will post my review of the Oracle in a few weeks.",45 people found this helpful,No

My understanding is that although the metallic blue costs a bit more, the two machines are the same. (This was a birthday present from my wife, but I did help to pick it out.)After pouring over all of the reviews on espresso machines, my wife and I settled on and originally tried to order the 3500 Magnifica, but found that the vendors (we tried two) were unable to fulfill the order saying it was no longer available or they could get it but could not guarantee when it would arrive... So we decided instead to try to order the 5500, and - luckily - had no problem receiving it. Shipment was timely and the packaging was good and solid. Nothing broken, nothing missing.So...how well does it work? First, set up was a breeze. Within 20 minutes, this machine was up and running. The manual recommends making a few tossers to break in the machine, which we did. After that it was a matter of playing with the settings and finding the ideal cup of espresso based on taste.Bottom line, I am very pleased with the results. The cups I've made to date (we've had the machine for about 3 weeks now) have been consistently good. We use the Lavazza beans, and we get good crema in the cups every time. Delicious.Some of the reviews mention that the coffee isn't hot enough...personally, I think it's fine. I wouldn't want my espresso scalding hot. The default setting is medium...if you need it warmer, just move the setting to high. If you need it higher than that, perhaps you're planning on suing the company by spilling some on your lap while driving? If not, you can always heat it in the microwave.The automation in this machine is impressive. It grinds your beans, heats the water and delivers a cup of espresso (or coffee) depending on the settings you make in a matter of seconds. You can set it for water hardness, temperature, size and strength of the coffee, grind settings, auto-on or off if you like...you can also use pre-ground coffee if you prefer (one cup at a time). This machine also comes with a complementary pack of descaler with clear instructions on how to perform the operation.Clean up is a breeze. The instruction manual is comprehensive and clear. If you READ IT you shouldn't have any problems.We haven't had the machine long enough to comment on any maintenance issues, so I may have to add to this sometime in the future depending on how things go. But so far so good.Thanks to my wife for my birthday present. I couldn't be happier.**UPDATE 22 Oct 2013Just did the first descaling and everything went fine. The machine is still operating perfectly with no maintenance issues or problems whatsoever. We do not use milk or cream here, so I cannot comment on the frothing since I've never used it. I've found that the Italian Espresso beans (sold here on Amazon 

Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Espresso, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag

  ) work well and taste great. If you like espresso you'll enjoy this machine and the convenience it offers. It holds up to heavy daily use (so far), and it's incredibly easy to operate.",2 people found this helpful,No

I take coffee with me to work every day in a travel cup and by the time I get to work (15 minutes) I have to heat it in the microwave because it is cold.
