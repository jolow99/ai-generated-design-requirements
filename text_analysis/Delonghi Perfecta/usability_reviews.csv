0,"It makes great coffee. I have no complaints about that. Taste is relative, so I can understand how some may like it less than others, but I have no complaints about the coffee. The frothed milk is perfect, the coffee tastes just like it should. We use it every day, and we all but stopped buying any coffee from espresso stands.I updated this review to 3 stars in fairness for just how much we actually enjoy using this unit. However, I'll leave the terrible experience we had with the customer support below for reference.I think there should be more to a great product that it's nominal performance. Quality is also defined by reliability and customer service. DeLonghi boasts striving for excellence, but they fail miserably.My machine arrived in intact condition. Worked great out of the box. However, after less than six weeks of use the grinder failed. It started suddenly making this terrible rattling noise and stopped actually grinding the coffee. First, I shot them an e-mail to ask if there's a quick fix. They replied 10 days later asking for information to process a service request. I sent them the invoice, serial numbers and all they asked for and they never replied back. After a week or so, we called the support line and they eventually sent us a box and a shipping label - it arrived after other 10 days. We shipped the machine. Here's where it gets interesting. 4 weeks passed without any update so we contacted them again. There was some lame excuse about them moving their service center from one location to another and after further questioning they admitted they have no idea where our machine was. It's been several weeks and they still ""cannot find it"". They... lost it.UPDATE: After several more calls, they eventually found it and shipped it to us, this time, lo and behold, priority. Still, it took about 60 days from when it broke down until we were able to use it again.Caveat emptor! Consider this very seriously. If your product works and keeps working you'll be fine. But know that if it breaks, there will be no easy help available and you'll waste lots of time and you'll gain lost of aggravation to get it fixed.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.27382156252861023, 0.24471688270568848, 0.24454262852668762, 0.2369188666343689]"
1,We have had the unit approximately 18 months + - no issues works great. Warnings come up for descaling based on number of dispensing made but descaling is easy. We dont always use the milk accessory but have never had a problem when we do use. Warning comes up for low water and also to empty grinds collection bin after so many uses. If you empty it early you will still get the warning.Overall it been great and has definitely paid for itself vs buying coffees out. Add water and beans and keeps on working.,"['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.47104907035827637, 0.4460258185863495, 0.04417891427874565, 0.03874615207314491]"
2,"Seller provide outstanding support for missing parts and instructions for optimal heat & coffee cream as well as use water sensors built within the pitcher. Overall even if the product is refurb pls expect the working is still up to par. I would say that with the Sellers guidance this Delonghi ESAM5500B Perfecta “refurb” espresso machine went head to head with my $5,000 Jura Giga3.No regrets, best investment ever made. Thank you Sandy for all your effort in resolving my espresso machine issues.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.4558528661727905, 0.4458262324333191, 0.05804876610636711, 0.04027211293578148]"
3,I love this machine it is well worth the money.  It is very easy to use and I get coffee that is like the coffee shop.  This machine does both ground and beans.  With the ground coffee you add it when you make it.  With the beans their is a place to fill it up and you can use it over and over.  The frothing milk is wonderful.  I would buy this again.,"['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.679017186164856, 0.2949952185153961, 0.013309746980667114, 0.012677876278758049]"

The customer service was exquisite and prompt.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.6301376819610596, 0.3003275692462921, 0.037691082805395126, 0.03184359520673752]"

6,Our second Delonghi and we love it as much as the first. Extremely easy to use and cleanup is simple. The wife and kids absolutely love the ease of the cappuccino maker and I like the detachable milk container that makes that possible! My only request would be the ability to change a strength or size setting after the start button is pushed. With the older model rotary dials that was possible. With the electronic it is not. It just means I have to pay more attention when getting my cup after someone else has gotten theirs.,"['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.5506113767623901, 0.29551050066947937, 0.10102548450231552, 0.052852630615234375]"

8,"I own 2 Delonghi super automatics this one being our most recent. I've had it for 2.5 years with zero issues. I make 6 or more espresso drinks per day on our house sometimes more. This machine works hard. Two weeks ago the grinder broke or jammed don't know. I contacted Delonghi service who sent a white gloves padded shipping box and label right away. I mailed it FedEx to The Dallas service center unsure when I'd ever see it again.Today I was shocked to get a call from the delivery guy that my beloved espresso machine was left on my porch. Everything works great, problem solved. I am so impressed. I know super automatics can be finicky and I've heard horror stories. Thankfully I didn't have to experience one. Thank you Delonghi!Otherwise for those looking we love this machine. Espressos and tall coffees are at the ready. Milk drinks, lattes and cappuccinos are perfect. The milk container works great and froths every time. Just don't leav milk in it. It must not be air tight and it gets funky quick even in the fridge.I would this machine again twice over. I love it. I can't believe I survived two weeks without it.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.6181460022926331, 0.21822652220726013, 0.09074633568525314, 0.07288110256195068]"
