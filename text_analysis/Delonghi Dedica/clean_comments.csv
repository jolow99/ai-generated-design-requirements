the right tool however the machine doe not take any coffee i need to use le coffee than the right measure to take a coffee doe this happen to you guy any suggestion of what is happening thank you,if there is no coffee coming out it is possible that your coffee is ground too fine also make sure you use the correct portafilter there is 3 with the dedica 2 of them is for ground coffee 1 is for esa filter i do not use that but the with the other 2 the large one take 14 gram of coffee the single shot take 7grams hope this help then once you get into coffee you can buy an after market portafilter like in this video and play around with dosing grind etc,how could you make 38g of liquid in 30 second like that my dedica give 70g of liquid any setting need to be done,so it can pull decent and tasty shot at stock which coffee type brand do you find work the best with this machine,excellent my friend keep up the great work would love to know the original sound track used here very calming,it is cool but usually le is more is this something you really do everyday,curious why you would use your e685m when you have a lmm there,cuanta gilipolleces para tomar un caf,hi i have a question every one of my coffee is terribly sour every type of coffee is sour i tried change the temperature pressure and non pressure sieve different type of water i decalcified the coffee machine with the original preparation and also with vinegar i do not know where the mistake may be anymore can you please help me i am already desperate i own a delonghi dedica ec685 m coffee machine and a delonghi grinder kg521 m,have you tried different bean,you have the single shot button programmed a a double have you tried bottomless portafilter for the dedica and have you noticed the pump is not strong enough to get water through too finely ground bean on my breville grinder i have to do it about a 13 14 because if i go below an 11 the pump can not get any water through lol,this is the mo artly commercial i ever saw damn,5 min to make a coffee it a joke,why are you using a delonghi while standing next to a la marzocco,wait you have a marzocco and use a de longhi to make coffee,this is so satisfying,,,what is this soundtrack,como diria o saudoso casimiro mermao se esse maluco faz isso todo dia pra tomar um caf eu sou um chamyto,the temping is really uneven the way you do it,nice i love ur stye vinyl and coffee is also my mood i even bought vinyl player to match it up while taking a sip of my coffee,could you please share what song is playing in this video neither shazam nor audiotag recognize it edit found it here is the info for anyone else wanting to track it down song fascination performed by japanese mandolinist masao koga at first i thought it wa guitarist antonio koga album screen mood koga guitar romantica 1965 compilation of film music arranged by makoto saeki song originally written by fermo dante marchetti in 1905 record label nippon columbia jps 5024,i am learning i love coffe,hey im totally new into this with my delonghi 685 i just bought lavazza coffe bean caffe crema grinded it and put it into my portafilter i noticed that it very fluid and not really creamy what im doing wrong is this crema only given by using espresso bean,you might need to a grind finer b get a fresher bag of bean from the coffee store instead of supermarket,a question how did you change that steamer i bought a new one but the steamer is different,yes he changed it it is the rancilio silvia steamwand it is definetly a really good upgrade,life s to short for bad coffee,this wa a whole vibe dude your video are amazing keep up the great work,do u use the standard filter or other,imagine being that slow,the steam wand is not the original one i suspect where did you get this upgraded one,hey there what song is this,un video molto rilassante sento il profumo di caff,oh mate speed up life is too short,nice video 18g coffee in one shot usually in youtube coffee master take 14g per double shot what filter basket do you use i can not see it in equipment list,nico hey i also have a dedica and i am not able to fill it with nearly 16g of fine grain or the liquid just doe not pass through what is your way of doing it in consequence,nico fair i have a magica with 58mm portafilter thus i go with 18g but i would rather lower the dose and keep the ratio than change the ratio unless you prefer a different ratio then go for it,patbm2811 not for a 52 mm basket if i grind for a ratio around 2 1 and put 18 gramm in my dedica usually suffocates,18g for a double shot is actually pretty standard most will range between 17 20g 14g is a rather small double shot especially if you consider the normal 2 1 ratio he ha a quite short ratio with 18g in and 28g out making it a mix between espresso and ristretto go for a 18g in 36 40g out for your double shot if you want to be somewhat safe or even better experiment a long a you got exactly what you like best but always enjoy,cool but why do you need the scale after putting the coffee in the espresso machine i understand that you need to measure how much you put in the machine but after that i do not get it is use,he wanted to measure the amount of brewed coffee usually ppl is looking for 1 2 ratio so 18g ground coffee and try to get 36g of brewed coffee in this case he got about 30g so about 1 1 7 ratio,i looooove the little scale what s the brand it doesnt look like classic kitchen scale,you have a good set up however what you did is a ristretto am i right 18 2g of grind to 30 1g of liquid resulting to a 1 1 6 ratio thank you,pretty much thought the same thing,did you change the nozzle of milk frother,yes he did,i love the classic brazilian music perfect with coffee,great video just out of curiosity why do you still have a dedica when you also have a la marzocco a linea mini from the look of it any reason for keeping both,igor versiani i use linea for small pitcher a well and i get perfect result,my guess dedica warms up much quicker and linea mini is steam pressure is too much for such a small pitcher,hi how do i change the wand to a more progressional one without the bulky tip,you can get a rancilio silva steaming wand which you can put into this machine it is a bit of a pain though,i m interested too,link to get your steamer wand please hate cleaning the stock wand,i think it is the rancillio after market but a link would be nice,hello i got a question do you turn the steamer to cappuccino or hot milk option for doing latte art i tried the way you did a couple of time but failed to do art on the surface of the espresso however i made a single espresso how many gram of milk do i need or how many second shall i steam the milk shall it be foamy or intense could you please help me,hey ive been having problem a well i would definitely use the hot milk option for latte art with the cappucino option your foam will get to stiff and dry in my experience,i believe he is replaced the stock steamer with the rancilio silvia steam wand,i do so,remove the cover from the wand just leave the black rubber part it should help with foaming,he ha a upgraded machine his steamer is not to compare with the one included to the machine the one wich is included there is not much of a difference between the two option but anyway try to angle the steamer and just let it dip into the milk not to deep try to create a little vortex without putting to much air into it silky and smooth it should be not foamy and stiff xd,which coffee bean do you use any recommendation for good coffee bean,for espresso it best to use coffee between 2 6 week after roasting,buy directly from the coffee roaster or a specialty cafe or from a online coffee store for an easier brew using espresso machine use medium dark to dark roasted coffee bean preferably a blend specifically made for espresso,gaya mutu keunggulan,hey arty i am using ec680 and my espresso always so watery what could be the problem,gavin chrisaputra late reply but the finer the grind the more pressure it need to get through the coffee thus having a longer extraction time try to shoot for 25 second on average with a ratio from 1 to 2 5 for espresso so 18g of grinded bean to 45g of espresso,seyed ahh okay thanks for the info bro,make sure that the bean are grinded right,how many ml of milk,arty home thanks a lot,160 ml,what is the song name,arty home thank you,song fascination f d marchetti album screen mood koga guitar romantic arr m saeki,hmm relaxing what is that basket you are usung mine is a lot smaller,04 20,18 2 g is to mach,i use a non pressurized portafilter with that you can get a perfect sharp and creamy espresso,instablaster,whats the title of the song bro,what is model of weighing scale,2021 ver i guess,timeore,what pitcher size are you using,how big is your portafilter,hey great video i got the same machine with the original frother my milk is sometimes too bubbly any tip,replace the steamer wand with a different one,do you time the extraction by yourself because the machine ha pre set extraction time in it,you can customize the extraction time but holding down either button for a long a you want,what temperature configuration do you use saludos de chile,i use middle,someone said time counter should be started at 1st drip however someone said time counter should be started when pressing the ec685 coffee button i would like to know which one is correct many thanks,just ha to be a reference,i think it work for both which method do you like use that method,hey i could need some advice i am using the delonghi with a bottomless portafilter but i always get espresso that taste a bit sour i only have a graef cm 702 grinder but at the finest setting even with really light tamp the machine can not press enough water through the coffee when adjusting the grind i got a seemingly perfect shot 17g in 25g out in 27 no channeling but i still have some sourness i used two different type of coffee so i do not think that the coffee is a problem also the two were quite dark roast do you have anny tipps advice i would highly appreciate it thanks,it can also be a temperature issue unless you have temperature control try to preheat the system a much a possible,you try to increase the amount of ground coffee more,great work your video are very relaxing could you write the soundtrack playlist in the description thanks,yes the soundtrack please,arty home yes can you please add the soundtrack music in the description a i can not find any so lovely to listen it while you make and drink your beautiful coffee xx,thank you,hi where i can buy the little metal cup where you put the grinded coffee and later put in the the filter,from ebay you search stainless steel 2oz cup,nice i see your ec685 have other cappuccinatore than my can you confirm thx,i have a problem with my delonghi in which the espresso doe not pour out beautifully but rather in drip doe anybody know how to fix,it flow slowly or quickly grind the coffee bean too finely or too rough,very very veryyyyy cool,great jobd man,i have the same machine it doe not make the foam properly i followed many tip and video but it never bring the foamy milk like the one you got i am not sure if you used the same foam you got fr the dedica,hi could you share your setup i use the same dedica with normal portafilter and 2 cup basket but no chance to put 18gramms of grind coffe into it and somehow single shot time is only 15 17 but somehow i get more than 70grams of extract so ratio is more than 4 i watched many video but could not figure out what is the problem any idea thx in advance and sorry know i am newbie,got a 51mm non pressurized filter basket on amazon took out the black plastic part it fit perfectly i can live with the screw third hole for better coffee good coffee bean fine grind size even distribution and tamp your espresso will be perfecto,i have had the same problem with you with the default portafilter coming with delonghi dedica coffee machine the maximum capacity this portafilter get is about 14gr of not so finely ground coffee in the 2 cup basket i have tried with finer grind and wa able to put in 18gr of coffee but the result wa not being able to extract proper espresso shot only after changing to non pressurized portafilter i have managed to extract proper espresso shot with really fine ground coffee here arty home ha modified the default portafilter to fit the non pressurised basket i believe a non pressurized basket the one with multiple instead of one whole in conjunction with finely ground coffee is your solution,i think a good grinder and fine grinding will help you,filip cicmansky thx what did you bought sell this and buy an other one still an option a i drink just espresso and cappuccino,most likely your grinder isnt fine enought i had the same problem u til i invested into proper espresso grinder around gbp200 i would auggest going to a coffee shop and asking them to grind you a dose and trying to extract it with your portafilter at home,loving your video and i appreciate your workflow mine for my dedica is similar but i do not have a nice of a grinder so i usually do the water spritz trick when i load my single dose into the hopper because i get slightly worse static you took the plastic insert out of your portafilter right how did you prevent the drip from the middle hole and still fit the basket in,i cut off the top of the plastic you can watch the video,u are using stock portafilter with a dfferent busket may u explain more on your setup thanks,i want you to watch video on my channel then you will understand more,why using dedica when you havd lamarzocco quicker warm up time,arty home,yes because it warm up faster,why you always drink cafe latte,arty home what about espresso,i like making latte art and drinking it,,arty home,2 cup 16 20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2,da come esce il caff deve essere una schifezza schiuma bianca,worst espresso ever seen,hello i have a delonghi d dica ec685 for a couple of month now however i am always in trouble to take a coffee right if fill the compartment with grounded coffee using the right measure that is available with the machine then a press the coffee just a bit with the right tool however the machine doe not take any coffee i need to use le coffee than the right measure to take a coffee doe this happen to you guy any suggestion of what is happening thank you,v v not yet i think it is exactly the opposite the coffee is not grinded enough i will try other coffee,hey i too am facing the same problem have u found a solution,happy to see good coffee next time,,what kind of cofee wa that omg,nice video and unboxing but you need to learn to properly make an expresso not adequate coffee with hole inside it is not the pressure you just have to pressure it evenly,thanks for the tip,not good,i must admit you really did not make this machine seem any good i have this machine and i am no barista but it actually is a good machine having said that when i first used it it did seem a bit crap now after learning it and some of it feature it make a great coffee i am quite lazy though and i use the ese pod save time and mess,banan muhammad you can take off the metal tube and just use the silicon one if you want to have complete control on how much steam you put in though you do need a little experience,banan muhammad i made 1 perfect steamed milk from this machine i started with push down the tube to cappuccino first for fist 5 sec of steaming process then push up to hot milk mode for the rest until you get temp that you want during the process of steaming have to tilt a jug a bit and let is the milk moving in circle you gon na get perfect milk for latte art,my steam tube is not working so well sometimes it is stopping just even 5 sec anyone have problem with it,can you have control of how to texturize the milk like not making it too foamy to have latte texture not cappuccino,how many mililiters should i get for 1 cup,steam cappuccino mode it work for like 4 5 second then it go off and then the single and the double coffee button blink on the machine it is a new machine what am i doing wrong here,dinesh nadar i have problem with steam mode too can you tell me how to solve it,surprise unboxing club ok so i wa not pushing the steam switch properly to the extreme right the reason it get stopped now sorted thank you for your reply,hi when the steam cappuccino mode is lightened press it then you can use the steam switch on the right side of the machine to get hot milk or foam when you release the switch all 3 button are lighting up again then you have to press the stram cappuccino mode again if you want to use it again but there is no time limit to use the steam cappuccino mode 4 5 second is definitely too le then i guess there is something wrong with it,1percent coffee 99percent milk,hehe exactly a lady coffee,solo le per la grandezza delle bolle che hai nella crema di latte dovresti vergognarti d,what is tamper diameter,51mm,,i made a creamy espresso using delonghi dedica with a non pressurized portafilter,artem yavorskyi eureka mignon is the grinder which i use it is good and compatible with many type of coffee machine,coffee nomad what grinder do you use,daniel 12345 i think i shall try it,i also use the dedica non pressurised with the sage dose control pro grinder the coffee is incredible,all what we need is a grinder and the perfect coffee bean,estas chavo,which is better this one or the ecp 35 31,very very light coffee did u drink that,hi it wa the first one i ever made i am still using this coffee machine daily but now i got some more experience with the right coffee bean it really taste not bad,my machine is having a problem making foam,i am having the same problem sometimes try to clean the milk frother this help me,with this piece of junk,thx for this video i needed,thank you luis happy to hear that,is this full stainless steel cause on other color like red or black seems plastic,lena t i got the stainless steel one it is all metal very high quality exceeded my expectation good machine but the milk frothing is a joke,it is partly plastic i think,also consider the new german wmf espresso lumero model also in even better quality own brand stainless steel it look very similar but more square in design anyone know if dl ha licenced it production to wmf a specification i think are exactly the same,that is not a good cup of coffee,gordan babi and it pressurised i non pressurised mine because the coffee tasted artificial with the stock pressurised basket,the goat pear it is underextracted 16 second it should be around 25 watery and no crema you can make way better cup of coffee with this machine but it required knowledge,why,like a barista mi cojones jajajajajajajajs,the coffee is not espresso soft grind it likely for brewed coffee thats why the extraction is not well enough nice unboxing vid and machine,thanks mohammed for the info that wa my first ever made coffee and with this machine i did not know when i unboxed it now i know,good machine bad barista,the shot is terrible ill probably look for another brand,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,my office have this one thats why i need to learn how to make it,good to hear hope this video help a bit with it,i have demo a video on how to make latte art,thanks,you are welcome glad to hear,crap demo,barista lol your coffee is watery tamping is bad and the overall finished drink look quite poor,v b forgetting a single letter ha nothing to do with spelling the title is misleading and the tutorial suck judging by the like dislike i am not the only one sorry for triggering you lol,first of all learn to spell and second of all stop hating people on the internet just because they are trying to help others out do not get me wrong i am very sorry that an internet tutorial channel did not meet your high standard,thats bad barista very light coffee,that tamping wa not great you could see the hole in the top of the puck the water would have channelled through this is why the shot wa so light in colour nice video though,pressurized basket do not need 30lb tamping like nonpressurized so i think the problem wa what the other viewer mentioned,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,it is good i like it,i have this model for it size it pack a punch pull great coffee even though the basket is pressurized,pretty good machine but my wife struggled with it definitely a learning curve for people who do not really have that passion for coffee,a great review i have enjoyed my delonghi i like it compact size it delivers good constant quality result,hello hope you can help me or someone can help me we are a home of 3 people that enjoy coffe some espresso some capuchino and some latte we are confused with what machine should we buy our option are this one the ec860 and de delonghi ec685m deluxe all your help will be appreiate it,shame about the steam wand people change for the recilio,i get far better result than that with the 40 pc robusta bean i have i get 2 third crema and a dark brown and red crema with most other bean i can not i have replaced the sieve with a normal one have used it for 3 year 3 time a day i grind my own coffee but it can also be used with senso or ese pad forgot to say ready in just a few minute not 20 like the stupidly expensive machine of my friend that get rubbish result,expected to see how the machine work got exactly that and a good laugh great job,why is it so difficult to move the filter holder from insert to close on the delonghi dedica,really like your way of presentation,what is it any diffirrent with ec785 gy recommand me pls for ec785 gy review video thanks,thanks for this review honestly the best video i watched smooth and clear explanation you go direct to the point,i wa curious if it is possible that james dedica wa set to a lower temperature setting since when i got myself a dedica it seems to be running really hot to the point where i ended up lowering the temperature setting it come with out of the box or perhaps it could be an issue with either the machine i got or the one he had,that woman is hilarious and amazing at the same time,good presentation but it is the worst espresso machine i have ever owned a machine i would owned fro 24 year finally gave up the ghost and at my age there is no point buying something expensive that will outlive me the dedica came highly recommended so much for that sorry it is a bad coffee maker if you are drawing 8 10 cappuccino a day,i find that the pump on this machine is very weak,hi i hv just decided to buy this machine because of your very nice review gail tks for sharing,thanks for the video very instructive,thanks for the demo got this machine it will be perfect for the apartment,coffee should not get in contact with aluminium and hot should not get in contact with plastic all this is ruining your health and influence immensely the taste of the coffee better to choose something more expensive with stainless steel upgrade top class professional gear doe not utilise aluminium nor plastic that may come in touch with coffee so let choose semiprofessional home appliences that take that philisophy after the best,sold,uhhh plastic in the portafilter and the steam wand can be very bad for your health never drink hot liquid that passed through hot liquid,miss you seriously made me laugh hahahhaha amazing video thanks a lot,hello

model but i have an essential question maybe someone can help me which is the most suitable and affordable grinder for this machine d,love how she presented it,witch grind to you use,i have this coffee machine it really for newbie who want to have imitation of decent espresso or latte cappuccino you gon na ask why so portafilter with this little hole in it it not producing crema a it should be it just a trick crema disappears quickly a it not created by water steam pressure going through coffee but through this tiny hole in portafilter the steam wand doe not allow to produce decent steamed milk with correct texture it also created for people who do not have experience technique to foam milk so it extremely hard to do any latte art tamper also ha to be replaced summarizing if you want this machine because of the design it really nice though to make your espresso better you have to buy naked portafilter it not so pricy on aliexpress good grinder that allows to grind finer than those market grinder for 40dollar or you can disassemble it change grinding to finder and usable again it not perfect solution a those grinder produce a lot of coffee dust which make coffee more sour there is not much you can do about the steam wand if you do not want to loose warranty i would recommend to replace it with classic one in general if you want just design and so called espresso it ok,airplane you so crazy,that first line got me a,this lady is so great,i sick look at her better sleep at home,this woman is the best,are you going to do a review on the de longhi distinta coffee machine i quite fancy the dedica deluxe at this stage,lady is great funny and nice presentation,i removed the plastic and sawed off the bottom to make a bottomless portafilter trust me the espresso get between the plastic and the metal and when you unscrew that is portion to remove the plastic you will be very glad that you removed the plastic,can you make an americano using this machine,is the plastic inside the basket safe for long term use i believe the plastic metls over a period and cause all kind of health issue including cancer an deformity is it removable,can someone help me is it worth the money is their a better machine in the same price range do you recomend buying it,delonghi make nice tamper for this at least it is sold in europe,just discovered this channel this lady is amazing your character expertise and clarity are refreshingly rare never stop,same here,great review from a tell it like it is likeable believable person thanks want to comment that i just bought the dedica ec680 which is compared with this newer ec685 it is indicated that there are two major difference but i have only found one major one and one minor one yes the steam nozzle on the newer one ha two setting which is the major change but the drip tray on both model actually come apart not just the ec685 so you can use taller glass in both i call it a minor change however because there is no metallic removable secondary drip tray in the ec680 when you take the drip tray unit apart but if you do not want need flat hot milk then buying the ec680 is a much better deal a the unit are otherwise indistinguishable in how they function and a deal breaker for some inability to use a taller glass is actually possible in the older machine,gale you are amazing thank you dear for this great presentation,best ever video,great job could listen all day thanks,hello i still have the pressurized basket and i use the graef grinder do you have any idea why i get bitter and burnt coffee,could be your grinder i have seen other folk complain about this when you are grinder is burr get too hot then it mess up the bean it give them a sour burnt taste,is this the ec685 w thank you dedica,good job,plastic on the hottest spot not ideal,just for fun you know,love the way you talk greeting from egypt,you did not froth the milk properly you did not taste the espresso shot to see if they are extracted properly and you do not know how to pour milk all your video are like that i like to see review from true barista is,i bought it and have no regret i am saving more money here in the long run than buying coffee in cafe since it is lockdown i have great craving for coffee that this machine have met,zanke tanti,i do not even need to buy an espresso machine i am watching this video for gail,although it make nice coffee and milk it ha few problem if you have to make 2 capputsino then you have to make the first one then turn the machine off and then turn it on and make the 2nd one mine broke down within a year delonghi took it back and repaired it they didnt replace it with new yesterday it broke down again i am very happy about the quality of coffee it make especially if you know how to use it but very unhappy it broke twice,hello just bought my coffee machine coffee grinder and now i have to both set the coffee grinder and the espresso shot i have been reviewing your and some other video in regard to this topic separately but never at the same time a both set ups are interconnected how should i proceed if i set the coffee machine without coffee in it to a specific amount of espresso shot when i add my bean it might be le due to water absorbance then for setting up my grinding i need to control the flow for x milliliter of final coffee in the cup so how would you recommend me to set everything up thank you,that airplane part wa beautifully random lol,ok it look like she is too kind to tell that this machine is rubbish,a lovely video thanks i got given one of these new i find the coffee it doe is insipid,is the grinder included with the coffee machine thanx,no you have to purchase one and my advice for grinder you have to get a better one it is really effect the taste of espresso shot,why it produce so poor crema,maybe it is not a fresh bean and she use a pressurized basket i am using this machine with naked portafilter and non pressurized basket it is give me a good result,in the video the machine sounded very quiet is that how you would describe it thanks for any information,hmmm i ordered one of amazon uk and it arrived today and the milk thingy doe not work looking at it the pump doe not run when i turn the steam thingy question the long rubber bit under the metal that you removed is that required for it to work it

coffee gear and you i love your presentation,one thing aobut these machine is that the steamer always spit out water and this water mix with your milk i would say it add about 10 to 15 percent water to your milk also i owned 2 of the same non deluxe version they each worked for six month and then they just did not wife is very upset,4 21 plenty of dirt cheap tamper available in 51mm both on ebay

coffee shop in my little town and i do not have a money for fancy big batista machine in the beginning i wonder if i can start my work with this machine use it for a while and then get a better one,is the porta aluminum metal safe for food purpose because sometimes people tend to remove the plastic part and using non pressurize basket so the coffee get direct contact with the metal,if someone ha knowledge about this please share with u,i do not drink coffee my family doe so i can make it for the however the main reason i am looking at this machine is that when i used to make coffee for a living i also used to make really awesome hot chocolate with the frothy steamed milk and this machine is nice and thin which is great in my limited space it more importantly look to make great frothy milk and only heat required amount of water needed for single use at a time i could also make a cuppa tea with it which is awesome given it is my main drink,instant thumb up for this lady plane humour,coffee is acidic that is why it is not a good idea to have hot coffee pouring into plastic and then into your stomach,gail is review change how i think about thing,what is the size of the filter holder,the airplane bit is so goofy love it,i wan na be her friend,coffee newbe here doe making coffee out of these taste good like a starbucks latte,with a decent grinder and good bean it will taste way better than anything you can get at starbucks,is this product also called dedica style ec685 w,just bought the machine the frothing is a bit disappointimg but maybe i am not doing it right,w is a white wersion of the same coffee maker,love you gail,i just ordered mine i am so excited i can not contain myself,stealtho peep who care that you do not care,bruh who care,napz999 i have had mine for a year and it is still going i like it,it ha been 6 month since u ordered how is it are you still happy that you ordered or it wa le than what you expected im about to get one tomorrow i hope you will respond soon or any one else who had this machine thank you,how do you like it,we call that suicide of cappucino,a little bit of something something nothing i died lol,hey gail love your review how about do a few combination coffee espresso machine review,dang she is expert,you are a cool person,i bought a new ec685 in january 2019 i had one older that i bought 3 year ago but the pump gave up 3 year wa ok a i usually make 7 double shot a day i think the best advantage with my new one not shown in this video are the coffee filter now made up of 2 part the perforated filter that can be removed from the part with the one small hole for pressurizing this make it easier to check clogging in the perforated filter and the other part just hold up the part to a light window and you will observe any clogging use a needle a described in the manual to avoid clogging i also place a small round piece of filter paper that i cut out from normal melitta filter to perfectly fit the bottom of the perforated part one melitta filter give me 14 small piece and i cut 4 filter at the same time which is pretty fast and i now have 56 piece to further avoid clogging i weekly clean the filter by putting a 1 3 tsp of baking soda in the filter basket and run 2 3 water shot and then rinse the part a mentioned this is pressurized system but it would be very easy to make it a non pressurized system just drilling the one small hole to open it further i will try on the 1 shot filter to see how it work,so did you try to depressurize it,why do you make coffee the wrong way round is it an american thing,jacques du plessis i think it mix better this way also,hi what microphone set up do you use for your camera please,i wa buy this little machine super i recommend,i not disaster,why do not you make review about delonnghi 3351,thanks for posting it great video i am setting up a bike caffe a small business where i will serve espresso on wheel do you think i could use that gear dedica in that business thanks,for what a stranger on the internet opinion worth you would struggle to pull it off due to the temperature fluctuation between steam wand and espresso with this machine due it single boiler you will have inconsistent shot if selling latte and cappuccino and if you plan on making any quantity of espresso the water will be quick to overheat and it wont be so great the pressurised portafilter while convenient will not give you the kind of shot that a dedicated grinder fresh bean and correct grind size and extraction will you will be far more suited to aim for something in the prosumer market instead with a dual boiler coupled with a good quality grinder use the rancillio rocky a a point of reference if you any question i am happy to help just pop me an email at elevatecoffeetraining gmail com the world always need more coffee cheer,not bad but it cold hahahaha i do not like to drink cold coffee at all and i have tried delonghi machine it not giving hot coffee,scg ha such helpful video and always spot on i would like to know how many ounce of milk they pour and more milk foam froth detail maybe there is a video on that,love this channel i got a used ec155 about 6 month ago after discovering this channel have not used the deluxe but i would be willing to say that this machine is not worth the price difference of a 155 if you are just getting into espresso and wan na try out a cheap machine you can easily find a used ec155 for about dollar40 on ebay and clean mod it just a bit for about the same quality of drink at dollar350 i would probably save up a bit more for a breville just seems a bit more cost efficient,plastic in critical part shame i do not mind plastic body but plastic in steam line is bad,just bought this for dollar220 and it came with a free grinder best purchase ever,not sure about the machine but i love the presenter,thankyou so much for this review i will run to the nearest store to get this delongi coffee machine,or maybe you can buy it from the company that just spent time and money on a sale pitch,great vid cheer,helpful thx,nice reviewer sold,i regret why i bought nespresso citiz and saw this video,i blew mine up trying to get too much flavour out of each coffee packed the basket too tight machine deceased your relationship with the milk wand is more amicable than mine wa you present very well maybe a career in this field,i already have the dedica 680 amp love it i do not see anything that would cause me to covet the deluxe,i have the same one and i had try many different coffee and i can not get the coffee to make foam,i have just purchased delonghi ec 685 and right start from the first use it is not delivering hot water or steam i do not know what o have to do with brand new dedica,gale you are amazing never seen this channel and i do not even drink coffee but i subbed p,so i bought the ec680 2 month ago i took off the pressurized basket and bought a non pressurized one all i had to do wa remove the plastic piece inside the portafilter trim it down a bit put it back in place and inserted the non pressurized basket it work like a charm with that i bought a capresso grinder which manages to just about doe good grind for an espresso shot i put in 17g dose in the basket take about 25sec for about 34g yield espresso this is the biggest upgrade you do not need to change this machine if you do this upgrade a i get amazing shot there is such a massive difference in taste a well a the experience,harin dharmanandan what ground coffee do u use,what setting do you use on the capresso,hi guy fun review loved it i went and bought the dedica after seeing the review i like it so far but the amount of coffee it give is tiny i know it is espresso but come on you say in the video that the button are programmable but i think it is only for temperature and water hardness can the amount of coffee be programmed i have to press twice on the middle button to fill my cup thank you great channel,if you hold the button either one or two cup the coffee wil flow until you release it this volume will be saved by the machine and all your following shot will be the same volume,great review thank you,i like your energy very informative vid thanks,is it just me because i bought a machine on the european market or is delonghi a little off the standard the single cup button give me 50ml 1 7 oz and the double cup button give me 100ml 3 4 oz should not it be 30ml and 60ml 1 and 2 oz i know i can reprogram the button but how it is done seems pretty inaccurate to me,i found the same thing though it doe depend on coffee grind size and like others i find grinding for this machine deeply frustrating you can of course change the volume delivered by pressing and holding the 1 or 2 cup button until you get the desired amount then releasing the button to program it,i had one of these machine from about 14 month ago that had all these feature the boiler split and delonghi replaced it instead of repairing the new one i got is garbage the old one while loud made great shot with perfect crema i am a car guy not coffee but now it pours bugger all crema and leaf two gaping big black spot in the middle of the cup the basket come with a removable bottom now,,you are a delight a a reviewer lot of info and good showing continued success gail,0 50,honestly i just love gail haha she make me crack up and i watch video after video because she is just so great on camera keep it up,i have one it is great for home thanks for the review,mohammed al shuaili how is it holding up,this wa a treat to watch even though i am a 19 year old male i can not put my finger on it,is there any kind of water filter softener to place in the water tank for this machine,the manual read that there is one you can buy from delonghi there is a spot for it in the tank,do not think so i just use mineral water a i live in an area with very hard water the descaling alarm is basically just a counter that trigger after a certain number of us i think i pretty much ignore it now,can this machine make thicker coffee than this how do the barista in the cafe get the really thick coffee,fantastic thanks for the review,wa gon na ask wtf happened to your eye,i mean 5 17,5 23 that is what she said,i suspect the deluxe branding is just the term for the ec685 whereas the previous model wa the ec680 happy to stand corrected but i can not see any use of wouldeluxe in online store here in europe just ec685 with a suffix depending on colour m for metal bk for black r for red there is also a white version a demonstrated here but is often sold at a premium,this is true i just ordered the ec685 m and it ha all the new feature this wouldeluxe ha,i have the regulat dedica machine i do descaling on it twice a year changed the portafilter every year because it clog and it doe not matter whar type of coffee i use it will not have much brown froth foam do not matter if i tamp it little or too much sometimes the coffee drip instead of flow also feel like the machine is really trying a double shot barely count a a single show in volume i do not really like this machine bought a breville machine for my mom that cost twice a much sooo much better,what step on a rocky grinder would you suggest for it to come out smooth and not bitter,i have the standard machine and honestly there is very little difference having lived with one for a couple of year are there any downside the basket are impossible to clean and if they get clagged up totally knackered you can however get replacement basket on amazon with the bottom tray removable so you can clean them otherwise it is a pretty decent machine,hi gail i just bought my delonghi deluxe and rocky grinder but i still can not find the siting to make a good espresso do you have any recommendation,jen neuman yes do not grind very fine when using a pressurised basket use slightly coarser ground and you will get nicer espresso,i am using it in my coffee shop and it is amazing small and easy to use good choice for newbie,how is it doing now did you ever get a chance to have multiple customer waiting in line how long do you have to wait per shot,purchased the dedica a week ago and smashed through coffee that weekend love the machine great size which fit well on my kitchen work surface really easy to use and the espresso produced is fantastic make quick frothy milk ideal for flat white art bought my machine for gbp140 00 i have replaced the plastic tamper though useable is not ideal,where did you find it at that price,hi my sunbeam em5600 is getting a bit old and looking for a replacement how would you compare the dedica to the breville bes840,how much doe it cost in dollar,3,wow what a cool woman you are,5 19 that is what she said,hi dear i really like all your video including your fantastic humor thanks a lot,that lady is a great presenter,2 year later still such an awesome presenter,love gail,agree,death metal nah make her even cooler tbh,can i keep it switched on because of it automatic sleep mode because the power switch doe not seem to be the best at all love that machine good coffee for low price,still can not figure out where is the air intake of the panarello steam wand wish they upgrade the wand to those standard frothing wand instead of that standard panarello wand,i got a new delonghi machine ecp 35 31 it us the same filter basket of dedica but every time i brew an espresso i end up with a dirty brew head is that normal,hi gail do you know any good espresso machine that ha no plastic in the portafilter,for the hot milk mode doe it act like a traditional wand can i create decent microfoam with the hot milk mode on the steam wand,tina misu wang yes you can,tina misu wang no it just heat the milk with no foam,we have such machine at work and ok it is ok but when i have enough money to spare i am going for pided silvia and some grinder bottomless portafilter etc,i have old dedica and i would change it only for the colour i just love the look of white version mine is black and that is all i can not see any reason to buy it other than that so if you are person that do not have it yet just buy standard non deluxe version it is cheaper and i think that they already have even white color black metal red and white right now and i had to choose between black and metal when i wa buying it about machine itself it is really great of course it will not make perfectly foamed milk but still make decent one and i am sure it can do better with steam wand modification,i just got my standard one in black but am considering spray painting it the only downside is that i will void my warranty,huh 51mm tamper are quite common i picked up one on amazon for gbp10 the same price i paid for my delonghi bco410 on ebay,joe o sullivan aliexpress also ha 51mm tamper for anyone interested,gayle i love listening to you speak very american and funny,what is the most appropriate standard grinding coffee for this machine,fine grind,oh gail ha ha ha,can this be used for business or just for home,strictly for home use for business use you will need a high end espresso machine which usually cost a few thousand,thanks for the great video review gail almost returned this unit until i saw your video and learned what i wa doing that wa wrong,how many mm is the tamper for the dedica,51 mm,absolutely love the styling of this machine just wish they had an option that looked the same but offered higher end feature such a 58mm porta filter and steam wand rather than panarella add in some programability and you would have a winner,she is such a sweet heart,you mean he hehe,i got the exact same machine but it can not seem to extract fine grind grinder is the breville smart grinder pro i barely apply any pressure to even out the ground when temping it only drip with barely any coffee coming out in 10 second espresso taste sour help,go coarser with your grind the breville say a certain range is espresso but that is just a guideline also with the pressurized basket be very careful with fine grind there is only one hole on the bottom of many style of pressurized basket and it can be easily clogged with fine coffee grind soak your basket overnight in very hot water with cafiza powder dissolved and try brewing with the grind set to a notch or two coarser than you are using now,cornyroll i had te same problem i could not make double espresso i took it to service but delonghi said i put too much coffee two of their cup is too much for double basket idiot after that i complained to shop where i bought it and they managed with importer to give me new one this one work ok if i put much coffee and tamp hard it will choke but the old one choked with le coffee and no tamping so my conclusion is take it back where you bought it it is broken,i changed the wand on mind the standard one are terrible,do not take the plastic out of the portafilter you will have a great big screw holding the bottom,4 25,nice,gail is the best,do not forget to check her highly acclaimed video on latte design,i have had the dedica standard version for over a year now just some pointer 1 the plastic part in the portafilter doe not come out a far a im aware 2 the cup warmer ontop of the machine is non exsistent the temperature is hardly any different to the cold temperature of the bench it sits on 3 the milk steamer need to be cleaned after every use a the milk get stuck inbetween all those part the rubber and metal etc you can not just blow it out with hot steam 4 it look like they have improved the milk steamer with more frothy milk which is good 5 overall it a good little machine and im very happy with it and thouroughly recommend it to anyone it is the best in it price range when i bought it over a year ago,allison pell so do i,there is a screw on the portafilter by the nozzle that allows you to take the plastic part out agree on it being a great little machine i would not live without mine now,dedica come with pre brew or you can program it thanks,look like that frother would fit the older model a well wonder if they sell it separately,i would not rush out and buy the upgraded machine i have the original and it is not drastically different tamper you can get one amazon for around five pound 51mm otherwise it pretty much do is what it say and it make a pretty decent cup of coffee for the money only thing i would add is you a cup or something for when you put the steamer on a you get a squirt of water before it start to steam,bought my son the dedica for christmas we really enjoy the taste speed and simplicity of this unit always a pleasure to watch your entertaining review thank you,look identical to smeg is machine maybe even the exact same machine that is just branded differently are smeg and delonghi somehow related,smeg wa second delonghi made it first so smeg ripped off design it is 100percent the same machine with just changed outside design,i have the smeg seems to be the same internals with a different coat best machine i have had,i want the gaggia classic i did not realize your a store,hi gail great review i have this machine but my coffee come out tasting very watery what am i doing wrong could it be something with the water teperature keep up the good work cheer from sweden,final bos have you tried a finer grind setting with your grinder i have a different machine but i have to dial in the right fineness with my grinder for each different type of bean i use the store grinder absolutely doe not work with my machine,hi there did you manage to make better coffee cause i have just bought this machine with the delonghi kg521 grinder a few day ago and to be honest i am not really that satisfied with the shot i pull they do not really have a body i know it is a pressurized basket so i am ordering another basket and maybe a second portafilter a well to make bottomless to do a non pressurized basket mod maybe that will make thing better compared to my capsule machine before krups dolce gusto it is not that better anyway if you by any chance got some tip that helped you grind size tamping whatever i would like to hear them,i got this machine and wa really disappointed in it espresso wa not hot enough flavor wa just ok i switched to breville infuser and love it so hot amazing crema and flavor,can anyone recommend a nice grinder that is dollar100,badnercalabrese the gvx212 it is only dollar46 in the u any opinion on the gvx1 it is about dollar10 more these are burr machine right,how much,what you get is a lot of plastic for your money with a pressurized portafilter you do not make espresso just coffee,what aeroplane have you been on,what is the difference between the dedica style and the deluxe,i just do not understand why delonghi doe not use standard 58mm porta filter 51mm is really odd can not get any accessory with this size,well i am using a la pavoni and we are also using 51 49mm portafilters 58mm are usually for higher end commercial machine,surprised i do not have trouble finding accessory but you are right why do not they all stick to 58mm and provide a portafilter to hold a standard volume of ground,but have they cured the leaking problem i had to return 3 unit straight away because of massive leak from underneath we changed to a different model which is fine we are not alone,the manual mention that an excess of water under the tank would be normal and should be dried up when needed,my standard version dedica literally arrived within hour of this video can not wait to test it btw thanks gail another great video,luciano mieldazis did you test what about espresso in this machine,best budget grinder for dedica pressurized basket,the gvx212 is dollar46 u any idea if the gvx1 14 is any better or the difference,50 60euros,domo delonghi krups severin sencor russel hobbs have same internals difference is in the motor chasis and price i wa looking at capresso infinity called in my country nivona cafegrando cost about 80 90euros but mby there is something better then that,thats 300euros for grinder and ec685m cost me 180euros im looking for something cheaper about 1 2 price of machine friend owns graef cm 800 and it grind too fine for pressurized portafilter and cost around 150euros,how about feima 600n or 610n it is taiwanese but not bad for it price,i first watched the video on my phone and i wa shocked i wa like what is wrong with your eye gail now that i am on my laptop i can see you have the basket on whew thanks for explaining the difference between pressurized and unpressurized basket i hope you and the crew had a great holiday break happy new year,1 thing that seems to hard to pinpoint is the grind size the pressurized filter doe not allow espresso sized grind you need to go a little bigger that is why dedica grinder is a must buy,badnercalabrese that is my exact setup it work well enough for what i need,i set my grind size about half way between fine and medium any smaller it clog up any coarser and it is weak if i buy ready ground coffee from the supermarket i run it through the burr grinder to take it down a big finer and you get a much better coffee,i heard de longhi say extraction time for these machine is 18 21 second so i assume just adjust your grind setting to get that extraction time,i have a delonghi with that type of portafilter when i go to tap out the ground the little filter always come out any idea why i end up having to poke the ground out with a spoon in order to not fish the filter out of the trash,haha i got ta tip do not knock it out on the sink snap your wrist in the air above the bin without knocking it on anything it will come right out,wow so i am not crazy at least not about this i do let it cool sometimes i accidentally leave the ground in there until i make another cup,cool down the basket for a while 30 or le and u will be fine,activediabetic because these type of machine doe not have three way selonid valve after brewing a coffee there is no sucking the wetness out of the puck that is why is doe not work by knocking out the puck,dollar100 more expensive than previous version not much upgrade to justify that better to go for breville duo temp pro instead of this or capresso ec pro,same in sweden just bought the 685 for 150 euro my old 680 wa 200 euro 3 or 4 year ago the pump stopped working on the old one but i still decided to by the 685 a i wa very satisfied with the coffee it made,in my country it cost the same if not even cheaper than 680,just bought the ec685 for 144 euro that is dollar166 can not really complain about the price even filter coffee machine like moccamaster cost more,i got a 51mm calibrated tamper on amazon for 21 buck so far it is my favorite thing from amazon,score,jason whitton tamper in china can be bought for dollar5 or le,the dedica is a fantastic machine so simple yet so capable and a packed with so many feature for the price the first thing i did wa remove the panarello frothing nozel and just used the rubber nozel underneath with a bit of technique and a small milk pitcher you can create surprisingly good milk to make latte art some may even call it microfoam also if you remove the plastic bit in the porter filter you can actually fit a 51mm non pressurised basket found one on amazon called magideal coffee 2 cup 51mm only 4 quid and work a treat,tina misu wang if i understood well the rubber part the nozzle for froth if this is it then the problem is simple you must wash off the nozzle disconnecting it from the metal outer part if there is a i do not know this maschine in particular once milk get hard there it block the way for new milk the pressure push the rubbef down,hey scott i just got this machine and i am wondering what is the best grind setting on my delonghi burr grinder all the way to fine,utsav soni if i got you right you mean two different coffee brand if so it is normal the need to adjust the dose and grind to achieve comparable yield you can try and revert with the result and yes if there is no output from the espresso machine you can melt the pump i would stop once there ha been 10 15 sec with no output,hello scott is it possible to change the steam wand tip to change it for a 2 hole 4 hole tip thanks for the insight,scarface4u2 hey so i bought the machine and it working really well i have a question to run by you i used two coffee with the same espresso grind and using the same pressure to pack it then why doe one pour a good 60 ml shot and the other one hardly 10 ml i am not complaining about the taste but will the one taking longer time to extract damage the machine kindly enlighten me,hey guy big fan i wa wondering which one of the following would you believe make a better cup o coffee siphon chemex v60 aeropress french press,kalita wave or siphon if you want to spend the money,aeropress and french press are awesome,de gustibus non est disputandum in matter of taste there can be no dispute it is a matter of personal preference some like the way french press produce the body some like it better with siphon but to me i like how aeropress creates the body it feel bolder and with metal filter it taste richer than paper filter but when i want a thinner body or le stronger taste i felt pour over can delivers i think it come down on how the contraption work pour over have some what le contact with the grind a the water pass through and for the press well it press the grind and this extract the grind to some extent of course the bean quality the roasting grind size water quality temperature etc and many other thing that can change the end result to which eventually come down to de gustibus d,i have this machine and i have to correct you on one thing it actually allows me to make latte art i would recommend it to people who just got into coffee and brewing to learn more about it i will definitely upgrade to a better machine that allows non pressurised brewing but until then i will keep enjoying this machine,you can use non pressurised basket with this machine a well i agree with you about upgrading to a real espresso machine which is capable of producing good crema do not forget to buy a good grinder,u drawn a baby dinosaur,the original version look much better in my opinion i can only hope that the painted surface are metal and not plastic the original also ha a removable tray to fit tall cup though without the metal drip tray on the very bottom so the only worthwhile new feature is the dual mode panarello i have the original version work very well and make great coffee without taking up too much space on the counter,i just ordered the ec685 it come in different color i chose the metal design,i wa hoping to upgrade my old dedica for this machine expecting it would come with unpressurized basket and non penarello steam wand guess i will stick to my old one with self upgraded non pressurized basket and naked portafilter,you can order 51mm non pressurized basket from ebay cheap but they take a while,nice review
4,what feature do you look for in an espresso machine,doe it still work fine,micah robert you want to get a machine that ha 2 boiler so the water and steam are heated seperately but they are quite a bit more expensive,non pressurized basket standard no fancy steaming wand is enough for me,one that is able to steam without overheating that quickly,good froth love cappuccino,came here because i like the machine but that milk wand is a bear the fat wand just aerates too much and it overflow the pitcher anyone else have this problem or know how to resolve it,i have found that you can unscrew the fat part of the wand and it is a much smaller silicone one underneath it is not a good a replacing it with a metal one but it is an easy thing to try,hello what are size of your cup when you brewed for 2 cup my cup are 5 oz will it work for them,hi i have the model ec685 and i use the double shot until where should i fill it,it is an excellent premium coffee machine for a family,great tute,when i grind coffe bean to nearly a powder this machine can not handle it also i am struggling with amount of coffee that go to cup seems like it is not enough even for one espresso when using double espresso button can anyone help me with that otherwise i will have to return that machine,thanks for the review unfortunetly i really wanted to hear how loud it wa but you played music over the actual coffee making part,jj shankles thanks so much for that info,sorry about that i just measured it with an app and the brew cycle wa between 50 52 db which is below a normal conversation steaming milk wa a bit louder between 65 70 db i can easily carry a conversation during the brew cycle i think my grinder is louder than the brew cycle,hi i had an updated version of this coffee machine for christmas i love it been using illy coffee in it thank you for the video can you change the temp of coffee,i am not sure i have not messed with changing the setting but i think it might have some adjustability of some setting,just got this machine for christmas and so far so good it made great espresso i am still learning the cream method hope to save drive through money ha,you need to speak more succinctly just get to the point,i can not get the coffee holder part to go in how do i do that,doe it come with the cup will a mug fit underneath,jj shankles i have read some bad review is there another you recommend in the same price range tired of returning them lol,it did not come with the cup but i just move the drip tray and a mug will fit when i want an americano or latte,where did you get your espresso cup and what type of coffee bean do you recommend thanks,the machine keep on blinking after you make a coffee how do you make another coffee after that do you need to restart the machine every time i am struggling to make multiple cup of coffee one after another,difference against ec785,the ec785 ha what they call a more advanced milk wand i do not think it would be worth paying more for,aah thank you for this tutorial it helped especially when using the steam,thank you i am so glad it helped,i followed what you did step by step with the same basket and choosing the same double shot button but it only dispensed 1 5 to 1 6 of the same cup you have do you know what could be the problem,this could happen if you are grinding too fine or you are tamping too hard to make sure the machine is working fine you could just run it with no coffee in it to make sure it dispenses the correct amount of water through a cycle,would i need to buy a grinder to use with this,it need finely ground coffee so if you get espresso ground coffee then it should work,iv got this machine but my nozzle is the one ur talking about with it been longer and it is really good must be an update one maybe,m j yes it is the one with longer nozzle yeah i will continue to look at the video i already got it to make le noise practice make perfect,is ur one the long nozzle mate mine is and i got it working good and milk is sweet type it into youtube and there is a couple of video to get ur head around it that is what i done and i make them so good now,yeah i got mine also today but i am struggling so much it is got a different nozzle from video but otherwise exactly the same it is making so much noise i am afraid my neighbour is going to start to complain i must be doing something seriously wrong i will try again tomorrow,th nks jj i like your easy to understand presentation,you are welcome,thanks for this brother,i am glad you enjoyed it,in order to get more foam you should try aerating the milk first for about 4 ish second so basically you keep the stream almost at the top of the milk and you hear this sound almost like paper ripping and after you put the nozzle all the way in to finish foaming the milk for a cappuccino you can aerate the milk for about 7 10 second which will produce much more foam a cappuccino is mainly foam and a little bit of milk but thanks for the review of the machine,thank you for that tip i have felt like my foam game could use some improvement,got this new machine this week pulled out a double shot perfectly but the milk steamer is not working a expected when i use it it work for like 2 3 second and then it go off and the single and double coffee light blink what am i doing wrong here,it is a constant blink or blinking 3 time then a pause the constant blink mean it is not hot enough just let it wait for a minute before trying again,hows it working now i have heard these go to shit after several month,i still use it usually more than once a day and it still make great espresso,look good i have the lavazza mini and it is working great but this machine may not last too long so i think this delonghi maybe my next machine,this delonghi is still working great over two year of use,great review what is your preferred ratio for the single and double shot,mine ha had really mixed result sometimes good like the one you are making sometimes cold or weak the coffee only come out of one of the two exit wodering if it might be faulty any thought,it could be too fine of a grind on the coffee bean or tamping too hard you could take the stump apart to make sure nothing is blocking one of the exit if the brew is taking over 20 second from first flow to finish then it is probably too fine a grind or over tamping,great vid what grinder do you use thanks,i have that exact capresso grinder it seems to have quite a bit of retention any suggestion to make it better,what do you mean retention mine ha been going good for a few year now,cool review thanks,i am italian please learn how to pronounce the name of the manufacturer of the appliance that you present,you have the same voice a jakenbakelive,you totally waited too long to pull your steam instead of resetting the machine you can pull hot water to come down from steam temp to brewing temp that is what happened smooth play off though someone who doe not drink 6 cup a day for the past 5 year form this machine will not notice a thing,very observant yeah it wa just an issue of adjusting thing for filming usually doe not take a long when i am not trying to record at the same time,i can not seem to attach the filter into the insert to put in espresso is there a trick or how to line it up,4 03 pitcher ok man i quit,hahaha,you make putting the coffee holder in so simple i am having trouble getting mine in how do you do this,nick bavea it might be that you have too much coffee in the tamper he showed help to level thing and ensure you do not have too little or too much,i have the same machine and in mine the group i think it is called take a lot of effort to properly lock in place is that normal,do not press too hard,great review,whole heartedly agree with this except when he said that the milk frother is not very customisable and give you the same foam every time is not true i have been experimenting after watching multiple video and im now quite able to make very frothy steamed milk while also being able to make a small amount of foam but steam the milk nicely think of the difference between a latte and a cappuccino also the machine did not overheat although someone already addressed that,i got same machine for about a year now work nice and make great espresso,so much faff i will pas,tr s int ressant merci,great review thanks,doe it collect fingerprint on the front plastic i mean it color seems to be susceptible to that,can it make americano,goattoaster thank you also wondering what the brew temperature is,yes just brew the espresso in a mug then add water,i have found if you move the milk jug up and down it a you rotate it it doe make more foam xx,can you make tea with this,you could use the nozzle to boil water into a cup with a tea bag in it,delonghi is machine is very good i use magnifica s and it taste too good and i drink too much coffee the video wa very helpful with love from japan,i tried reverse order i first frothed the milk and then when i switched to espresso the light keep flashing i then have to turn off and then turn back on and then the button are no longer flashing i will go back to first making espresso before frothing the milk but i wa just curious if anyone else ha had this problem,after frothing the milk you can not make espresso immediately if the 2 espresso button are flashing a it indicates that the boiler is too hot and the machine will not let you to prevent burning the coffee all you need to you is to turn the steam dial and let it cool down you will know it is ready when it is no longer ejecting water,gross dude you do not let espresso sit like that steam the milk first and add the shot asap when it turning black like that it mean the shot ha gotten bitter,this is so true usually it doe not sit around like that just when filming the video it had to sit around so i could film it,how do i fix it when it seems like the pump is not pumping well it ha been completely cleaned it seems like all home espresso machine work for 2 3 year then have pump problem,in this video you are cup are quite full do you push the brew button more than once i have got the same machine and find that it doe not brew much in fact the two cup button brew le than the single it doe not make sense,you can preprogram each setting by holding the button for a long a u want the water to flow so u can end up having more water in one shot mode than two,what is up with the black plastic in the steel holder they give you woudnt they burn if the hot coffee is coming through it,this review helped me decide on buying this machine over others how did you so easily swing lock that portafilter when i try to do it it feel like it get stuck towards the end and i have nearly toppled the machine over doing so any advice,your dose the amount of ground coffee in the portafilter is too much just reduce it until you can turn the portafilter properly,great video,do you know of a good similar model that come with a steam wand rather than a frother anymore steam wand are not professional a they are easy to learn in just a cup or two so you can make your own decision whether you want a latte or cappuccino and without overheating when you use it too damn this model just plain suck the ideal machine would be a company considerate enough to throw in a tamper with it is filter so you can use the thing out of the box,most company will give you a cheap plastic tamp just to get going i will probably go for the gaggia classic later but for now after my breville died in le than a year barely more than half a year i have just ordered a cheap as chinese machine it may well turn out to be unreliable rubbish but so wa my breville and the one i have ordered ha a real steam wand proper 58mm portafiler a pressure gauge and obvious rip off copied button like the breville range for a tiny fraction of the price it is called a gemilai crm3605 wish me luck,why the music i wanted to hear the noise level but instead got your music of choice i wa watching the video from the beginning and waiting to press that start button to hear how loud it is instead you played music frggin mozzart bro,how long doe it typically take to preheat the machine,jj shankles great thanks for the quick reply,i just tested and it took 40 second to preheat,bought this for myself and my husband for christmas should have watched the review first i will be taking it back,thanks dude got my wife one for christmas and your video had u making the perfect coffee in minute,he actually doe not do it quite properly,thanks i am so glad i wa able to help merry christmas,what a great tutorial i wa feeling overwhelmed with all of the tutorial until i found yours thank you,i just got one and yes it get some failure i used it in the morning and it wa good i used it like at 2 pm and i wa good i used for my mom at 5 and it wa good but i used like 7 30 or 8 pm and u could not get single nor double shot it just would not come out not it is not the first time so idk if i should give it back or what,can this make a regular americano too just plain coffee cause my grandparent are drinking only that but i drink only latte and cappuccino,why do not you pour the espresso directly into your glass mug seems like it would be easier to skip washing the espresso glass can the mug fit underneath,it wa just to film it brewing like that on a normal day i just brew it into the mug,can this make an americano,thanks,am i the first to notice your nice le creuset mug,you are the first to point it out i love how cute it is,great honest review look like something i would consider buying i consider it overheating very minor but great to actually see it in the review,the way you frioth the milk is so not the right way i have worked a a barista for 6 year,hey man great video thanks much respect,i want this machine,no satisfied with the demonstration of the steam,what is your grinder i have been looking for one like that,what grind setting do you use on your capresso looking into getting this machine and i have the capresso grinder already,goattoaster thanks so much since it is been over a year since you have posted this do you still recommend it,i grind it between fine and extra fine,this guy convinced me not to buy this machine,katsu it is not about the machine is more about his review xd,why is that i consider buying it,can you do art with this,i have tried but i am not good at it i am sure if you tried enough time or were good at it then this machine could make latte art,my machine will not make the espresso it overheated any suggestion,great review thanks,i bought one just know im so excited to try it i hope it be received early,how do you like it,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,steam wand is very small and the hot water splashing out make a real mess a well a whenever you wan na froth the milk you got ta remove the coffee filter holder which is kind of a drag,hi the tamper is 53mm thanks,51 mm,thank for the feedback,you had me at the gallon of milk smashing the pitcher on your counter super funny,we can not make this machine make dense coffee it always come out tea style i e present this machine to my mom but it just doe not work i hardly believe our coffee can come out like yours i played with water hardness temperature nothing help i should have returned it back in time to amazon,addk3 i had the same problem wa very frustrating no matter what i did the coffee came out bitter and watery so i started watching tutorial and finally fixed my problem now my espresso is perfect and better than anything i tasted before at any coffee shop now i did many thing such a buying proper grinder non pressurized filter proper coffee and the same tamper he us but before doing all of that i learned one technique that you can try right away and it might just work without all other thing i learned that there must be a space between coffee level and the top screen from where water come out i always thought that coffee should touch that screen and loaded the filter a such that wa a big mistake if you think that you may also load too much try loading le and compress harder test your load lock it into position and remove do you see any scratch on the coffee surface are there any coffee grind on the metal screen of the machine if yes then you are loading too much apparently it is important that water fill the empty space called headroom first and then start sipping through compression is very important press hard and make sure it is levelled watch some video how to press properly these two thing headroom and proper compression should make a big difference adding all other thing i mentioned will elevate it to all new level,doe it include the cup for the milk,no mine did not come bundled together i had to get it separately,we bought this about 18months ago and still love it,thank you goattoaster just bought this one and trying to figure it out never owned one before this wa very helpful can you recommend a coffee bean grinder that is not too expensive i see one on your counter there thanks,thank you for this review you lovely soul,mine doe not produce any crema i did read the manual adjust the temp setting primed the machine by releasing 100ml of water through the nozzle and made more than 5 attempt one of the worst coffee experience i ever had the coffee wa too hot bitter and had no crema whatsoever,freddy fufu make sure coffee doe not touch the top part of the machine where water come out and apply more compression there must be a space between coffee and the top screen called headroom up to 3 mm is recommended the level in his video is pretty good proper compression is also very important this should make a big difference,what the tamper size 49mm or 51mm thank you,it us a 51mm tamper,i just got my machine i am not sure is my mine have problem or is just how it is i weighted my milk after steam it will have 20g more after that i found out the steamer spay some water out while i steaming the milk is it normal or something wrong with my machine,goattoaster i let some water out before steam but still have some water let out,i am not sure exactly how much it let out but initially it doe let out a bit of water while clearing the steam pipe my method is to let the machine heat up for steam then release a little bit of steam into an empty glass first to clear out that water then you can use it a normal and it will not let out a much water into your milk hope that help,hi can i use capsule too,it doe work with pod like this but not the plastic nespresso pod i have not used these personally but delonghi say they work,i have this machine since december but not it doe not have enough pressure or something else is going on that is not pouring like when it wa new i have discale it 3 time and also i live in nyc and the water is good i am almost putting it in the garbage and get a breville,that is odd i have used mine for almost 2 year and it work great still are you using the same grind setting and pressure while tamping whenever tamp too hard or grind too fine it can struggle to get at good brew,oh my god you are a life saver i work s in a cafe and our coffee machine is broken and they bought me this delonghi coffee machine and i didnt know how to steam my milk now i get it the machine wa already used and doe not have the manual thank you2222,i am so glad you found it useful,very nice and professional review thanks,glad it wa helpful,mine is out of order i need a place to fix it any suggestion,sorry i do not have any recommendation i have not needed to get mine serviced delonghi ha an official list of service center on their website or you could probably look locally for somewhere that work on coffee machine,thanks btw,just got this the other day great tutorial,it look like a nice one but the review on it are not that great also you made a latte not a cappuccino not that there is much of a difference it is just the way your poured the milk in,lol yeah that wa definitely a latte,hi i have just bought one of these based off your video can i ask why your esspressos are so much larger than mine make ours make maybe 1 5 the amount that yours doe what are we doing wrong also how can we make an americano,ragnotzo try to measure it next time proper single shot espresso should be about 30 ml only and double is 60 this machine ha a special setting a well to change temperature of you shot and amount of coffee that give each time,jj shankles thanks for your reply in hindsight the americano question wa a bit daft wa not sure if there wa a particular setting for one one last question if i may i am getting very little crema in my esspresso shot i am using illy bean with the de longhi bladed grinder do you think the inconsistency of the bladed grinder is the problem or something else really appreciate your help,are you getting a good flow i have had that issue when i put too much ground coffee in or pack it too tight also for an americano i brew the espresso into a mug and top with hot water,my rotate to close made me want to throw the machine out the window,how is it holding up where did you get tamp i am hoping to get this machine soon,it still work perfectly after a year and a half i do have to clean it about every 6 month and the tamp i found on amazon i put a link in the description but any 51mm tamp should work,sadly amazon review indicate a recent high machine failure rate i went for the breville bambino plus a it recently had a dollar100 00 price drop,i have had the reverse my new shiny bambino died after only 7 month so now i am back to using the dedica again it is a pretty feeble machine but at least it still work unlike the breville,they should have incorporated an alarm to let u know when it is preheated do you know if the machine ha this option,it honestly doe not take long at all to preheat so there is no point in that feature,i wish it had that option i have not seen anything like that in the manual,how do you get it ready for first use the instruction in the manual are confusing,i own this machine but lost the scoop that wa included do you happen to know about how much espresso equal two scoop is it comparable to two tablespoon,i think around 12 14grams is about the right amount for the double espresso basket,lauren masaitis the scoop is not ideal for beeing used to get the right amount of bean a even if you try the amount of bean will vary a lot and you should not need it a since you have to fill the cup anyway better orientate with the fill size of the cup or use a scale,one scoop is about one rounded table spoon so two scoop is a little over two tablespoon,your machine stopped frothing at around 06 33 because by the time you actually turned the lever handle to the steam position the machine switched back to the espresso shot setting your timing of this wa perfect a you can see the single shot button light up a soon a you turn the handle to steam 06 23 for some reason the steam setting only stay on for a set amount of time before the machine switch back to the espresso shot presets i am sure there is a good reason for why the machine is programmed this way,it will be a heat thing the machine would rather disable the steam wand then just shoot subcritical water into your milk,lol you messed up the steamer demonstration there mate,great video love my machine but my one complaint is that the unit doe not get hot enough for the steamer the lack of heat will stop the steamer mid way so i usually pre warm the machine for 5 minute or so after i make my espresso,jcosk8 so what position for the steam should we push the knob further to the back sometimes i think knob position play a role in here but i do not know if it is true or not,jcosk8 i think that is what i saw him do i usually do a quick release of course when you do that some water is going to come out before the steam it is just purging a bit of the line anyway it is all good i love my machine and it ha not really been a big issue,anthony according to the manual you should position an empty container under the cappuccino maker and open the dial for a few second to eliminate any air left in the circuit close the dial again so you should not draw any water just make sure there is no air caught up in the tube this is very different from the instruction for cooling the machine to make coffee again to make coffee again immediately after frothing milk the boiler must first be cooled or the coffee will be burnt proceed a follows place a container under the cappuccino maker open the steam dial to deliver hot water and cool the boiler you only need to draw hot water when you want the temp to go down to coffee making level if you draw water before wanting to use steam you are basically cooling down the machine before you start it make no sense,jcosk8 i think he is doing it correctly he first draw it down to release some of the residual water that is how it is explained in the instruction manual a well i understand that if you continue to draw water it will cool down the boiler so that you can make espresso again i think he is right in that it is not the strongest heating element so you have to let it warm up for a few minute i also have my toaster plugged in to the same outlet i do not know if that make a difference,do you do it like him if so it is wrong the down position is to draw water and bring the temp down so you can brew coffee after steaming milk if you draw water and bring the heat down then it stop midway in the steaming if you do it correctly it should not stop you will actually have to cool it down to continue using it for coffee,hey man cool video and thanks for uploading i have this machine and am having trouble getting a nice flow through the espresso it start to flow after approx 5 second and then becomes a little temperamental am i doing something wrong i am using espresso ground coffee in the double shot filter i am also tamping down well,you may be tamping down too hard if it is having trouble getting a good flow the 5 second delay is usual for it to build pressure,how do you get 2 scoop to fit i used the scooper it came with and can not get 2 scoop to fit even putting a little le than a scoop i can not get it loaded because it is too tight,are you tamping hard enough to make a little puck i do not overflow the scoop and now i usually just pour in the stump because i know about how full to make it,i have the same delonghi dedica machine but i can not get a nice crema like yours what is the trick i have the default setting should i play with temp and time setting or is it my choice of coffee any tip would be appreciated thanks,jj shankles thanks i just ground a little more with a good strong tamping yes with 25 30 sec brew time default setting and i wa able to get a little crema out of it i think i am getting somewhere thanks for the tip,are you getting a good 20 25 second brew time i still have the temp set at the default adjusting how fine of a grind you use and how hard you tamp the grind will change the brew time hope this help some,your cute,super helpful thanks,i got aluminum poisoning i do not use deodorant with aluminum my cookware seems ok i use a water filter for drinking water i have this expresso machine and idk if maybe there is aluminum leaking from this porta filter doe anyone know if the porta filter is aluminum,thank you so much i think i am going to get this one great review,ndr shr yes i purchased it last year and i love it i definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a space efficient model,how do you like it,i just got mine and it wa really noisy and leak so wa waiting to hear the noise of the pump to compare it to a working one and,the build quality is very poor pop the top and you will find a bunch of plastic component waiting to fail mine did a couple of week after the warranty ran out,i bought the same machine but at first use the sump handle just got stuck while making coffee when i pressed the double cup button to make the double shot espresso just few drop came out and nothing at all i tried to remove the sump handle it just stuck and not moving at all,jj shankles thanks a lot for your reply you are absolutely right in my case since this is my first espresso machine i grind the coffee too fine which created pressure and water through coffee filter could not pas through well i left the machine for 6 hour but still took a little more force to release the handle the next shot wa much better a the coffee wa medium grind,i have had this issue when i pack the coffee ground too tight or grind the coffee to fine sometimes when the stump get stuck like that just leaving it for a minute to depressurize will make it easy to remove again hopefully that help,what coffee grinder do you use,jj shankles thanks i am curious if the cheaper but from what i have heard is still a good grinder called wilfa wscg 2 can grind the coffee fine enough for espresso what do you think,this one by capresso,de long e eeeeeeeeeeeeeee for the pronunciation nice review,great review i just bought one and this helped me understand how to use it,did not follow review and bought it anyway got a lemon had to return it bummed me out,you are so close to better espresso get an unpressurized filter this fit my delonghi get a real wand to to make legit latte art foam even with the cover taken off that wand it is not the same here is a replacement off a 700 dollar machine that fit our machine i have done these upgrade and it definitely help nothing but preground v fresh more helped change the espresso coming out that machine then these upgrade these are the main thing that separate this machine from a breville duo temp btw my man you got ta take that wand apart after every use for sure that is the value of the pro wand harder to use but faster and le cleanup there is bad milk all up in that wand trust me mine never lost temp like that either and a traditional cappuccino is 1 3 espresso 1 3 steamed milk 1 3 milk foam better wand and another filter is no more work,thank you for a great video i brought this machine today i agree with you about it edge over the breville espresso at similar price point very pleased with my purchase it a bargain at the end of the day i m just learning how to use the machine i am getting good result but a i learn it will get better,thanks for this i have the same espresso machine but mine just drip am i doing something wrong,goattoaster 9 that is probably it thanks,that can happen if you overpack the ground or if they are ground too fine or you could try putting a little le ground in,thank you now i know what i will purchase,for the double shot in this video what cup button did you select at the top,i pressed the middle double shot button,is this independent test or is that product placement thank you for answer i am asking just because everywhere i am collecting info about espresso machine i read that is better to have a coffee in the coffee house than buying anything like this because machine like this are not able to keep stable pressure 9 bar and temperature 90 c,jj shankles thank you for answer,i bought this machine myself and wa not paid to make a review i am also not a professional barista so i do not know the specific of bar or pressure i have just enjoyed using this machine and think it make good espresso so i made this review video,,you can remove the cover from the steam wand by twisting left and pulling off now you have a wand you can use like a pro,this i wa ging to ask thx,rakanwd or you could just let it be a it is and use it like a pro cause in the end it is just a steam wand pretty simple or even better just purchase a dedicated machine from severin that doe not need steam at all for perfect latte foam,rakanwd hello may i please ask you for more information which one is suitable for dedica thank you very much for your reply in advance,pro tip,what is the daily clean up like do you remove the portion cup and rinse then just rinse the cup with the handle,daily i will leave the cup in the handle and rinse it out about once a week or two i will pull the handle out and rinse them separately to give them a good clean,i have trouble in lining up the filter underneath the machine the filter doe not slot in easily,this happens to me when i put too much coffee in the filter try putting le ground in the cup,if i do not have a grinder and in order to get a good crema can i buy the illy ground coffee for this machine,the crema depends on the type of bean some bean have more characteristic that show a nice crema layer and some le,i have used illy and made some great espresso with this machine,i have been reading a lot of review about this particular machine and it seems people have issue with longevity a reoccurring problem with leak and failing pump ha anyone else had this issue is this machine going to last,sai peri hi i have had this machine for 5 year zero issue used 1 3 time per day i can say most issue with people that think they have a leak is that they filled the water reservoir up to far it will drip out the bottom pump ha been flawless any issue with flow had been i put to much in the filter,what setting on your grinder do you use i have the same one and i am thinking of buying this espresso machine,i use it between fine and extra fine that range work well for me,if i press the powder coffee a little too hard the coffee doe not come out,jj shankles but in the video you have pressed it pretty hard,i have had that happen i think it is because the machine can not build up enough pressure to brew when the ground are too tight,my favorite very stylish look,haha you fucked up the milk with water i use a thermometer and i stop at 60 degree since this appliance is weak you do not have to move the mug that much it is not a real machine it can not make latte art either with or without milk your espresso look disgusting there is no crema at all i have this appliance for two year now at first i wa very excited figuring i wa upgrading from stove espresso pot big change however after 2 month it started to piss me off the portafilter wa just dripping and the taste wa bitter watery and undrinkable breville appliance stand in the same category this quality level doe not offer any stability in heat or quality it is pressurized basket coffee not a real espresso machine it is a fake espresso it will never get a close a a great starbucks real espresso although it is a fair machine for a tight budget looking for a heat exchanger pid e61 group head the very best that is a real machine,get an unpressurized basket,just bought a dedica but a i tried to make the first real espresso today the machine worked with huge sound but then suddenly stopped after unboxing yesterday i already made four double shot any help on that thx,mine make a lot of loud rattling noise at the beginning before the espresso start coming out i put the whole machine on a dish towel and that help a little bit but it is normal to be loud at the start of the brew,what is your favourite coffee bean,goattoaster 9 k,my go to is lavazza super crema or gran crema or illy is also a really good brand,this video wa a big help it give important setup and operation tip,nice vid straight to the point no bullshit like these other video you sir get a like,thank you for the kind word it mean a lot,doe the machine stop when the coffee is ready automatically or do you have to stop it,the machine stop when the brew is done it also ha an auto turn off feature if you forget to power off the whole machine so it will not stay hot all day if you do not turn it off,got this a a gift and it is sat on the shelf for some time a i wa not sure how to use it thanks for helping out coffee is now a feature,so disappointing no art latte,i recently bought this machine and ive been having problem with the steam wand my process is choose steam button wait till it stop flashing purge but to do the next step the other 2 button start flashing a they did in your video a you said it probably mean it over heated but the problem is that the do not stop flashing no matter how long i wait one time just to test it i waited 10 min they never stopped flashing other time i can start the steam wand without waiting but then stop just like it did on your video but then take age to be able to use the wand again any suggestion i honestly do not understand what im doing wrong,to stop the flash turn on the knob again amd it will run the water let it be around 5 sec until the water stop flowing and the flash stop thata it yoir machine is ready again,after you use steam wand when the lihts flash mean it over heated you need to open to knob and let the water floow until it stop around 5sec and the light will stop to flash amd your machine is ready again,just picked this machine up do you have to let any steam out after making the espresso but before removing the handle ground holder,no after the espresso brew i just rotate the handle off,thank you,i am glad you liked it,i have had mine for over 2 year it is getting tired now i keep cleaning it out i run vinegar through it work well for a while then it is done i think the pump is going but it ha been a good machine,i will have to use vinegar next time i have to clean this out,goatoaster at the time 06 28 something go wrong the mode that you use is to cool down the machine after foaming that by no mean is the machine overheating this is used after foaming up milk to be able to pull a espresso this mode run water thru the boiler to cool it down since espresso is made at a way lower temperature than the steam,recently bought one of these machine it worked twice then went wrong it did not produce enough pressure for the water to flow the coffee got a refund,you probably packed it too much so the water then can not flow through the ground,tua tua were using the single shot i am having the same issue only a little dribble of water come through the coffee,that is odd but good that you could get a refund,thanks for the great review what grinder do you use and have you tried many different one thanks,this is the grinder i use i have used a simple blade grinder but i really like this one,like wet yogurt,instant dry yogurt,a opposed to dry yogurt,too much bl bl bl,i am gon na get this when it get cheaper it is pointless to get such an expensive product then you have got ta get rid of it when you move from one province to another,my filter holder is stuck on the espresso machine too hard to turn the handle any idea to solve this,try loading le coffee ground in the filter i have trouble turning the handle when i load it too full,vedere gli inglesi fare un caff espresso,xdddddddddddd,nice video i bought the same machine and have now re watched the video one thing your video doe not show or maybe i missed it is how to remove the used coffee ground or puck from the machine my puck are like rock and they simply do not come out i have tried everything but i usually end up trying to slice it out with a sharp knife and then scooping the rest out with a spoon i am sure this is not the right way to do it any tip,alexander troy,suz thanks i will try that,just put the unwanted ground through another cycle the compacted ground when wet are easy to dislodge,doe not work with this cheap appliance the basket pop off,alexander troy i have used the preground illy bean but have not had issue that bad,i had a breville but it started leaking at the bottom so returned it to get the delongi both are similar and personally i prefer the delongi,hi if u do not mind me asking what exactly make u like the delonghi over the breville,i have the same machine and i have been using for a few year now couple year ago i managed to open the machine up and changed the steam wand,jj shankles thanks for such a nice practical relatable review i like your relaxed but well organized style question have you done a video on how to modify to the non pressurized use and for your non pressurized what grinder can you use i do not want to pay hundred for a grinder my delonghi is making some pretty good espresso for me but i am interested to try non pressurized if i can do it with my bodum bistro grinder thanks goat toaster oh do you like your goat toast golden brown or dark brown crunchy,how many espresso can you get in a day,i have been thinking about doing that i recently did the unpressurized stump mod and really like it,omg it tfue nice video i almost bought it ended up getting the 420 1 but now i think it a bit too big,hey man loved the review do you think picking up one of these used but in like new condition would be worth it it is nearly half the original price thanks,a m i just bought a new machine with a few year warranty just to be safe,sk8ingthemystery how would that turn out for you im in the exact same predicament it is substantially cheaper to get a like new but i am paranoid,jj shankles sweet thanks for the advice i am picking one up right now,i buy a lot of thing used from amazon and have not had any problem and the saving are substantial amazon also ha great return policy so if it is not like new you can send it back easily,i noticed that by turning the foam handle more in hot water function the pump start to run what doe it change,pretty good review,thanks,thank you a lot i have one and i love it,you will hate it when it start having orange flashing light issue,thanks for showing u how it work i just ordered mine,how do you like it,how do you like it,thanks so much for the video i got the same machine it is awesome,i love the quality of espresso for how easy it is to use now that i have worked out a good system,this wa an excellent video informative and comprehensive while remaining short and lightly entertaining thank you i will buy this machine now,the foam looked like hot milk i am sorry but u guy down there still have not yet understood the difference to have more air in the foam and avoid burning the milk to liquid againg you must touch the surface with the tip of the froathing pen only if the pen is deepened all the way in a she is doing the hot side will burn the milk and if touched the bottom the machine will overheat and stop,thank you alan i usually did it all wrong result the milk wa all over my kitchen,thanks for letting me know i will work on that i usually just drink the espresso black so i do not get much practice frothing the milk but those are great pointer i will try out,my god what a mess u making mate,haha thanks for the laugh could not agree more but a they say you do not give a ferrari to a new driver,use mine multiple time a day my heart beating really fast,lol,thank you for the review i have stayed with the nespresso machine under dollar100 for more than a decade there are many point i do not like they break so easily then i decided to switch to this delonghi dedica deluxe and it is another world feel so professional i ordered box of 150 soft pod from italy borbone napoli it is much cheaper than nespresso aluminum pod and far better and yes the foam and the aroma we love this machine i will try your technique without the pod in amazon europe your tamper is about dollar30,can you use pod,i am so glad you like it i think any metal tamper would be better than the plastic on that come with the machine but even that one doe the job,great i brought the same machine it is just a great one,mine did not come with a frothing cup,did your machine come with the frothing cup,it really is great i love how easily it make great espresso,it is a really good review i am actually only getting started with my new machine and it wa really helpful i am a former barista and it wa my dream to make this kind of coffee at home one day really looking forward to using it and make a perfect coffee with it,bezzzzo hey the silvia steamer doe not fit without some modification took me around 40 min make all the difference for steaming your milk about the unpressurised basket i find it easier to make latte art when using graef unpressurised basket hard to say what the difference is but the pouring of the milk is a lot easier to get it like all youtube video afterwards it is just practicing overall remember while modding to take time it is easy to get thing the wrong way and you will have to disassemble the whole machine hopefully this gave you some answer,mr fredriksson hi mate doe the rancilio steamer fit the delonghi machine or doe it have to be modded also with the unpressurized basket will this also help with making a flat white sorry i am new at this,goattoaster 9 yeah it give about 0 control but if you are drinking plain espresso i would really recommend go and buy the unpressurized basket cut off a piece from the plastic insert of the portaholder you would be amazed of the amount aroma and crema you will get,i have heard good thing about those mod the steam wand that come stock really doe not give much control over how the foam is made,jj shankles do this and thank me later change the steamer to one from rancilio silvia gen2 buy some unpressurized basket graef 145722 cut off a piece of the plastic in the bottom of the portafilter so the new basket can fit some people cut the actual portafilter so they get a naked look but it is not needed best of luck on your barista adventure mate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
