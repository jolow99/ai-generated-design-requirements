   Bought this coffee machine to replace an old well loved de longhi - went with the same make because we'd been really happy in the past. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then just stopped pumping - we sent it back to Amazon for repair (as it was past the return/refund time) it came back looking like it hadn't even been unpacked out of the box and wasn't working any better when we plugged it back in. Just dripping through instead of the normal flow with crema that we are used to. The video that we've shared is actually it on a good day!

   Dopo una settimana posso dire che fa un caffè ottimo. Devo dire che l' ho provata solo con Lavazza qualità rossa per moka ed è ottimo anche con questo tipo di caffè ,avevo solo quello in casa. Mi raccomando un misurino intero da  7 grammi e poi importante è la pressione. Per fare il cappuccino ho notato che il braccio si muove e si discosta dalla macchina rendendo più facile lavorare per ottenere la schiuma, (muovere  la tazza in maniera circolare aiuta a ottenere più schiuma). La pulizia è facilissima. I filtri si possono tirar via con quella guarnizione intorno che li rende molto più semplici da lavare. Il filtro per le cialde non ha il filtro removibile ma penso sia fatto di proposito. quando si schiaccia il pulsante del caffè La macchina emette per 3 secondi un rumore come se uscisse  caffè poi si arresta e riprende l erogazione. Ho letto che è del tutto normale. Come quando si fa il vapore che fa un rumore ad intermittenza. Un po' complicato regolare temperatura e quantità di caffè desiderata;inoltre, per me va bene così, ma il caffè non esce bollente come con la moka. Facilissimo pulire il raccoglitore sotto la tazzina. Per me è un' ottima  macchina del caffè paragonata anche alla precedente, saeco via venete de luxe, anche se non ho capito se quella color metal è effettivamente tutta acciaio inox e questa no o cambia solo il colore. Cmq questa nera è costata 20 euro in meno rispetto alla metal. Consiglio acqua della bottiglia e decalcificare spesso.",180 people found this helpful,Yes

So here’s the trick: if you’re using either of the filters that are for loose, ground coffee you need to add in the little removable drive-like piece with the black rubber round the outside.If you don’t add this, then the coffee grains will get stuck in the single hole st the bottom of the filter and the machine will stop pumping.Both the manual and the YouTube video don’t tell you this...  In fact the YouTube video on the delonghi website has a man that shows you the filter he uses - and he doesn’t use the drive-like insert.To be honest, the girl at customer services didn’t seem to understand anything I was saying....  and I’m still not convinced this is how they intend you to use the machine. However, customer services agreed it only works with the sieve inserted .... despite manual saying the sieve is for coffee pods.Once you do this the machine produces a pretty decent cup of coffee! I used to have a gaggia classic and have trained as a barista. This machine uses half the amount of coffee as the gaggia and seems to have more pressure to still produce a good quantity of espresso. The machine seems to adjust automatically the brew time in order to pump a specified amount of water though the coffee. This function seems to work well and serves as good feedback: if the brew time gets too long, you know you’ve tamped the coffee too hard.Ps... you won’t fit the full 2 spoons of coffee into the filter if you use the sieve insert....  it takes up too much space.

I also chose this because of how little waste there is when comparing to a pod coffee machine. I only waste the ground coffee puck but this goes straight into our green bin so no harm at all!The machine is super easy to use. I find that the portafilter is now very smooth after a few weeks of daily use. It was a little stiff at first but with a bit of practice and as the machine gets worn in, it's super easy to use. I live in a hard water area so I invested in a water filter so that I can save the internals from scaling up. This machine did come with some internal cleaner but I'm yet to get to my first full-on descaling.Filling up the water is nice and easy. Frothing the milk for cappuccino is simple and straight forward. I tend to use the Hot Milk function as I'm more of a Latte drinker.I wish this came with a better tamper than the multi-tool one it comes with. I find it hard to press the coffee into the portafilter because of the spoon being on the other end. I've invested in many tools to compliment this machine such as a black milk jug made by Rhinowares. Also, some cleaning brushes to be able to clean the small holes and pipes when doing a clean of the milk steamer.One feature which I am a little underwhelmed with (it doesn't really have any effect on the machine in my opinion) is the cup warming shelf on the top. It gets to be luke warm at the best. You can barely notice the heat from it. If I am pre-heating cups, I just run them under the hot tap. To be honest, I never really do this either...All in all, I'd definitely recommend this machine. It looks great, there's a wide range of accessories you can get direct from Delonghi and it makes a great coffee.

Secondly, there is no instrument provided to change the coffee filter which has resulted in chipped nails and pinched skin on quite a few occasions.

P. Armstrong,N/A,2.0 out of 5 stars,the United Kingdom,"November 9, 2020",N/A,"An update to my first review (that I've left below). That was a 4 star review however I've dropped it to 2,and that might be a bit generous!This machine is very flawed. After using it for three months I've come to the conclusion it is just plane hard work to use with so many frustrating quirks! There is absolutly no room for variation in using it - you have to be some precise in what you do that if you stray beyond the norm something goes wrong - it's just not pleasurabe to use. I'd say I get a faultless coffee 1 time out of every 3 or 4 brews. I've listed some points of interest.1) the coffee volumes are for midgets! We use the 2-cup grounds for one cup.2) the measure provided is too big as well. All the advice and videos say not to pack the grounds too tightly where infact if you put 2 level scoops in and compress to what you think is right it's still too much coffee and when inserted onto the mackine it gets compressed even more - to being very hard compressed - then sometimes the coffee doesn't come out. We use 3/4 scoop - and this is in fact in keeping with the volume of our previous machine's scoop.3) if you want two cups you have to recharge the (2-cup!) filter holder and reattach. Unfortunately the machine is now hot and it's almost impossible to get the filter holder re reattach as it's very very tight and sometimes just won't go on!4) it gets itself into regular and various silly modes where it (function wise) locks-up and the only way out is to unplug and start again!5) more for a warning, but even with lightly packed coffee in the filter holder it regularly doesn't work and the usual cause is the hole at the bottom of the filter holder is blocked so the routine is to make sure that's cleaned after every use - we have a piece of thin wire to do that.6) the steam milk frother is pathetic. It takes longer then the mechanical frother on our old machine - and that also gave a better quality froth that didn't collapse. Forget the DeLonghi video of the so called coffee expert - tap twice - swirl - tap again stuff as your froth completely collapses doing that.I could go on with the niggles and I'm at the stage where if it spits it's dummy out with another malfunctiin of some sorts it going back - straight to DeLonghi as I don't believe Amazon should be held responsibe for such a poor product.Original Review:I went for a De'Longhi machine as they seemed to have 'the' name in the market place for such, although quality was perhaps flagged up as an issue occasionally. However, the first impression is that this coffee machine is not the panacea I'd hope for. Our previous machine had started to become very eratic in it's behaviour so a replacement became due. The first comment relates to the quantity outputted. We put in the 2 cups insert for grounds and made two cups. Well I think it must be midgets the machine was designed for! It soon became apparent that we needed the 2-cup insert for one person, so for two of us we had to run it through twice. This then made the amount of coffee ground used a very simiar quantity for two cups on our old machine. Next was the milk. It froths very well but it says not to run the frother for more than 1 minute. Well, 1 minute is barely enough time to generate frothed milk for two cups reinforcing my opinion that the machine is designed for midgets. Then there are the little niggles like when it says not to compact the coffee too firmly in the holder - if you put two of their measures of grounds in it dosen't matter how firmy you compress it as when the holder is loaded into the machine it compreses it more anyway. Then, it's really difficult to knock the used ground out of the holder. One tap on our old machine and it dropped out where here you end up having to scoop it out with a spoon!All told I'm dissapointed. I was looking for a superior coffee machine to our 15 year old machine whereas in fact I feel I've taken a backward step. It'll have to do but I can't see this one lasting 15years as my patience will run out before then - but first I need to get some money's worth out of it. :-(",N/A,Yes

Having had coffee makers in the past it is quite easy to get the hang of it. It is quicker and quieter than our previous models and like how the coffee automatically stops. The other coffee maker needed watching to make sure you stopped it when full.

Firstly it is quite lightweight and in inserting the filter holder securely the machine moves around and it is easy to press one of the buttons inadvertently when trying to steady it. The machine has been used for single cup preparation normally which has been okay but on the occasions two cups have been  required I have had problems. I used the two-cup filter and put in two level scoops of correct coffee and tamped down but to try and insert the filter holder was almost impossible. After numerous  trial attempts and various cleaning procedures the only way this two-cup works is with only one and a half scoops of coffee which, obviously then produces a weaker strength.Then there is the obvious problem of getting two narrow glass/cups side by side on the cup holder.......",2 people found this helpful,Yes

My old machine which had lasted for 12 years was still available (rebranded) but scored only 3.5 stars. This DeLonghi rated higher so I had positive expectations. But it’s a bit disappointing and much more of a hassle than my old machine to operate and keep clean. Here are my top 5 likes and dislikes:TOP 5 LIKES:> The machine looks nice and has a small footprint so it fits nicely on the kitchen worktop> The quality of the coffee that it makes is very good; compared to my previous machine the coffee seems slightly more intense but certainly not more bitter. I think the temperature and pressure control must be spot on.> The steamer/frother works nicely: It is quite quick and gives a decent 'thickness'. You can also disassemble it all quite easily for cleaning.> The unit switches itself off after a short while, so if you forget to do that yourself, you're not wasting electricity> The two programmable buttons are very convenient for a short or long coffeeTOP 5 DISLIKES:> It is not as simple as you would imagine to go between coffee and steaming especially if you are making more than one latte. This is due to the need to cool the boiler after steaming which means you need to pump cold water through the steamer spout to drop the boiler from 100 degrees back to 60 degrees before it will make another espresso. Plus, it also seems that if you want to turn the steam on for 2 successive milk froths, sometimes the steam just stops for no obvious reason and other times it puts itself back on ""non steam"" mode and then you end up with loads of water in your milk. You need to keep your wits about you.> The decalcification cycle is too frequent and takes too long - it starts flashing and expects decalc treatment every 50-100 coffees or so and each decalc takes about 30 minutes. OK, the upside is probably that this protects your machine, but my old machine lasted 12 years without anything like such frequent cleans.> The menu system for the various options is not memorable to anyone who's not part of mensa. If you lose your instruction manual you won't know how to change any settings.> The seal in the grouphead against which the portafilter presses is quite difficult to clean (due to tight access). If you get mess on the seal (e.g. coffee granules!... no so unlikely), then the portafilter may end up leaking but putting it right is not possible with a quick wipe. I had to turn my machine upside down and try to clean the seal with cotton buds.> The portafilter has a removable filter basket which itself has a removable sieve. Seems like a good idea except that a) The sieve sometimes falls out when bashing out the used coffee granules (be careful not to lose it), and b) I think that water can get down the side of the sieve meaning that not all the liquid going into your espresso has truly been through all the coffee. Not sure about this but I've bashed out the coffee granules on a few occasions only to find that the middle of the granules are almost dry as if they've not really had much/any water go through them. That seems odd. But balance this comment with the fact that it does, nevertheless, make a decent espresso so perhaps this is normal (?).So a mixture of pros and cons. Only because my expectations were higher and the less straightforward daily operation makes me give it a 3 star rating.",N/A,Yes

Narrow and stylish, it took less space and had better features such as automatic cut off (my previous machine needed me to switch off the coffee making process manually). My main niggles are some odd design choices such as the power switch down the side towards the back of the machine rather than up front with the other controls. The other issue is that the filter is clasped into the holder using a spring metal system that means when removing coffee using the traditional hit the coffee holder against something hard method of removing the coffee can result in the filter coming loose instead. The said spring clasps might loosen over time if you are in the habit of switching between filter sizes or if u switch between ground coffee and ESE pods frequently. Another niggle is the long cool off period for the steamer. However I prefer this to be there rather than ending up with burnt coffee. But basically if you plan on making more than one cappuccino , you should make all the coffee first then froth the milk for each cup after.  Having said all that though, the pressure is good and the coffee has come out consistently smooth and creamy and the frother works well too.

You'll have to experiment a little with coffee grind (if using beans) and how hard or soft to tamp depending on grind size, but it doesn't take long to work out. Previously had a bean to cup machine which always seemed to produce a different result so this pump machine is more consistent and a big improvement. Crema isn't as good as with a Nespresso machine, but it's good enough considering this uses a pressurised filter. Can't comment on the milk frother as we use our Nespresso Aeroccino if necessary.Chose the charcoal grey version (it's not black) rather than the silver. In John Lewis the silver machine was covered in fingerprints - something that doesn't affect the red or the grey, and the grey looked classier in the shop.However ... the paint job is very poor. Just after a couple of weeks we were astonished to discover that the paint chips off to reveal the silver finish underneath. I don't know if this is a known issue or if we were unlucky with a dodgy unit, but this greatly negates the point of choosing one of the painted versions rather than the silver.

   This coffee machine is rubbish. The following issues became apparent only after a few weeks of use:1. The filter comes off the filter holder and gets stuck in the device when I try to remove it. This happens almost every time I use the machine.2. In some cases, the steam does not work. As you can see in the photo, the steam light is on but no steam is coming out.3. The frother cannot froth properly. When I put it in the 'cappuccino' mode, it still takes the milk to the boiling point before there is much froth.A friend of mine had the same machine bought two years ago and it didn't have these issues. The manufacturing quality is certainly declining.",N/A,Yes

Amazon has provided an excellent Returns service.Bought a new De'Longhi Dedica Style to replace a much used and loved one bought in Dec 2019. The original failed with flashing 1xShot and Steam lights. No help from De'longhi support as over 2 years old (by 8 months).After unpacking my new machine, I was surprised to see how many parts were now 'cheap' chromed items and not as solid as my old machine. Both have the same model number  EC685BK.However, I followed the ""First Use"" instructions. However, no water came out of the filter as expected but poured out from underneath the machine. I checked the water tank was fitted correctly and tried again. Coldwater poured out again from underneath the main body.I contacted De'Longhi, who told me that I had fitted the water tank incorrectly. This was not the case as I heard and felt it click into place. They then suggested that I send it back to Amazon for replacement or refund, but it is to the De'Longhi Webstore.  I have chosen a refund and will buy from a different manufacturer.This model, EC685, used to be an excellent coffee maker.

As always, after reading the reviews from the community (good and bad) thought it might be really unlucky if I get one with the same already reported power issue. Turned out that I was. The machine went faulty after the first initial raise and auto self test performed automatically on the first start, it won't stay on for more than 2 seconds.After several attempts of troubleshooting it, plug in/out, hold the power button etc, I came to the conclusion that the power button has a faulty design.The master power on/off button is a mechanical one, this means that when in is ON it will stay put and a little bit pressed. On the other hand, when it is OFF the button will remain aligned with the surface of the appliance. Looks like there is an issue with the system that will keep the button pressed because if you keep manually pressing the button, the appliance will stay on for as long as you can hold your finger, once you release it, it will go off.I've contacted De'Longhi ""customer service"" and they advise to me that I should claim a refund with Amazon straight away.I believe there is a major design issue on the ON/OFF button on this machine.Unfortunately I was not able to drink a single coffee from this appliance.

Se sperate di usare la macchina per farvi il caffè come al bar a casa e costi umani.... ve lo potete scordare. Nella migliore delle ipotesi otterrete un discreto caffè ma nulla più. Innanzitutto dovreste sapere che per fare un caffè sono importanti due fattori: la temperatura di erogazione e la regola dei 25. Cioè erogare 25 ml di caffè in 25 secondi. Orbene quanto caffè erogare con questa macchinetta lo potete decidere voi programmandolo. Ma questo non è sufficiente perchè non sempre viene erogata questa quantità. Il tutto è suscettibile dalla macina e dalla pressatura. Se macinate troppo fine o pressate troppo verranno erogati molto meno dei 25ml programmati (a vuoto). Ma se programmate erogazione di 30ml e poi pressate troppo poco o macinate più grossolanamente vi fate un orzo.Io sono partito dal presupposto che il caffè fatto a regola d'arte prevede la macinatura al momento. Io ho preso un macina caffè a lame (per non svenarmi con quelli di altra tipologia e fascia di prezzo) e ho fatto prove di macinatura. Peso 15g e macino tra i 30 e 35 secondi ad intermittenza, pressatura medio leggera. I parametri sono difficilmente controllabili comunque quindi non c'è mai costanza nei risultati.Il motivo è da cercare anche nella temperatura di erogazione ""ballerina"". Misurato diverse volte con una sonda è non è mai costante. Innanzitutto non ho visto differenze di temperatura tra le varie impostazioni (bassa-media-alta temperatura). Poi l'acqua non esce mai al di sopra degli 82° raggiunti con temperatura di partenza 18° e dopo diversi tentativi consecutivi. Con portafiltro e caffè la temperatura di erogazione precipita a 55° e il caffè diventa freddo dopo pochi secondi nonostante preriscaldamento portafiltro e tazza con erogazione a vuoto senza caffè.Se erogazione non è bella calda in partenza ma soprattutto ""costante"" e inutile che stiamo a parlare o fare prove. Sappiamo che una buona estrazione avviene a temperature tra gli 85° (minimo sindacale) e 92°. É normale che usando la stessa (quasi) macinatura e pressatura si ottengono risultati diversi (sempre sotto la sufficienza) se ora eroga a 70° e dopo a 75°. Anche il vapore non va al di la dei 105° (sappiamo che dovrebbe essere tra i 115 e 125° in macchine degne di questo nome).Voi direte.... è tu volevi una macchina professionale spendendo sotto i 200€? no però a questo punto mi potevo accontentare della classica caffettiera napoletana e risparmiare i soldi per un we. Tanto con il caffè macinato il risultato è uguale e spesso migliore.",15 people found this helpful,Yes

Ich habe die beiden Probleme 2-3 Mal erlebt und ich muss gestehen, dass ich jedes Mal selbst Schuld war, aber ich könnte es schnell lösen.1. Zu viel Kaffeepulver: man sollte hier den mitgelieferten Löffel nutzen um die genaue Menge von Kaffeepulver zu messen. Also, kein gehäfter Löffel sondern genau die Menge. Ein bisschen mehr wird von der Maschine noch toleriert.2. Schmutizger Siebträger: man sollte nach jeder Nutzung den Durchsieb mit einem Tuch kurz wischen, es steckt immer ein bisschen Rest, welcher über Zeit die Löcher blockieren konnte.Nachtrag, Punkt 3: auch zu fein gemahle Kaffeebohnen könnten zu Probleme führen. Außerdem sollte der Kaffeepulver im Siebträger nicht zu hart andrückt werden.Auch wenn ihr die Punkte nicht berücksichtigt habt und die Probleme habt, kann die Kaffeemaschine nach Anleitung innerhalb 2 Minuten zurückgesetzt werden. Man braucht natürlich ein bisschen mehr Zeit, die Maschine wieder zu programmieren, falls man vorher eigene Einstellungen für die Kaffeemenge, Temperatur usw. gespeichert hat.Also, anhand der Rezensionen, nehme ich mal an, dass viele die Anleitungen nicht richtig gelesen haben. Das macht mir auch kein Spaß aber wenn man alles richtig tut, braucht man das evtl. gar nicht.Der Kaffee schmeckt natürlich sehr lecker. Ich nutze persönlich die Lavazza Barista Bohnen in Lila/Schwarz Verpackung und mahle sie ein bisschen feiner als Tafelsalz aus dem Supermarkt. Der Milschäumer funktioniert auch prima.Ein Tamper muss man leider selbst kaufen, der mitgelieferte Plastikteil ist mMn. nur als Löffel verwendbar, da es nicht schwer genug ist. Es kostet aber nur € 10-20 und man kann selber entscheiden, welcher Stil man gern haben will.Also, im Ganzen und Großen, bin ich sehr zufrieden und ich kann das Produkt sehr gern weiterempfehlen.",10 people found this helpful,Yes

Mit den Siebeinsätzen hat man die Wahl zwischen 1 oder 2 Tassen Espresso. Verwendbar sind auch Pads. Welcher Kaffeehersteller die besten Kaffeebohnen für den Geschmack des Nutzers anbietet und welche Wassermenge die Richtige ist, muss man natürlich im Wege des trial-and-error-Prinzips selbst herausfinden. Geliefert wurde die Maschine bei mir ohne Siebeinsatz für 2 Tassen, stattdessen mit 2 Sieben für Pads, offenbar ein Verpackungsfehler. Dieser kleine Mangel wurde mit dem wirklich kundenfreundlichen Amazon-Kundendienst in kürzester Zeit aus der Welt geschafft.",10 people found this helpful,Yes

La macchina è bellina, ma subito mette in allarme la leggerezza. 95% plastica, qualche dettaglio indispensabile in metallo. Il software per la programmazione delle temperature è in realtà un test per il quoziente intellettivo: mai visto nulla di più irrazionale e complicato, tra sequenze di luci e tasti da premere per x secondi. Davvero poco intuitivo e pochissimo user friendly. La parte sopra, che dovrebbe ospitare le tazzine tenendole calde, a fatica le intiepidisce, e infatti nelle istruzioni consigliano di scaldarle sotto il rubinetto dell'acqua calda. Quindi insomma, una mezza presa in giro.Ma veniamo al caffé: per prima cosa il filtro va incastrato nella macchina con una discreta forza. Essento la macchina un pezzo di plastica, si sposta per tutto la cucine. Devi quindi tenerla ferma con l'altra mano, andando 9 volte su dieci a premere inavvertitamente qualche tasto... una volta fatto questo e fissato il filtro, il caffé non c'è verso di farlo uscire buono. Ho provato diversi tipi di caffè, diverse macinature, diverse quantità, diverse compressioni nel filtro. Niente, il caffè esce sempre liquidissimo (ma di quale ""cremina"" parlano altre recensioni??) e appena tiepido, malgrado i settaggi siano su ""molto caldo"". Sapore e consistenza sono quelli della moka, con l'unica variante che questo ha un po' di schiuma in più, ma aimé è solo apparenza e niente consistenza, quindi scordatevi lo zucchero che sta sulla schiuma 20 secondi prima di scendere nella tazzina. Insomma, una gran delusione, avvierò le pratiche di reso. Diciamo che se questa macchina costasse 49 euro te la potresti anche far andar bene, ma al suo prezzo la ritengo un prodotto impresentabile. Molto deludente, soprattutto da un brand come De Longhi. Sinceramente mi sono chiesto che caffé siano abituati a bere tutti quelli che hanno dato cinque stelle a questo pretenzioso pezzo di plastica.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

   👍 Voy a Intentar resumir lo q me aporta está estupenda cafetera e intentar ayudaros en la medida de lo posible en una decisión de posible compra.Vengo de una Mini Moka q duró unos 8 años y me costó entonces unos 120€. No puedo compararla realmente con esta DeLongui xq no es comparable en nada, está por debajo en todo.💯 Esta cafetera es calidad en materiales por donde se mire. Cualkier parte extraíble pesa y eso es buen principio. Tiene muy buenos detalles como pueden ser... La regulación de la temperatura del café (3 opciones), la dureza del agua de la zona (3 opciones y es para indicarte automáticamente cuando hay q descalcificar la cafetera), o lo largo q kieres los cafés en ambas posibilidades, tanto para una taza como para dos, y si kieres la cafetera en Stand By en cuando tiempo kieres se active dicho stand by (3 opciones).😍 La cafetera es preciosa y recogida, su presión de 15 bares es suficiente, la opción stand by de 9 minutos es la q tengo, pulso un botón y enseguida calienta y está preparada. Nosotros nos tomamos un café doble simplemente dándole a dos tazas y poniendo una.....😊Probé ya varios cafés ( Hacendado, Lavazza, Bonka y Saula) salvando las distancias en calidades no puedo más q afirmar q salen maravillosos de sabor, textura y con su espuma. Un consejo bueno es no kerer sobrepasar la cantidad del cazillo y dicha por DeLongui xq eso puede derivar en la rotura de la bomba. 👌Las pegas q veo es que hay q manipularla con cuidado pues al ser estrecha se mueve algo más, tambien q a la hora de poner o quitar el cazillo puedes activar un botón sin querer para q salga el café (la forma de agarrar la cafetera correctamente la puse en el vídeo) y q para poner dos tazas pues tienen q ser estrechas.Tambien si usas el espumador al coger más temperatura hay q bajarla antes de tirar otro café (es normal) en las instrucciones lo indica....... Se baja fácil y rápido 👍Como leí en un comentario y AFIRMO Q ASI ES.....hay q leerse las instrucciones bien, muchas reseñas negativas por mal funcionamiento estoy seguro q es debido a un mal uso de esta, así q leer las instrucciones y mimarla es fundamental, mi hermana tiene una desde hace más de dos años y está como el primer día!!!💪Pienso que sí buscas una buena cafetera a un precio comedido esta es tu cafetera, solamente no tiene molinillo propio ni programas q al final uno simplemente usa uno de ellos q es para tomarse un café!😊Contentisimos con esta sencilla cafetera!! ☕- Si te fue de ayuda mi reseña, házmelo saber dándole al botoncito (Útil). ¡Gracias! ;)👇",3 people found this helpful,Yes

Ich habe mir einen Abklopfbehälter gekauft, damit geht es besser.Man muss schon ordentlich ""draufhauen"", dass der Kaffeesatz auf dem Sieb rausgeht.Wenn ich zuviel Kaffee nehme oder zu fest presse, dann reicht der Druck nicht aus, dass das Wasser durchgeht.Nehme ich zu wenig, wird's auch nichts. Also wie immer: Testen und beste Einstellung herausfinden.Der Milchaufschäumer funktioniert bei mir nicht.Vielleicht bin ich zu blöd und mache das nicht richtig, aber Schaum entwickelt sich nicht in der Milch.Dabei habe ich doch extra ein schönes kleines Blechkännchen gekauft ...Fazit:Die Maschine ist ordentlich, wenn auch der Druck höher sein könnte.Reinigung des Siebträgers ist sehr fummelig, das liegt auch an den eingesetzten Siebschalen.",5 people found this helpful,Yes

Pierre,N/A,4.0 out of 5 stars,France,"May 26, 2020",N/A,"J'ai eu pendant plusieurs années la Nespresso qui m'a fait découvrir l'expresso. Mais prenant gout au café, j'ai un peu fouillé dans les café en allant goûter le café chez un torréfacteur artisanal pour voir ce qui correspondait à ce que j'aimais dans le café  Le slow coffee  est intéressant mais plus proche d'un thé ou d'une tisane, ce que j'aime dans le café c'est la texture , son corps ce coté onctueux et là  c'est l'expresso qui est roi.  Pétard il y a trois fois rien dans cette tasse est la première réflexion , puis on découvre des arômes différents , la subtilité des dilutions et des différents café. Mais quand on passe sur du café fraîchement moulu .. là c'est encore un autre monde et il existe encore bien plus de nuances que toutes les couleurs des capsules de Nespresso. Alors on regarde sur les forum du café et là on se prend deuxième claque  c'est cher les machines à expresso, et le moulin, absolument nécessaire et tout aussi important, est au moins au même prix que la machine , soit plus de 1000 euros avec le moulin.  Pour rester raisonnable faut voir coté occasion, et être patient ou chanceux. La technique pour réussir un expresso sont assez compliqués et nécessite de l’expérience. Faut voir comme ils se prennent la tête entre passionnés, c'est assez sélecte . Les machines automatiques sont comme la Dedica à filtre à pression donc en dehors de automatisme et gain place pas beaucoup d’intérêt.  Non vraiment cette Dedica est vraiment un très bon compromis pour l'expresso. Filtre  certes à pression mais du coup moulin moins exigeant .. on s'amuse en changeant de café et jouant sur le grammage le tassage la finesse de la mouture..  avec Nespresso j'avais vraiment du mal sans rajouter du sucre ,  mais avec la Dedica plus besoin de rajouter du sucre (sauf si vos grains de café était vraiment premier prix)  pour cacher l'amertume, et du coup, beaucoup plus d’arômes disponibles pour nos papilles. Bon c'est très bien pour 1 ou 2 personnes mais quand il faut enchaîner 10 cafés c'est un peu long... et le premier café est totalement froid :) . La prochaine étape sera certainement une machine à levier pour mon café du weekend. Oui vraiment très satisfait de la Dedica temps de chauffe très rapide (plus rapide que Nespresso) , elle est toute petite , jolie, bien pensée .  Et le plaisir de moudre, de  tasser son café .les odeurs.. milles petite sensations et tout un tas de petit plaisir que l'automatisme cachait... et surtout des arômes tellement plus variés en fonction des origines du café et de sa torréfaction. C'est rare que je sois autant satisfait d'un simple appareil électroménager .. alors j'ai pris  le temps d’écrire tout cela. Viva l'expresso !",8 people found this helpful,Yes

Ich habe die Maschine alle zwei Tage, wenn nicht sogar täglich genutzt. Zwar hat sie des Öfteren mal nicht mehr genug Druck aufgebaut, entkalken und/oder zurücksetzen auf Werkseinstellungen hat dies jedoch immer behoben.Bzgl. des entkalken muss ich jedoch sagen das die Maschine mir in einem Jahr nur einmal angezeigt hat, dass sie entkalkt werden möchte, ich benutze allerdings auch nur Wasser aus dem Wasserfilter weshalb das durchaus sein kann.Seit einer Woche jedoch baut die Maschine keinen Druck mehr auf und der Espresso kommt, wenn er den mal kommt nur noch Tropfenweise und in absolut geringer Menge aus dem Siebträger. Entkalken, Werkseinstellungen, auch das entfernen und reinigen des Fest verbauten Siebs in der Maschine selbst (ist verschraubt) hat nichts geändert.

(aggiornerò la recensione appena proverò altre qualità di caffè, magari non è colpa della macchina anche se ne ho provate già 3)- il caffè non è bollente per fortuna ma ho paura che con il tempo/usura diventi freddo- il dosatore è enorme proprio non riesco a capire quanto caffè vada messo (vedi dopo)- il braccio viene inserito nella macchina con sistema a vite di 45º. Può capitare di mettere troppo poco caffè e non rendersene conto in quanto il braccio più di così non stringe.- il porta tazze non ha funzione di riscaldamento e non puoi metterci nulla in quanto le vibrazioni con gli oggetti esterni, durante il suo utilizzo, possono essere fastidiose.- mi è stata spedita senza pacco di spedizione attaccando le informazioni di spedizioni direttamente sulla scatola madre.Voto finale: nel complesso, la macchina potrebbe funzionare bene ma non ha molte impostazioni di personalizzazione e bisogna adattarsi oltre a ricercare il caffè adatto alla stessa.Continuerò a provare la macchina cercando di capire la giusta regolazione di caffè e di qualità da utilizzare.Per ora 3 stelle sperando di poter alzare questa mia recensione nel futuro.",4 people found this helpful,Yes

Esteticamente la macchina nera è molto bella, dalla linea semplice con qualche cromatura che le dà importanza. E' molto compatta rispetto alla concorrenza. Solo il vassoio per le tazzine poteva essere un po' più capiente, infatti mentre è ok per la preparazione del caffè in tazzina, se si mettono contemporaneamente 2 tazze da cappuccino, queste non c'entrano e bisogna tenerle per non rischiare che cascano durante l'erogazione, quando la macchina vibra un po'.Per quanto riguarda la funzionalità, prima di tutto ho pulito tutte le parti e fatto tutte le operazioni indicate sul manuale, ma sinceramente i primi caffè non mi avevano soddisfatto. Poi è migliorata giorno dopo giorno ed ora posso dire che viene davvero un ottimo caffè. Ottima la temperatura di erogazione, fa una buona crema color nocciola, giusta la densità e la corposità finale. Anche il latte viene schiumato molto bene: non viene per niente acquoso, la schiuma è soffice e ben proporzionata al latte che risulterà molto cremoso. Ha tutte le caratteristiche per fare un ottimo caffè e un ottimo cappuccino, soprattutto per chi, come me, non si accontenta dei caffè già pronti in capsula e preferisce un vero espresso di qualità al costo di 1/5 di uno capsula. Unica nota stonata è la piastra in metallo per scaldare le tazzine che sembra non funzionare, o comunque non si scalda subito, ma per me non è un problema perché non la userei comunque e non aspetto molto tempo dall'accensione all'erogazione. Consiglio sempre di fare un caffè a vuoto prima di mettere la miscela e fare il caffè in modo da pulire e scaldare il braccetto.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

Non sono d'accordo con quanti affermano che il caffè non è caldo abbastanza! E' vero che l'ho ""tarato"" al massimo calore ma, appunto a questa temperatura, è perfetto! Più caldo ancora sarebbe imbevibile al momento e occorrerebbe aspettare per berlo...(secondo me, ovvio!). Trovo questa macchinetta strepitosa per la semplicità, estetica, funzionalità e risultati. Attualmente ho provato un paio di miscele di caffè di note marche e le ho gradite entrambe. voglio provarne altre solo per arrivare a quella perfetta per me. Anche con le cialde non ho avuto problemi anche se devo ammettere che non sono buone quanto la polvere. Accettabili, comunque! Per problemi personali non ho ancora avuto modo di provare il cappuccinatore il quale, però, per l'erogazione dell'acqua per tisane è ottimo e facilmente pulibile. Ho tarato la macchina a mezz'ora prima della sospensione e questo tempo è assolutamente sufficiente per scaldare le tazzine nel caso mi serva farlo. Ripeto però che io trovo il caffè erogato a temperatura giusta anche senza questa ulteriore accortezza. La ricomprerei e la consiglio senz'altro!",2 people found this helpful,Yes

Das geringe Gewicht der Maschine, was dazu führt, dass man sie immer sehr gut festhalten muss wenn man den Siebträger einsetzt, da sie sich sonst mit dreht.2. Der Siebträger. Dieser hat einen doppelten Boden dessen Aufbau aus einem Sieb und einem winzigen Loch darunter besteht. Diese Kombination soll dazu dienen, dass eigentlich jeder mit jedem Kaffeepulver eine ""crema"" erzeugen kann.Das liegt daran, daß sehr hoher Druck nötig ist, um den Espresso durch das Loch zu drücken. Es ersetzt somit, oder simuliert damit den Druck, der eigentlich durch das richtig gemahlene und mit einem Tamper verdichtet Kaffeepulver entstehen sollte.Daher die Empfehlung eines anderen Siebträgers mit nur einem Boden.Der Umgang damit erfordert zwar mehr Sorgfalt und Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema, aber die Ergebnisse die man damit erzielen kann, sind es definitiv wert!Bei dieser Rezension handelt es sich lediglich um meine persönliche Meinung und Erfahrung, welche nicht als in Stein gemeißelt betrachtet werden muss.Ich wünsche allen viel Spaß beim entdecken der Welt des Guten Espresso.",One person found this helpful,Yes

L'ho consigliata a chiunque per la buona qualità e ne ho acquistate due.La prima ha retto fino ad oggi, quando dopo poco più di due anni ha iniziato a sputacchiare il caffè ovunque e a tirare malissimo l'acqua, nonostante fosse stata sempre manutenuta a dovere con il giusto decalcificante e trattata con estrema cura. Mi dispiace davvero tanto dover scrivere un'opinione così, lo faccio davvero con grande difficoltà. Ero affezionatissima al prodotto, ma sono davvero delusa. Non molto dal prodotto in sé, ma dal supporto Delonghi, che dopo un sacco di tentativi, ancora non è riuscito a darmi una risposta. Per una macchina di 200 euro all'origine, non mi aspettavo un trattamento tale e soprattutto da un'azienda leader nel settore. Potrei portarla in un centro non autorizzato, ma non me la sento di spendere un 70/80/100 euro per metterla a posto, dato che i preventivi sono alti e dovrei pagare il ""danno"". Mi irrita non poter fruire della garanzia, dichiarata di 5 anni (ma in realtà di 2), per un'avaria non di certo dipesa da un cattivo utilizzo, ma dalla qualità costruttiva. Ottimo prodotto che continuo a consigliare, ma se avete un problema dimenticatevi un servizio efficace.Nemmeno altri marchi non italiani, di cui ultimamente si sta parlando per la mancata assistenza (vedesi Aicook e Create IKOHS, con i quali non ho avuto nemmeno una riga di problema), mi hanno dato un trattamento così brutto.In definitiva, prodotto buono, finché dura, ma assistenza da desiderare",One person found this helpful,Yes

Über die Lieferung möchte ich eigentlich gar keine Worte verlieren. Wie gewohnt schnell und problemlos.Verpackt war die Maschine ebenfalls sehr gut.Ich empfehle die Herausnahme aus dem Karton zu zweit vorzunehmen.Der Aufbau und die Inbetriebnahme waren dank Anleitung sehr einfach und gingen schnell über die Bühne..Mit dieser Espressomaschine bekommt man (mit etwas Übung - bei mir hat es ca. eine Woche gedauert, bis ich den Dreh raus hatte) definitiv einen sehr guten Kaffee hin.Auch die Milchdüse funktioniert einwandfrei und auch ich als Anfänger konnte damit guten Milchschaum hinbekommen. Außerdem ist sie komplett abnehmbar und somit sehr einfach zu reinigen.Was mich etwas gestört hat (Allerdings ist das in dieser Preisklasse völlig normal) ist, dass die Maschine nach dem die Schaumdüse benutzt wurde, sehr lange zum abkühlen braucht.Für alle die mit dieser Info nichts anfangen können:Teurere Maschinen haben 2 Wasserkreisläufe. Einen zum Kaffee brühen und einen zum Milchschäumen. Diese hat lediglich einen, Welcher für beide Zwecke verwendet wird. Das beutet man kann entweder Kaffee zubereiten oder die Schaumdüse nutzen. Will man Milch aufschäumen, heizt sich das Gerät auf über 100°C auf, und bläst somit Dampf aus der Düse.Für die Kaffeezubereitung ist diese Temperatur jedoch viel zu hoch und das Gerät muss, um diese Temperatur zu erreichen eben abkühlen. Und diese Zeit (wie oben erwähnt) ist ziemlich lang.Will man also mehrere Cappuccinos etc zubereiten, sollte man immer erst alle Espressi und dann erst den Milchschaum für alle zubereiten.Das Gerät an sich sieht sehr hochwertig aus und ist super verarbeitet. Den Tassenwärmer finde ich zwar überflüssig, da er kaum warm wird allerdings ist es ein nettes Gimmick, auch wenn für mich unbrauchbar.Der Wassertank rastet schön ein und ist leicht zu entnehmen.Reinigung:Dieser Punkt ist der Grund für den Abzug von zwei Sternen in der Gesamtbewertung.Im mitgelieferten Siebträger ist eine Art doppelter Boden, in dem sich Wasser und Kaffeereste sammeln. Diese sind nahezu nicht heraus zu bekommen und ich befürchte, dass es dort im laufe der Zeit gammelig wird.Schade.Auch an der Brüheinheit sollte man hin und wieder mit einem Lappen sauber machen, da es einige Stellen gibt, die nicht gereinigt werden, wenn man das Gerät lediglich durchspült.Fazit:Bekommt man die Reinigung in den Griff ist es wirklich ein super Einsteigergerät.In Kombination mit einer ordentlichen Kaffeemühle (ich habe eine Graef CM 800) kann sehr guter Kaffee zubereitet werden.",5 people found this helpful,Yes

Zusätzen kann man jedoch richtigen Espresso zubereiten. (Know-how, frisch gemahlene Bohnen und Übung erforderlich - Barista sein ist bekanntlich ein Handwerk) Ich verwende den Comandante-Grinder.Auch das aufschäumen von Milch für einen Cappuccino funktioniert nach kurzer Eingewöhnung sehr gut und reicht allemale für Latte-Art.

Sie nimmt nicht soviel Platz weg.Das programmieren ist an für sich einfach wenn man in Ruhe alles durchgeht.Den Milchschäumer habe ich noch nicht getestet, da ich zum einen ein Extragerät habe und zum anderen meinen Kaffee schwarz trinke.Geschmacklich bin ich gerade noch in der Testphase, da ich jetzt verschiedene Bohnensorten habe. Ich stelle aber jetzt schon fest, das wenn man guten Kaffee holt, der Geschmack jetzt schon deutlich besser ist als nur durch meinen Filter oder der French Press.Fazit: Für einen Anfänger der Kaffee zuhause als Genussmittel sieht, sich Zeit mitbringt um die passenden Bohnen oder auch schon gemahlenen Kaffee gefunden hat, ist die Maschine völlig ausreichend.

Kurz vor (!) Ablauf der Garantiezeit hat auch die von mir stets vorschriftsmäßig gewartete und entkalkte Maschine den Dienst verweigert.

Sie funktioniert seitdem besser als die damals als neu eingesetzte Maschine. Wenn sie jetzt noch zwei Jahre zuverlässig bleibt, hat sie ihr Geld verdient.Die Maschine produziert einen ordentlichen Espresso mit gut annehmbarer Crema. Die Qualität hängt natürlich auch vom Wasser, dem verwendeten Kaffee und dem Mahlgrad ab, doch nach etwas Ausprobieren haben wir uns zusammengerauft. Einen Stern ziehe ich ab, weil die Maschine nicht besonders schnell ist und recht laut rappelt, was allerdings am Deckel des Wassertanks liegt, der leider nicht fixiert ist und stark vibriert.Für unseren kleinen Haushalt mit nur gelegentlichem Besuch, vollkommen okay - erst recht für unter 140 €",2 people found this helpful,Yes

   Edit: bei der zweiten Lieferung war alles super. Espresso fließt gleichmäßig durch und schmeckt richtig gut. Also keine Scheu beim ersten Reinfall eine weitere Ersatzlieferung zu bestellen.____Maschine ausgepackt, angeschlossen und nach Anleitung in Betrieb genommen. Mit selbst gemahlenem Espressopulver im Sieb auf Start gedrückt und kein Ergebnis bekommen. Die Maschine baut keinen Druck auf und der Espresso tropft sehr langsam in das Glas.

Der Plastik-Tamper/Löffel ist in der Tat Murks und gehört ausgetauscht - das Einersieb lässt sich allgemein schlecht tampern und die Crema-Siebe sind allgemein betrachtet keine Offenbahrung, aber für den Einstieg total in Ordnung.Leider fällt das 2er-Sieb beim Ausklopfen bei mir fast immer mit in den Behälter - das ist schade.Auch ist der ""Puck"" am Ende häufig noch recht feucht - das liegt aber möglicherweise begründet in den Sieben.Eine Kleinigkeit ist mir noch am Wassertank aufgefallen - dieser ist bei mir offenbar nicht ganz dicht, zumindest tropft er beim befüllen unter dem Wasserhahn aus dem ""rechten"" Auslauf... da dichtet die mechanische Feder offenbar nicht richtig ab. Wenn der Tank dann in der Maschine steht tropft nichts mehr.""Tuning"" in Hinblick auf die Siebe oder auch umgebaute Siebträger (z.b. bodenlose) findet man im Netz an mehreren Stellen - da kann man also noch etwas mehr aus der Maschine rausholen wenn man mag.Ich werde bei Zeiten auch auf einen bodenlosen Siebträger umschwenken und mal schauen wie der sich so schlägt.in der Summe komme ich dennoch auf gute 4 von 5 Sternen - einfach weil die Maschine sehr unkompliziert in der Bedienung ist und bereits in kürzester Zeit mit guten Ergebnissen in der Tasse überzeugt.",One person found this helpful,Yes

Ottima cosa!Il caffé prodotto è bello cremoso, ma ovviamente questo dipende molto dal caffé utilizzato.Per le cialde ho utilizzato le Illy trovandomi decisamente bene.",N/A,Yes

   Macchina acquistata 2 anni fa. La utilizzo tutti giorni ed in modo intenso. Il caffè, una volta trovata la macinatura giusta,esce davvero gustoso.●È una macchina per caffè espresso manuale con pompa vibrante, che si caratterizza per la praticità d’utilizzo e per la versatilità.●Il prodotto presenta un pannello di controllo dal quale richiamare le funzioni, corpo con parti in plastica e prevalentemente in acciaio oltre ad un serbatoio capiente 1 litro. Il modello nero davvero stilosa.●Particolarità di questo modello, dotato anche di scalda tazze passivo e di vassoio raccogli gocce con indicatore, è il ridotto ingombro: le misure sono pari a 33 x 14,9 x 30,3 centimetri e ciò permette una facile collocazione anche sui piani di lavoro ristretti.●La macchina può essere utilizzata per la preparazione del caffè espresso a partire da polvere o cialde, oltre al cappuccino, grazie alla lancia per il vapore in dotazione.

Ich komme von einer Gaggia Classic, bei der noch alles manuell ablief. Diese deLonghi ist in vielerlei Hinsicht mit ihren Einstellmöglichkeiten und Automatismen eine Verbesserung. Man muß sich aber schon an den gewünschten Geschmack herantasten und bei Menge sowie Mahlgrad des Kaffees, Stopfung und Wassermenge ein wenig herumprobieren. Mir gefällt das, was jetzt herauskommt.Ich habe auch die verschiedentlich angepriesenen Graef-Siebe ausprobiert, um eine ""bessere"" Crema zu erhalten. Tja, man muß feiner mahlen und stärker stopfen, um das zu erreichen. Dafür wird die Maschine stärker belastet und man hat - wegen der größeren Öffnungen des Siebes - mehr Trub im Espresso. Schmeckt dann natürlich intensiver. Ich bin aber eher auf die Espresso-Flüssigkeit aus und nicht auf den Schaum. Jedenfalls bin ich zum mitgelieferten Sieb zurückgekehrt - mir genügt das.Nachteile/Probleme? Die Tasse wandert während der Zubereitung und die Einstellung der Wassermenge wird nicht lange gehalten (die muss man dann neu einstellen). Die Beschichtung des Siebträgers löst sich schon ... ich hoffe, dass das Material darunter stabil ist. Das sind aber Kleinigkeiten.Deshalb 5 Sterne.Ergänzung nach 9 Monaten:Der Siebträger arbeitet sich beim Brühen aus der Halterung heraus. Ist mir 2x passiert.

Ich kann sowohl hervorragenden Espresso, als auch Cappuccino mit Milch und Hafermilch herstellen. Der Geschmack hängt natürlich davon ab, welches Kaffeepulver man verwendet, ob es frisch gemahlen ist, ob die Menge stimmt, wie das Wasser beschaffen ist, ob der Malgrad stimmt und ob das  Kaffemehl mit dem Tempel richtig fest gedrückt wurde.

Baristas werden ihre reine Freude mit dieser kleinen Basic-Maschine haben. Es braucht etwas Übung und Experimentieren bis man für sich alles optimal einstellt.

Man kann ihn nicht als unbrauchbar bezeichnen, da man mit etwas Übung und Experimentieren doch noch einen soliden Schaum hin bekommt, jedoch gut ist die Düse nicht wirklich. Für Barista ist es eine Sache von Minuten um den Dreh bei der Dampfdüse heraus zu bekommen. Für Anfänger wird es etwas länger dauern und einige Sauereien verursachen.Für alle die keine Zeit und Lust haben sich mit der Maschine oder der Kunst des Kaffeemachens zu beschäftigen, rate ich zu einem Vollautomaten. Diese Maschine ist bis auf die Programmierbarkeit so Manuell, wie es nur sein kann.Schon wegen des Preis-/Leistungs-Verhältnisses und dem kompakten und stylischem Design und der Tatsache,, dass man gute Espresso-Qualität erreichen kann, muss ich das Produkt mit 5 Sternen beurteilen, da diese Maschine in seiner Klasse wirklich zu empfehlen ist.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

Fácil de usar (aunque hay que cogerle el truco) y café muy rico si usas buen producto con el molido correcto (fino).La recomiendo aunque destacaría un par de puntos que pueden llevar a confusión y que sería bueno que el fabricante lo incluyera en FAQ para mayor claridad:- Los filtros traen dos partes, tirando de la pestaña se pueden separar para limpiarlos. Uno de los filtros traía un film de embalaje y no salía café hasta que me di cuenta de que se podían separar. No entiendo muy bien por qué lo traía uno y el otro no.- La espumadora es recomendable abrirla 10 o 15 segundos poniendo otro recipiente antes de poner la leche para que salga vapor con potencia y no se agüe.- Al usar la espumadora de leche la cafetera se calienta y no te deja hacer otro café. Se enfría en unos segundos si apagas la función de vapor (dándole al botón de la derecha si está encendido) y abriendo la llave hasta que deja de salir vapor. He visto varios comentarios sobre esto y creo que es una duda común al principio.Comprada hace 5 meses, hacemos 4 o 5 cafés al día y por ahora no ha dado ningún problema.",One person found this helpful,Yes

War schon nicht übel. Dann auf meine erste Delonghi (keine Ahnung, welcher Typ). Beide hauchten nach ca. 3-4 Jahren ihr Leben aus, was bei meinem Kaffeeverbrauch und dem jeweiligen Preis für mich in Ordnung ist. Reparatur mag ökologisch nachhaltiger sein, in finanzieller Hinsicht jedoch nicht interessant.Nun also, seit kurz nach Weihnachten '18 die EC685.BK. Ein einfacher Siebträger mit Aufschaumdüse (die ich noch bei keinem Gerät verwendet habe) und mehr Elektronik als ich sie bei einer recht einfachen Maschine erwartet hätte.Vor dem ersten Start habe ich die Wasserhärte und die Getränketemperatur eingestellt und los ging's. Wie erwartet macht die Delonghi eine angenehme Crema. Der Kaffee/Espresso schmeckt gut (ich verwende seit Jahren den schwarzen Lavazza, am Wochenende verschiedene andere Sorten), kaum Bitternoten festzustellen. Auch die Säure hält sich, bei allen Sorten, im (v)erträglichen Rahmen.Die beiden voreingestellten Getränkemengen gefallen mir nicht so richtig, da würde ich mir noch eine weitere Einstellmöglichkeit in der Elektronik wünschen. Nicht jeder hat die gleiche Tassengröße. Doch das ist durchaus verschmerzbar.Davon abgesehen ist das Maschinchen, wie ich mir eine Espressomaschine wünsche. Einfach aufgebaut und somit leicht zu reinigen. Ohne für mich unnötigen Schnickschnack wie einen automatischen Milchschaumbereiter. Sie macht einen sehr ordentlichen Kaffee.",One person found this helpful,Yes

Die Crema ist wirklich ansprechend.Funktioniert natürlich nur mit dem richtigen Kaffee.Neben Espresso kann die Maschine auch Milchschaum.Fazit nach etwa 12 Monaten:Die Espressomaschine verrichtet seit 12 Monaten reibungsfrei ihren Dienst. Bisher konnte ich keine auftretenden Schwächen feststellen. Das beheizen der Tassenabstellfläche funktioniert nach wie vor einwandfrei und man kann nach dem Aufheizvorgang Kaffee aus angenehm temperierten Tassen genießen.Die Bedienung ist intuitiv und die Tasten haben einen angenehmen Druckpunkt. Für das Einleiten des Reinigungsvorgangs muss ich zwar immer wieder in die Bedienungsanleitung schauen, da der Vorgang eine bestimmte Tastenkombination als Initation benötigt. Die Reinigung startet danach aber selbstständig und läuft ohne weiteres Zutun von allein bis zum Ende.Wenn man die Maschine regelmäßig (gemäß Anzeige der beleuchteten Knöpfe) durchführt, hat man auch eine lange Zeit Spaß mit der Maschine. Die notwendige Reinigung wird durch oranges Aufleuchten der rechten Taste angezeigt.Druck und Durchlaufgeschwindigkeit der Maschine fühlen sich auch nach 12 Monaten noch an wie neu.Der Siebträger, welcher aus Edelstahl besteht, zeigt keine Gebrauchsspuren (wenn man ihn regelmäßig reinigt).Es hat sich mit der Zeit herauskristallisiert, dass die Benutzung des großen Siebeinsatzes für zwei Espresso sich am besten eignet, um normalen Kaffe damit zuzubereiten.Für Espresso reicht auch das kleinere Sieb aus.Es weiterhin hervorzuheben, dass die Maschine indiviuell programmierbar ist. Dabei können Durchlaufmenge (Tassengröße/ Kaffeemenge), sowie Ausgabetemperatur eingestellt werden. Entsrpechend ist für jeden ""Temperaturgeschmack"" etwas dabei.Das Erhitzen von Wasser oder Milch mit der rechtsseitig montierten Milchschaumdüse funktioniert einwandfrei. Eine automatische Abschaltung bei Erreichen einer bestimmten Temperatur ist jedoch nicht vorhanden.Mit dem selben Bauteil kann auch Milchschaum hergestellt werden. Wenn man dafür die richtige Milch (am besten keine fettarme Milch, eher 3,5% oder mehr) verwendet, kann man mit etwas Übung stabilen Milchschaum herstellen.Dank der Möglichkeit Milchschaum herzustellen und unterschiedliche Kaffeemengen auszuwählen kann man mit ein wenig Übung schmackhafte und ansehnliche Latte Macchiato, Cappucini oder Milchkaffees zubereiten.FAZIT:Eine super Maschine für Einsteiger, da man nicht mit diversen Funktionen überfordert wird. Die Maschine könnte aber auch für Hobbybarista geeignet sein, da sie mit einfacher Handhabung und gleichbelibend gutem Kaffeegeschmack überzeugen kann.Absolute Kaufempfehlung, vorallem für den überschaubaren Preis.

Uns war von Anfang an klar, dass es eine Siebträgermaschine werden soll, damit genug Druck aufgebaut wird, um einen guten Espresso machen zu können. Auch eine Milchschaumdüse für meinen Cappuccino wollten wir haben. Gleichzeitig wollten wir aber keinen (teuren) Vollautomat, sondern ein günstiges Modell.Mittlerweile haben wir die Kaffeemaschine 2 Monate, ich kann also noch nichts zur langfristigen Haltbarkeit sagen, die manche bemängeln. Die Kaffeemaschine war bisher täglich auch öfters im Gebrauch und lässt noch keine Ermüdungserscheinungen erkennen.Der Gebrauch ist - zumindest für Espresso - einfacher als gedacht. Wasser einfüllen, einschalten, warten bis es nicht mehr blinkt, 1 Kaffeelöffel (liegt bei) Kaffeepulver in das Förmchen, mit Gefühl festdrücken, einrasten lassen, Knöpfchen drücken, und nach wenigen Augenblicken genießen.Geschmacklich ist mein (italienischer!) Freund angetan, denn die Maschine macht einen guten Kaffee (wir schwören auf Lavazza).Es gibt auch einen Einsatz für Kaffeepads.Der Cappuccino ist etwas komplizierter und es dauerte etwas, bis ich den Dreh raus hatte. Hier wäre ein Vollautomat einfacher, andererseits benötigt der mehr Einsatz beim Putzen (Milchschaumdüse, Schlauch etc.). Man drückt auf die Taste für heißes Wasser, dreht einen Knopf auf ""Dampf"", lässt etwas Wasser ab, stellt dann seine Tasse mit Milch darunter, taucht die Düse (aus der Dampf kommt) ein und zieht die Tasse langsam nach unten, sodass man von unten nach oben aufschäumt. Nach etwa einer Minute, wenn die Milch durch die Prozedur warm geworden ist, ist der Schaum fertig und hat auch eine tolle Cappuccino-Konsistenz. Nun muss man die Tasse für Kaffee drücken, das Dampfventil nochmal öffnen (natürlich mit einer anderen Tasse drunter), warten bis kein Dampf mehr kommt sondern Wasser ausfließt, und dann ist die Brühgruppe genug abgekühlt dass nun der Espresso für den Cappuccino zubereitet werden kann.Es ist auch möglich, zwei Tassen gleichzeitig zu befüllen, hierfür gibt es einen separaten Einsatz und eine separate Taste. Für zwei Espressotassen funktioniert das gut, für eine Espresso- und eine Cappuccinotasse muss man etwas jonglieren, es funktioniert aber auch.Da wir bisher noch keinen Mangel feststellen konnten, gebe ich gerne 5 Sterne.",N/A,Yes

Das kann man in dieser Preiskategorie aber auch nicht erwarten.Wir haben diese Maschine selber im täglichen Betrieb und mittlerweile auch schon ein zweites Gerät an Bekannte verschenkt. Sie ist sehr einfach zu handhaben und macht einen sehr guten Espresso. Dazu mahlen wir die Bohnen frisch. Der Milchaufschäumer ist eine positive Überraschung gewesen. Er funktioniert für einen Aufschäumer mit niedrigem Druck sehr gut, und der Milchschaum für den Cappuccino kann sich mit dem von einem Gastronomiegerät durchaus vergleichen lassen. Nach ein bisschen Übung bekommt man zuverlässig guten Milchschaum. Dazu verwenden wir 3,8%ige frische Vollmilch direkt aus dem Kühlschrank.Wichtig ist natürlich die Reinigung. Wir säubern die abnehmbaren Teile der Milchdüse direkt nach jeder Verwendung. Der Siebträger selber, bleibt meistens einfach eingespannt und wir vor der nächsten Nutzung ausgeleert. Alle paar Tage wird auch dieser unter dem Wasserhahn abgespült.

Um die eigentliche Verpackung war kein weiterer Umkarton, was ich eigentlich gut finde, denn warum muss um einen bereits stabilen Karton ein weiterer gepackt  werden.Die Maschine ist optisch und von der Materialwertigleit sehr ansprechend. Sie wurde geliefert mit drei Sieben und einem Kaffeeportionierer/Tamper. Ein Milchkännchen war nicht dabei, habe ich separat bestellt.Die DeLonghi ist einfach zu bedienen und läßt sich programmieren, was in der Anleitung gut erklärt wird.Das Wasser heizt sehr schnell auf, sodass die Maschine schnell einsatzklar ist. Habe mir auf Youtube Videos zur richtigen Zubereitung von Cappuccino angesehen, den ich überwiegend mit dieser Maschine zubereite. Man erhält hilfreiche kleine Tipps, die die Zubereitung perfektionieren und das Getränk noch leckerer machen.Das Gerät bereitet je nach Kaffeepulver einen wirklich hervorragenden Cappuccino. Der hierzu erforderlich Milchaufschäumer macht dabei eine schöne Milchcreme. Habe mir auch eine Auswahl an ESE Pads bestellt, die in dem separaten Sieb angewendet werden und die Arbeit natürlich erleichtern. Hatte auch noch ""normale"" Pads aus meiner vorherigen Kaffemaschine, die auch funktioneren, aber leider geschmacklich nicht heranreichen.Die Maschine läßt sich sehr leicht sauberhalten.Was mir nicht gefällt, ist die fehlenede Siebarretierung beim Ausschlagen des Siebs, welches mir dadurch regelmäßig in den Mülleimer fliegt. Einige Rezensenten schildern, dass die Maschine zu wenig Druck aufbaut und das Wasser nicht mehr durch den Kaffee dringt. Mir ist dabei aufgefallen, dass dieses Phänomen auftreten kann, wenn man das Sieb für zwei Tassen verwendet und den Kaffee nur etwas zu stark mit dem Tamper komprimiert, dann dringt das Wasser kaum noch durch. Das halte ich aber nicht für ein Problem des Druckaufbaus, sondern eher ein ""Anwenderfehler"". Man darf den Kaffe nicht zu stark anpressen.Insgesamt bin ich aber bisher mit der Maschine sowohl in der Anwendung, als auch vom Geschmack her sehr zufrieden.

Wenn das Pulver zu fein ist, schafft die Pumpe es nicht.- Mit Füllhöhe vom Kaffeepulver experimentieren. Zu wenig und es bleibt Wasser im Siebträger (Sauerei), zu viel und das Pulver wird zu dicht.- Da die Pumpe wohl nicht die stärkste ist, scheint es besser zu gehen, zwei einzelne Kaffee zu ziehen, statt einen mit dem Doppel-Sieb.",N/A,Yes

And that's the whole trick about this machine: it WILL make excellent coffee, IF you get the coffee grind right, otherwise your coffee will either come out too watery or not come out at all.The good:- Warms up very fast and can maintain the temperature during the brew - essential for getting the aroma out of the coffee.- The machine does not add variables to the coffee making process, so it is easy to make excellent coffee consistently, after you know how to grind your coffee, how much to put in and how hard to tap it.- All machine components through which coffee flows are exposed, so it is very easy to rinse/clean them immediately after use. This will prevent the build-up of coffee residue in places you don't see or can't reach, altering the taste of coffee (and possibly making it unhealthy for consumption).- The milk frother is an excellent improvement from the previous model (EC 680), and makes nice foam. But, just like with the coffee, you need to have the right milk at the right temperature to obtain a thick foam. If you just took skimmed milk out of the fridge and expect to get barista-style cappuccino, you're in for a disappointment, and it's not the machine's fault.- The programming! Ahhh how I love it, being able to set the machine for exactly the size of our espresso cups!- The two leveled cup holder is very useful.- Super compact eye candy! More room on the kitchen counter! Yey!The bad:- You see that mirror-finished stainless steel plate where you put the cup? Admire it as much as you want when you unpack the espresso machine, because that will be the last time you see it scratch-free. It's pretty normal for the machine to slightly vibrate in use and make the cup ""dance"" a bit on top of the plate. Cup bottoms are a bit rough, they will inadvertently ruin the finish. Get used to the idea, it's fine. The machine still looks great.- Obviously the plastic coffee tamper in the box is there just so that nobody can complain there isn't one in the box. Feel free to toss it away, and get yourself a decent, fitting, stainless steel tamper, whose own weight will be enough to press the coffee just right.The ugly:- The plastic handle contains a cyllinder of solid metal for the sole purpose that it... feels heavier, and somehow people would associate that with higher quality. No idea what the manufacturer was thinking, but that is just garbage. Take off the silver cap at the end, slide that useless weight out and send it to recycling, then put the cap back on. There. See? Still makes excellent coffee.

Das war einer der Gründe, eine DeLonghi-Maschine zu kaufen, da ich früher damit gute Erfahrungen gemacht habe.Die Bedienungsfreundlichkeit ist eher mäßig, aber man gewöhnt sich daran, viel falsch machen kann man auch nicht und für den Preis kann man jetzt auch kein Supervollautomaten erwarten.Was man aber erwarten können sollte: Das die Maschine nicht nach 7-8 Monaten mehr oder weniger ihren Geist aufgibt. Wie schon in einigen Rezessionen geschrieben: die Maschine schafft es nach dieser Zeit nicht mehr, genug Druck aufzubauen, um genügend Wasser durch die Maschine laufen bzw. pressen zu lassen. Trotz regelmäßiger Entkalkung und Reinigung nach JEDEM Durchlauf. Selbst ein neuer Siebträger brachte keine Besserung. Am Schluss musste man 3 mal hintereinander auf die Taste für 2 Espresso drücken, um wenigstens einen halben Espresso erhalten. Das geht gar nicht.Was aber noch viel schlimmer ist: Auf 3 Anfragen reagierte DeLonghi bis heute gar nicht. Anscheinend interessieren die sich für ihre Kunden überhaupt nicht.Fazit: Ich würde im Augenblick keine Produkte von DeLonghi mehr kaufen, wenn jemand so gar nicht auf Kunden reagiert.

Preparación del café: la colocación de la cazoleta en el brazo es muy sencilla y tiene un buen ajuste. Va a presión y hace ""clac"" cuando la insertas. Gracias a la cuchara de plástico que viene con la caferera es muy fácil tener la cantidad de café exacta: una única porción(son unos 7g) para un café y 2 porciones para la cazoleta grande de 2 cafés. La misma cuchara sirve para prensar el café y esto es importante: un exceso de prensado hará que no salga café o que salga muy poco. Hay que prensar con poca fuerza hasta que notemos que ya hace falta incrementar más la fuerza de prensado, y ahí paramos.2. Haciendo café: colocar el brazo y apretarlo es bastante fácil porque está marcado el punto de inicio y fin de giro y además el tacto es buenísimo para notar si lo estás haciendo bien. Parece una tontería pero en algunas cafeteras de brazo no da mucha seguridad esto que comento. Si no sale nada de café es porque el agujerito que hay debajo de la cazoleta está embozado. Es complicado que pase porque ese agujero no está en contacto con el café molido pero si se cuela algún granito de café cuando lo estás limpiando se puede obstruir y no sale nada de café.Otro consejo: si notáis que cuesta girar es porque os habéis pasado de cantidad de café. Esto ocurre con más frecuencia cuando se usa la cazoleta de 2 cafés aunque se use la cuchara medidora para llenarla. Por muy poco puede darse el caso de que entre muy apretado el brazo y luego no salga café o salga poco.3. Usando el capuccinatore: Consejo: yo suelo hacer primero el café y luego cambio al modo de capuccino para espumar la leche, de esa forma no tarda nada de tiempo en calentarse y poder usar esa función. Pero si lo haces al revés, y esto es de lo que mucha gente se queja, luego tarda mucho en enfriarse la función café. Eso es así para evitar que te hagas un café quemado. En este punto tienes 2 opciones: 1. apagas y enciendes la cafetera2. En el modo café (no en el de vapor), abres el grifillo para tirar vapor y dejas que actúe unos segundos. Tirará vapor y luego agua, y ahí cortas. En unos segundos los botones de hacer café dejarán de parpadear porque habrás enfriado la máquina. Esto no es una solución casera, está explicado en el manual, pero la gente no lee el manual. Otro consejo: el mando de accionamiento del vapor no tiene un recorrido de 90°, son más de 90° así que asegúrate bien de que está abierto ""a tope"" cuando lo uses o funcionará unos segundos y luego no irá y pensarás que va mal.otro consejo: veréis algunos comentarios de gente que dice que sale agua alrededor del botón de encendido y que está defectuosa y la han cambiado. Decir que eso sólo pasa si no colocas bien el depósito de agua. Hay que insertarlo desde arriba y hacer un poco de fuerza y que haga ""clac"" para asegurarse que se ha encajado bien. Si no lo haces bien es cuando va filtrando agua por debajo y empieza a salir por el botón de encendido.A raíz de comentarios sobre la baja temperatura de los cafés: se puede regular (baja - media - alta) la temperatura del café así como la cantidad. Hay que leerse el manual, para eso está!!A día de hoy me funciona todo perfectamente y después de leer opiniones malas puedo decir que la mayoría son por un mal uso o por no leerse el manual. Por su puesto que habrá alguna con algún defecto pero por estadística es normal visto lo visto de unidades vendidas.Edito 8 meses después: sigue funcionando perfecta, muy contento.

Venía de una Saeco Poemia que era cargar y listo para hacer un buen café, pero la pobre se nos murió. Compré está viendo que la ponen muy bien...y me ha tocado la ficha negra. :(Sacada de la caja su estado aparente es inmaculado, pero dado que no quiero pagar liebre por gato y vista la tendencia que tiene cierta tienda en cascarte productos devueltos o averiados como nuevos, siempre reviso. Una revisión no demasiado minuciosa revela unos cuantos detalles inquietantes:1) El depósito de agua presenta claros signos de haber sido utilizado con anterioridad. Unos pequeños residuos de cal donde quedaron pequeñas gotas que se escaparon al secado y allí se secaron.2) En las válvulas que tiene el depósito abajo, quedan restos de gotas de agua, esta vez no seca sino mojada. Ajá! La trama se enreda. :)3) El mismo depósito tiene un rayajo visible de unos 5 cm de largo a lo largo de la parte exterior que acopla en la máquina. Otros rayajos más pequeños. Nada del otro mundo si no fuera porque un pequeño pase de la linterna del móvil revela muchos más rayajos. Generalmente, una buena dosis de luz blanca LED revela en plásticos estás cosas, y si es nuevo es nuevo. Este depósito había sido usado con anterioridad claramente. No procedo a inspeccionar el resto de la máquina porque tengo claro que al haber sido usada y devuelta, en caso de que funcione perfectamente, que pasa, me la quedo sí obviamente Amazon me la vende como producto usado y no nuevo. Si no lo hiciera, se la devolvía ipso facto. Pero no se da este caso de quedarse y aceptar una compensación por producto usado vendido como nuevo porque...4) Ay los Bares, los Bares de presión! Personalmente, he pasado por unos cuantos bares, restaurantes, clubs, pubs, cafeterías y demás antros en 20 años en la profesión. Conste que adoro el café pero no soy un hipster sibarita y pejigatero que busca el summum por poco precio, me amoldo a lo que hay y por 160 pavos más le vale a esta Delonghi Dedica hacerme un café cojonudo. He tocado todo tipo de cafeteras y máquinas de forma consistente y repetible. He hecho y servido millones y millones de cafés, y si bien no puedo decir que absolutamente todos hayan sido buenos porque siempre te sale alguno rana cada X tiempo, sí que diría que el 99.9% por ciento han sido buenos en base a su extracción y cremita. Hasta el bar más cochambroso en el que trabajé tenia una cafetera italiana con la que no hay que ser muy mañoso y meticuloso para que te salga un café bueno, y sin despeinarte, es muy sencillo sacar un café ESPECTACULAR con la crema color avellana y oro más fragante con tocar un poco presión, temperatura y molinillo. Nada de estar horas y horas, un par de toques, un par de cargas de prueba y ajustas. Y si ya te pones a tocar haces café nivel DIOS. Con una cafetera decente haces buen café sin arrancarte la cabeza en un periquete. Hasta el más manco es capaz de hacer uno nivel DIOS en estas.Sí bien estás tienen más presión, sus bombas y calderas son muy psche. Sé que es posible en máquinas más humildes sacar un café bueno, visto mi Saeco Poemia, otras más alta gama que he usado, y otra anterior que tuve. Mismos 15 bares de presión que la Delonghi Dedica, solamente atmosférica, nada de ese farfollo de presurizado y tal. Cargar sin mirar el grano, prensar, apretar, girar la manivela y listo. No espero sacar uno igual que con una buena cafetera italiana de bar, pero visto los resultados de mi Saeco Poemia con un café nivel DIOS que yo mismo he preparado, sí que puedo decir que estás llegan fácil y consistentemente a nivel Apóstol y Angel.MI UNIDAD DELONGHI DEDICA USADA LOS UNICOS 15 BARES QUE HA VISTO EN SU VIDA SON LOS 15 BARES QUE SE HA RECORRIDO BEBIENDO CUBATAS ANTES DE LLEGAR A MÍ, PORQUE ESOS 15 BARES ESTÁN FLOJOS, FLOJOS, FLOJOS.Ha durado lo que viene a ser 7 cafés. Dos reguleros con muy poca crema que se diluye enseguida fueron los primeros. Viniendo prevenido de antemano por algunos comentarios hablando de lo pejigatera que puede llegar a ser esta máquina, me dispongo a experimentar con la molienda y tal, más gruesa, más fina, etc. En el momento en que con una carga no muy fina y más bien corta se ahoga y no pasa me digo uuuy, esto no me gusta un pelo. 2 cargas después estoy con la ostia de canto y sacando la italiana que tengo que sí bien está regulera, sigue haciendo buen café sin crema años y años. 2 cargas más mientras espero que se haga el café en la italiana y oiga, que no, que esto no va. Y nadie juega conmigo y mi café, y menos a las 7 de la mañana recién despierto. Y una italiana de 20 pavos le da sopas con honda a un supuestamente buen producto que me ha llegado averiado...o puede que sea así, inconsistente y pejigatero cuando por su precio y simplicidad debería hacer el mejor café que pueda con el menor esfuerzo, pues como que no!Con lo cual, una decepción considerable. Se va de vuelta a Amazon con todo mi odio por tenerme 20 minutos zombie perdido esta mañana, y sirva mi aviso para navegantes:El propósito de estas cafeteras es el hacer un café decente o bueno sin complicarse la vida. En el momento que no cumple esa función, es un producto que no da lo que promete. En mi caso creo que es la bomba, que más que bomba es petardo de lo mala que es, así que asumo que está averiada y por eso se devolvió anteriormente a nuestro fatídico desencuentro. No dudo que sea un buen producto visto las revisiones de Amazon, pero si además de que aún funcionando es finolis, directamente no funciona, tengo por seguro que no voy a repetir.Para experimentos y llegar al café supremo del universo tengo la cafetera del bar que me hace café hasta haciendo el pino puente mientras bailo desnudo y sin mirar. Esta sirve para filtrar un poco de agua por café...hasta que deja de hacerlo. :)Un saludo.",125 people found this helpful,Yes

Innanzitutto GRANDE AMAZON! La politica e l'efficienza dei resi è una grande garanzia per il consumatore! Impossibile rimanere delusi! AMAZON impeccabile, complimenti! Passiamo alla macchinetta. Non ho capito se fosse difettosa o se fosse proprio scadente di per sé. In sostanza il caffè usciva acquoso, come in una moka! Inaccettabile! Ho provato diverse macinature, dosaggi e pressioni. Niente. Praticamente l'acqua usciva con una pressione a mio avviso del tutto insufficiente a produrre un espresso. Se esercitavi sul caffè in polvere una pressione un tantino più decisa l'acqua poi non riusciva a passare! Clamoroso! Stessa cosa se macinavi un po' più finemente il caffè! Inaccettabile! E guai a riempire il misurino! L'acqua proprio non riusciva  a passare attraverso il caffé! Solo se usavi una macinatura più grossolana, non pressavi troppo e non riempivi troppo il misurino, allora il caffè usciva, ma acquoso come una moka! Ho provato a fare uscire l'acqua senza caffè: praticamente faceva qualche timido spruzzo di vapore, il resto acqua a fontanella, con poca pressione! Mah! Eppure il cappuccinatore funzionava, riusciva ad andare in pressione e a fare la crema di latte! Mah!In ogni caso il sistema di controllo era scomodissimo, solo tre pulsanti, per regolare tutto il resto dovevi premere determinate combinazioni di tasti con diversa durata della pressione e in diversa sequenza! Una roba scomodissima e allucinante, non capivo mai se stessi facendo la cosa giusta! Gli unici riferimenti erano le luci lampeggianti o fisse dei pulsanti; secondo il costruttore avrei dovuto distinguere i messaggi luminosi in base al modo in cui lampeggiavano e alle combinazioni di pulsanti accesi! Ovviamente impossibile, ogni volta dovevo prendere il manuale, e anche col manuale era difficile capire il messaggio! Ho imparato due cose: mai fidarsi delle recensioni e mai più macchinette con controlli automatizzati, la prossima la prendo totalmente manuale ed analogica!

Si possono usare cialde (in cotone) o caffè macinato in porzione singola o doppia a seconda dell'accessorio montato. Il corpo è in metallo e la parte superiore con piano portatazzine è scaldata. I miei consigli sono:-usate caffè di qualità (la differenza si sente tutta)-usate acqua minerale-prima di fare il caffè fate scorrere una tazzina di acqua calda dal gruppo erogatore perche essendo in metallo (quindi freddo) tende a raffreddare molto il primo caffè che esce mentre il secondo sarà già a temperatura. Se prendete questa macchina per metterla affiancata ad una superficie considerate che la manopola del gruppo si inserisce da sinistra poi si stringe verso il centro quindi deve avere almeno 15 cm di spazio libero su entrambi i lati. Non mettete mai in lavatrice il gruppo (portacialde) perche perde la cromatura a contatto dei detersivi e diventa opaco.Revisione: A distanza di qualche mese la pressione del vapore dall'ugello per il cappuccino è notevolmente diminuita e per fare la schiuma serve più di un minuto con l'inconveniente che il latte diventa troppo caldo e poco schiumoso.

Como me ha gustado, me he animado a comentaros mis impresiones. Espero que os sean de utilidad.1.-EL CONTENIDO DE LA CAJADentro de la caja viene lo siguiente:--La cafetera.--Medidor prensador.--Portafiltro--3 filtros--Descalcificador--Instrucciones.2.-LA CAFETERALa cafetera está fabricada en plástico y acero inoxidable. Mide aproximadamente 31x31x14 cm. En cuanto a sus elementos, la cafetera tiene un depósito de 1,3 litros de agua, un botón de encendido/apagado en la base, una bandeja anti goteo para colocar las tazas que dista aproximadamente 8 cm del portafiltros. En la parte superior presenta tres botones que nos permite regular la temperatura del café entre baja, media y alta. El portafiltros tiene dos salidas para que podamos colocar dos tazas o vasos al mismo tiempo, pero dado el tamaño de la base, si queremos hacer dos tazas, estas deberán ser pequeñas, ya que dos tazas grandes no nos van a entrar en la base. Fíjate en las fotos. En la parte superior derecha de la máquina tenemos una palanca que nos permite obtener agua caliente. El espumador de leche tiene dos posiciones, una para calentar la leche simplemente y la otra para obtener espuma, ideal para los cappuccinos. En el portafiltros podemos colocar tres tipos de filtros. Los dos primeros son para café molido, uno es para una taza de café y el  otro para dos tazas. El tercer filtro nos permitirá usar cápsulas de café. Te preguntarás si los de la marca blanca de tu supermercado valen para esta cafetera. Sólo tienes que ir al super y comprobar si en el envoltorio pone que cumplen la norma ESE (Easy Serving Espresso) En casi todos los comercios tienes estos tipos de cápsulas de marca blanca.3.-CONCLUSIONES¿Y qué nota le das? ¿Me lo recomiendas?Estas dos preguntas son las que todos nos hacemos cuando compramos cualquier dispositivo, y la respuesta es siempre la misma: DEPENDE DE PARA QUÉ LO USES Y CUÁLES SEAN TUS EXPECTATIVAS. Se trata de una cafetera de bomba de tamaño muy contenido. La calidad y los acabados son buenos. Nos permite usar café molido y cápsulas.  Para el precio que tiene, está bastante bien. Te pongo a continuación cuáles son sus puntos fuertes y débiles para ayudarte a decidir.PUNTOS FUERTES:--Artículo con buenos acabados.--Uso de café molido o en cápsulas.--Compatible con varias marcas de café en cápsulas. Norma E.S.E.--Espumador de leche.--Gran depósito de agua.--Aviso para descalcificar la cafetera.--Tamaño contenido.--En unos pocos días lo tienes en casa y con la garantía que da Amazon.PUNTOS DÉBILES:--En el caso de hacer dos tazas al mismo tiempo, tienen que ser pequeñas, no entran dos medianas o grandes en la base.--Sólo entran cómodamente tazas de hasta 8 cm de altura.--Los 15 bares de presión se te pueden quedar cortos para hacer espuma. Si necesitas más presión deberás aumentar el presupuesto.--El precio.",558 people found this helpful,Yes

Premetto che veniamo da una macchinetta a capsule dolce gusto (preferita con capsule bar) e devo dire che dopo alcune prove con vari caffé, la De'Longhi risulta di gran lunga migliore quando utilizzata con Kimbo Espresso Napoletano. il Caffé se fatto con questa miscela, ristretto e abbondando col macinato, viene più denso che al bar. Se fatto non ristretto viene buono e corposo. Va detto che almeno nel nostro caso viene meglio se si utilizza il filtro per due tazze rispetto al filtro per una. Anche la mia compagna che è molto esigente ha apprezzato la nuova arrivata. La macchina è sicuramente meno pratica di una con capsule, ma dà molta più soddisfazione. La consigliamo a chi ha voglia di confrontarsi con un minimo di sbattimenti (dosa il caffé, pigia, pulisci la macchina) per ottenere un risultato notevole.Spero di provarla presto con altre marche tipo Passalacqua e Pellini.Aggiornamento dopo anni di utilizzo.

Nach tausend Versuchen ging sie wieder. Nach zwei Wochen wieder nicht. Nirgendwo eine Antwort, die ""technische Beratung"" bei Amazon hatte auch keine Ahnung. Ich wollte schon zurückschicken.Aber dann fand ich die völlig einfachen Lösungen:1. Möglichkeit: WassertankSteht schon in der Bedienungsanleitung (liest halt niemand): bei längerem Betrieb kann sich der Wassertank durch Vibrationen irgendwann aus den Ventilen heben, es kommt nicht mehr genug Wasser nach, um Druck aufzubauen.Warum haben aber nur wenige Nutzer dieses Problem?Weil es nicht auftaucht, wenn man den Wassertank zum Befüllen ABNIMMT. Danach klickt man ihn ja jedesmal ein. So wird er normalerweise alle zwei bis drei Tage also neu eingerastet.Ich aber befülle mit einer Kanne und nehme den Tank deshalb nie ab... Wenn dann die Maschine einige Wochen gebrummt hat, hebt sich durch die Vibrationen so langsam der Tank um einen Milimeter aus der Rastung heraus und irgendwann schließen die Ventile und es kommt kein Druck mehr.Also alle paar Tage mal ein wenig den Tank herunterdrücken: Problem gelöst!2. Möglichkeit: SiebträgerGelegentlich fällt beim Abklopfen das Zwischensieb in die Knockbox (siehe Bild).Wer es dann (wie ich) einfach herausfischt und sofort wieder befestigt, der macht einen Fehler.Normalerweise befindet sich auf der Unterseite des Siebes nämlich nie Kaffeepulver, dies bleibt ja im Sieb zurück. Nun bringt man aber durch Faulheit Pulver unter das Sieb. Beim nächsten Brühen werden diese Reste (mit viel Druck) in das winzige Loch vom Siebträger gedrückt. Beim nächsten Mal noch mehr...Irgendwann hat man dieses Loch dann mit viel Druck so richtig verstopft, man backt sich ja regelrecht einen Verschluß. Und prompt kommt kein Espresso mehr heraus.Fällt also das Zwischensieb mal in Kaffeesatz, immer den Siebträger ausspülen und das Zwischensieb dann abgespült einsetzen. Es darf kein Pulver unter dem Zwischensieb sein.Ist der Siebträger schon verstopft: mit Spülmittel säubern.Seit ich diese beiden Dinge beherzige, hatte ich nicht einmal mehr Druckabfall - aber jeden Tag leckeren Espresso.PS: Empfehlenswert ist es, ein Mikrofasertuch fürs Abwischen der Maschine zu kaufen.

Can accommodate various size cups.6. Very small footprint. This is totally what sold it for me.7. I have successfully used several different types of beans with the unit - very happy with the results.Cons1. Tricky to use for double espresso shots. It might be just me, but if you don't get the right amount (you need less than 2 full scoops using the provided scoop), all sorts of issues follow - no flow etc. Single espresso or ese pods work perfectly everytime.Areas to improve1. A low water indicator would be nice2. A dedicated double espresso scoopThe above features can be added without a significant impact on the price and no impact to other delonghi products.One could list a whole range of improvement areas that if addressed would result in a completely different and much more expensive product (which probably already exists). So there's no point in going there.I can't say anything about the milk frother, making cappuccinos etc. as I haven't used that functionality as of yet.

This is my first experience with anything other than a fully-automated machine (I'm replacing my Nespresso due to environmental concerns over the pods). The instruction manual is brief and seems correct, but every word in it counts, so extremely close attention to every detail is required. I got better instructions from YouTube. You'll need several vessels to catch variously hot water, splatters and squirts, and a damp cloth to mop up everything that goes over the side.Here are a few tips for other complete newbies:1. First problem: the 3-pin plug doesn't go fully into my 2-plug wall outlet, which none of the other things I've plugged in have done. This means that the lights would only come on if I pressed hard on the plug to fully engage it. It works fine in the other side, so problem solved.2. Be sure to take all the bits out of the box. I've just located my 1-cup filter (tucked into the styrofoam insert) after mistakenly using the coffee pod filter for my first cup. The machine came with the 2-cup filter inserted. The attached photo shows all 3, with 2 removable rubber-ringed inserts. The filters fit tightly into the base (filter holder), held in by 3 side springs, so use some force to pull them out and push them in until they click. There is a little notch in the filter base that you can use with your fingertip to pull out the filter.3. I'm still mystified about why the 1-cup and 2-cup buttons sometimes flash 3 times rapidly, pause, and repeat. The manual shows this could be caused by 4 different things. Eventually they go on solidly.4. I'll wait until later to fiddle with the programmable settings, as I got myself into blinking-light-purgatory and had to turn the whole thing off for awhile. There are settings for coffee temperature (low-medium-high); water hardness (soft-medium-hard), which presumably affects how often the descaling reminder light comes on; and the time until the machine turns itself off (9-30-180 min). You can also programme the volume of coffee delivered, which I'll try later.Once I had managed making the first cup, it took another hour to figure out how to heat the milk.1. The manual says to press the steam button, and 'the light flashes', but it doesn't seem to do so each time I tried it; sometimes it comes on solid straight away. It is supposed to flash until it is ready to dispense steam and then go solid, so I'll have to figure out how that all works; otherwise the rest of the exercise is futile because I got a bit of hot water and then nothing else.2. There is a mystifying icon on the 'cappucino maker selection ring' which points upwards for 'hot milk' and downwards for 'cappucino'. The whole metal stem/black plastic icon ring also rotates about an eighth-turn anti-clockwise to enable you to pull the whole thing downwards and remove it for cleaning. The black plastic ring with the icons on it is meant to be pushed towards the sky for hot milk, and towards the ground for frothing, sliding up and down around the metal cylinder. I know this seems stupid to have to describe, but if I didn't understand it maybe you don't either.3. Once you finally get all the stars in alignment, you turn the steam dial (A11 on the diagram) to the steam position, and let it purge water and air into an empty vessel for a few seconds. Steam dial up, get your milk container (I use a Pyrex 1-cup measure with 100ml milk), then down again, and-- at last-- you hear a rhythmic clunking from inside (the 'thermoblock') and you'll get all the steam you need to heat up the milk and/or make it froth.4. Then you wipe the milk off the metal stem, until it's time to disassemble the entire works for cleaning for the day.Final step is to go back on Amazon to buy that 500-gram 51-mm diameter coffee tamper you apparently just must have, and you might as well go for the kit and get the thermometer for the milk and the stainless steel jug. While drinking your new environmentally-friendly, thickly-frothed, 15p-per-cup cold espresso/cappucino/still wondering what a latté is, look up more videos on YouTube!25 July update: I'm getting along much better with it, although I still get two blinking lights in bursts of 3 after I finish steaming the milk. I can get my morning cups made in about 3-4 minutes. The coffee really is delicious, much better than the Nespresso-- and I'm not even a coffee snob. I'm using a bag of beans bought from M&S for £2.50, and it tastes like hot chocolate!",24 people found this helpful,Yes

It shares some of the design and functions of that previous model. There, all comparisons end. Over the years, I have got through many espresso machines: some great - some not so great, some small - some huge. A few have been absolute monsters. One even went out in a massive explosion. None have disappointed as much as this one though.The machine is small and light. Without the heavy filter attachment, it's not really much heavier than a large box of tea bags. Seriously. I have packets of coffee that weigh no more than the main body of this machine.To understand why this is a problem, we need to look at the location of the buttons on the top. They are on a sloped part of the main body, close to the top of the machine.So you fill the heavy filter attachment and go to slot it in. It's a tight fit and the machine is too lightweight to deal with it, so the machine begins to turn on your worktop. You have to grip the machine firmly to stop it moving, but that holder is still very tight. You get it part way, but it's certainly not firmly in place. You grip the top of the machine more firmly - fingers over the side trying to gain more purchase ... and ... you accidentally hit one of the buttons and water starts pouring out, hissing and bursting out of the top of the filter attachment, because it's not firmly locked in place. The pressure wants to turn the filter back, but you grip tightly, trying to hold it in place, but it's no good. The machine is so light that it turns under the pressure and the filter is thrown out, wet coffee grounds flying in all directions.After you have cleaned everything up, you try again, this time being careful where you put your fingers. You try to put a mug under the filter but ... there's not enough space. Not enough space for a small mug or a large cup. You're going to have to use a small cup or measuring jug.But, hey ... coffee's on it's way.Hit the one cup option. You get a tiny little bit of coffee - not enough to get all that coffee goodness you have in the filter. Never mind for now ... let's use the hot milk function and drink the coffee.The hot milk function just dumps hot water into your milk. There's three times as much liquid as you started with and the 1 part milk/2 parts water mix is barely warm.You pour it into the minuscule drip of coffee and are rewarded with a cup of luke warm water, faintly flavoured with milk and coffee.Pour it away and try again.Now we wait for the machine to reset itself after using the water/steam attachment.Time passes. Lots of time passes. Several minutes pass. Finally it says it's ready for your next drink.Fill the filter. Carefully insert it. Straighten up the machine, which has revolved around 100 degrees counter clockwise.Let's try two servings.That's going better. Getting all the coffee now. OK, stop. Stop! STOOOP! It's just  adding hot water now!OK, finally stopped. Let's try Cappuccino mode on the steam attachment.Hmmm ... It's just adding loads of water to the milk again.This time, you  have slightly stronger, but more watery, barely warm coffee.As you pour it down the sink and go to leave the kitchen in disgust, your kettle looks at you and seems to whisper, ""I think you could do with a nice hot cup of tea after all that!"".You look back at the useless coffee machine you just bought and conclude that Mr Russel Hobbs may be right. about that.",10 people found this helpful,Yes

First of all it leaks water from the water tank like crazy. I've checked and checked but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with how it's placed, but it leaks water!!! You can see in the first pic.Then after you foam the milk you need to MANUALLY cool the machine and do a whole other process that is very messy for which you need at least 2 extra utensils (a cup on top of which you need to put a towel or something if you dont want  boiling water to be splashed on you!).And then the machine already has RUST! as you can see in 2 of pics, i think this is not acceptable, not even for this price band which isn't super expensive but it's not cheap either.Espresso quality:Pros: makes good coffee if you have the right coffeeCons: if the coffee is even slightly more finely grinded, it wont workFoam quality:Pros: if you manage to make it right, it produces nice foam and the overall coffee + foam is better than i've had in many place in london. Pret, Costa, Nero coffee are disgusting compared to this.Cons: if you want to make cappuccino (so bigger bubbles) then you're fine with the nozzle as it is. But if you want to make a microfoam then it wont work. I had to remove the nozzle and leave just the rubber wand that it covers because this way you have control over how deep the wand goes in the milk.",9 people found this helpful,Yes

   Had this for around 4 months & I'm wishing I'd bought something else! The product is dangerous to use as with use the filter arm rotates & comes off explosively. Scalding water & ground coffee fly every where. The only way to stop this is to hold the arm of the filter when in operation. I've already had to send the product off for repair after only 4 months of light use, which doesn't bode well for the future!Save yourself the hassle & waste of money!UpdateSo after not hearing anything from the repair service for nearly 2 months I chased them up to find that my nearly new espresso machine had been written off! DeLonghi apparently should've already sent me a new one! So another call this time to De Longhi..... And after 40 minutes of queuing and being cut off, to phoning again, queuing & being cut off I decided to email them. No response. A week later a new espresso machine got delivered by dpd without warning.Seriously.... Extremely poor customer service rubbing salt into the wound of a broken down machine.

Two weeks isn't that long in the whole scheme of things and that sort of time flies by when I'm on holiday.SEVEN. WEEKS. LATER.My coffee machine is back! Yay I'm so excited. No more trips to Cafe Nero.WRONG! The little note from the repairers says ""No issues found"" so I plug in back in again thinking maybe they have a magic touch, some special reset button was pressed that only they know about...Nope, it's still broken, in fact it appears to be worse! I can't get any steam out of the thing now.So I call up Delonghi Customer Service again, they are nice friendly people and surely they will be mortified that it's still broken especially as it's been so long at the repairs. It only takes about 45 minutes to get though and the hold music is largely just static so I was kept entertained until I finally spoke to Tom.Tom was very sad for me and he agreed that my problem wasn't good news at all so he suggested sending it back to the repairers for them to look at it again. I suggested a different solutionWhy don't you send me a new machine and I'll send the broken one back?No, says Tom, That's impossible.Why? I askBecause it might be repairable, says TomBut it never worked properly from the beginning, I sayThat's company policy, says TomAs we all know company policy is something that never be changed, can it? I mean, it feels like it could if they really wanted to but I guess Delonghi Customer Services don't want to so what can I do.After sitting in the kitchen for all of a couple of hours back it goes to the repairers to be looked at again but at least it's going to the front of the repair queue so it's not all bad.  Oh but it looks like even at the front of the queue it can take 15 days to do what I did in 15 minutes, bad times.Hopefully one day I'll be able to use this machine again or maybe it'll be one if it's little brothers or sisters as this one is clearly BROKEN.

It’s HEAVY so not easy to drag on a worktop so - TOP TIP - I made a glider by drawing round the oval base shape (used double thickness of card from the box) included a little tugging lip at the front, and it now glides easily to/fro/left/right. Or buy a small tray. Frothing took me a week to master. I use a steel jug 5ins deep and add 1-2ins milk, the nozzle reaches the bottom, the milk expands, then you can start lowering the jug so the nozzle tip (where the steam comes out) is just below the surface creating more air bubbles. It heats up the milk which is good as these machines don’t provide a boiling hot drink. Be prepared to ALWAYS WIPE DOWN the machine and surrounding surfaces because THE MILK SPLATTERS EVERYWHERE. It comes with 3 measures (ID is underneath) I think the 2scoop measure is ideal for one coffee. The 1scoop is best for a small shot espresso-size. Mug height, it will take up to approx 5ins.

Elle est comme grand mère, elle sait faire un bon café.J'utilise deux cafés différents. Celui du matin, assez corsé est fait pour réveiller et un autre plus ""raffiné"" pour la journée. Si je dis ça c'est pour souligner un point vraiment positif. Il est possible de régler la quantité d'eau pour une tasse et pour deux tasses. Perso j'ai réglé pour chacun des deux cafés. Comme j'ai pris l'habitude de faire les cafés à l'unité, ça tombe très bien.Autre bon point, le mode d'emploi, en français et très bien détaillé.

L'endroit n'est pas forcément le mieux choisi mais une fois qu'on le sait...Avant de faire cet achat, j'ai lu les commentaires et en particulier les négatifs . A l'usage, je les trouve un peu excessifs. Certains trouvent la machine trop bruyante. Manifestement ils en sont à leur première machine de ce type car elle est vraiment silencieuse si on la compare à d'autres dans la même gamme de prix.J'ai lu qu'un monsieur se plaignait qu'elle ne fasse que 15 bars. Là aussi, il y a un manque de connaissance. Dix à douze bars sont largement suffisants pour faire un expresso. Ma dernière machine affichait 20 bars mais ce n'est qu'un argument commercial, le café n'était pas meilleur pour autant.Une critique qu'on trouve ici et qu'on trouve à propos de la plupart des machines, le café ne coule pas et n'est pas bon. Normal! La rondelle qu'il y a à l'extrémité de la cuillère n'est pas faite pour tasser la mouture. Si vous voulez que votre café dégage tous ses arômes, il faut qu'il soit aéré, que l'eau puisse circuler librement et atteindre chaque grain de votre mouture. Utilisez cette ""rondelle"" juste pour égaliser votre mouture sans forcer.Le café n'a pas le goût de celui du bistrot d'en bas. Normal également, il est fort peu probable que vous utilisiez le même café. Essayez un mélange Arabica/Robusta. Plus vous mettrez de Robusta et plus votre café sera corsé. Pour savoir quel café choisir le mieux est d'en tester plusieurs et de faire votre choix ensuite. Je me permets de la dire, dans le commerce équitable vous allez trouver d'excellents crus qui ne sont pas forcément plus cher que ceux on on voit les pubs. Attention tout de même, sur certaines plateformes de vente, certains vendeur vous vendent des paquets de café jusqu'à dix fois plus cher que ce qu'ils ne sont vendus en grande surface.En tout état de cause, cette machine est vraiment bien pour un prix raisonnable.",21 people found this helpful,Yes

Before that I had a Nespresso machine that used pods which also packed up after a couple of years due to pump failure.Let's hope this one lasts a little longer.This machine is solidly built, has a good quality feel to it. Everything fits well together.  The two features that I like about this machine is the automatic stop and the fast turnaround time. The reheat is instantaneous thanks to the use of thermoblock heating system, and it's ready for the next one before you even have time to empty and refill the coffee ground.The water capacity is only 1L but it's really not a problem because filling it is so easy.The noise is no worse than any other machines and there's hardly any vibration thanks to the solid and weighty construction.The programmable setting menu is not the most obvious and intuitive to use but you only have to do it once. You can set the water temperature, water hardness, water amount for each of the cup settings, and there's a descaling programme you need to use from time to time. There""re only 3 buttons and lights, so you adjust the settings by pressing and/or holding the buttons in different sequences. You won't remember which is which after 3 months, so keep the instruction booklet safe!!The result is a lovely rich, smooth aromatic coffee with good crema lasting well into the minutes, and that's with normal off the shelve supermarket pre-ground Lavazza espresso coffee ground.It taste much better than the Swan machine that I had, with much smoother coffee, less bitterness and much better and longer lasting crema, all with the same coffee ground.I'm sure if you spent a 4 figure sum on a machine you'll get a better result comparable to the professionals, but for a mere mortal I doubt I'll be able to easily tell the difference. It's simple to use for a daily morning coffee, it's easy to use, no fuss, easy to clean. For a machine south of the couple of hundred pounds it's definitely a good buy.",One person found this helpful,Yes

Well, hats off to De'Longhi for this cracking wee machine. It does have an add-on platform for the wee espresso cups, but that's relegated to the back of a cupboard for me.It also comes with 3 filters - for a 2 cup, a 1 cup, and one to take coffee pods - personally I detest the environmental profligacy associated with pods, but each to their own - but it's an option with this machine!This a smart wee machine -  you can choose between 3 heat setting for the coffee (Low/Med/High) - default id medium and I've left it at that - you can also set the water hardness through a menu, and a wee bonus, the machine is supplied with a descaler pack.Coffee making - there is some useful info in the instructions that will help you to make coffee to your particular taste. For me, I use Lavazza coffee after trialing many others, and I like my coffee strong - this machine delivers!It gives a measured amount of water for the filter size you are using - Tip - if you want to extract more, just run it again, but I recommend you don't - the machine does a great job of stopping at just the sweet spot for the extraction of the best part of the coffee, leaving the bitter 'tails' behind.Space wise, the machine is nice and slim, so takes up minimal space, and the water reservoir is a really good, big size, and easy to see the fill level as it's external.Now, the milk steamer - personally I don't use it - but if you do, it creates plenty, plenty of steam! I know this because the set up instructions ask you to run 5 measures through the filter, then switch to steam and run until the reservoir is empty - well frankly my kitchen was resembling a sauna before the reservoir was even half empty! So I did choose ignore the request to continue until empty...Cleaning - my last coffee machine lasted me many, many years, but had 1 weakness and 1 avoidable weakness..The coffee filter had a plate with many very fine holes, with a void behind that, and then the filter base base had one small hole leading to the spouts that deliver the coffee. Over time, the coffee solids built up behind the fine plate and blocked it - this machine has a removable filter plate - easy to maintain - brilliant!The 2nd issue with my old machine was the water distribution plate in the machine that the coffee presses up against once the filter holder is inserted into the machine - that plate should be periodically removed and clean behind it - on my old machine that needed a socket set and I left it too long resulting in pressure build up which burst a hose fitting on the high pressure side of the pump - this one just needs a Phillips screwdriver - easy - but don't ignore this for occasional cleaning, especially if you live in a hard water area.Overall then, a very smart machine, takes up minimal worktop space, is very functional, takes pretty much all mugs up to 12-13cm high (the taller ones you can probably manipulate in) and easy to clean.

Small footprint so doesn't take up loads of counter space. The press basket fits snugly and the used coffee grounds are nearly dry immediately after the cycle so its easy to clean. Cleaning is best done soon after the press cycle is complete as the used grounds can set quite hard. The milk frother is very effective and doesn't take long(about 20 seconds for a standard cup latte) to bring the milk up to 64C (the more milk the longer it il take).There are only 3 multi function buttons one lever and an on/off switch so you need to read the instructions as its not very intuitive. However once I worked out what my regular setting is it was easy. I would still need to read the instructions to do anything else though so keep them safe.At this price the machine is excellent value and out performs many higher spec machines I have experience of.,3 people found this helpful,Yes

Si parla di buona qualità, prezzo accessibile, possibilità di utilizzare cialde o caffè macinato, cappuccinatore incluso. Dopo quasi un mese mi sento di dare la mia:- 📦 CONFEZIONE: Abbastanza soddisfatto di ciò che si trova in dotazione: oltre la macchina ci sono 3 filtri (1 per la cialda, 1 per caffè macinato tazza singola, 1 per caffè macinato per due tazze), un kit per la decalcificazione e il manuale.- ⚒ QUALITA': La macchina si presenta solida, robusta ed è anche bella da vedere. Noi l'abbiamo presa grigia che è un colore neutro che sta bene ovunque. Inizialmente questa stabilità è un po' minacciata dalla forza che serve per inserire e togliere il portafiltro, ma con il passare del tempo questo attrito si riduce e il movimento diventa più fluido.- 👅 SAPORE: Il sapore del caffè dipende molto dalla qualità che utilizzate, noi per ora stiamo usando cialde Kimbo e ci stiamo trovando bene, esce corposo e dal sapore deciso.Passiamo alle note negative...- 🌡 TEMPERATURA DEL CAFFE': Era il mio timore più grande perché avevo letto in più recensioni che non fosse adeguatamente elevata e devo dire che posso confermare. Purtroppo, nonostante abbia impostato la temperatura massima, il difetto più grande di questa macchinetta è proprio questo, per gustarsi un caffè decisamente caldo è necessario far uscire prima una tazzina di acqua (meglio due in realtà) a vuoto per scaldare la caldaia e poi preparare il caffè.Il problema è che se se ne devono fare più di due, il primo nel frattempo non avendo  comunque una temperatura elevata si raffredderà. Perciò andrebbe bevuto di corsa praticamente, appena fatto...Questa cosa per me non è ammissibile perché con una Nescafè a capsule da 50€ ottenevo caffè bollente senza farmi tante preoccupazioni!- 🧽 PULIZIA: Generalmente appena finisco di fare il caffè, tolgo il portafiltro, il filtro, li sciacquo per bene con acqua corrente e li asciugo. Inoltre passo un foglio di carta assorbente nel punto da cui fuoriesce l'acqua, essendo a contatto con la cialda/caffè macinato.Per fortuna, come detto già nel punto precedente, faccio sempre scorrere una tazzina di acqua a vuoto prima dell'utilizzo. Mi sono accorto infatti che, nel fare questa operazione, non esce acqua limpida ma leggermente macchiata di caffè, nonostante abbia fatto l'operazione di pulizia in precedenza! Perciò attenzione, fate scorrere sempre un po' di acqua prima di usarla, altrimenti berrete residui del precedente utilizzo!- 🎧 RUMORE: Tutto sommato non è molto rumorosa, ma se devo essere onesto a volte emette alcune vibrazioni che fanno un po' di casino. Niente di eccessivamente fastidioso comunque.- ☕️ CAPPUCCINATORE: Non è molto intuitivo in realtà. Comunque una volta capito il meccanismo, capisci che devi prima fare il caffè altrimenti, mentre monti il latte, la caldaia della macchinetta si surriscalda e va in blocco. Sul manuale c'è scritto di far uscire un po' di acqua a vuoto dall'ugello del vapore, ma nonostante abbia fatto diversi tentativi, non usciva più niente e ho dovuto che la macchinetta si raffreddasse autonomamente.___________________________________________________________________________________________- ❌CONCLUSIONI: La De'Longhi Dedica è una macchina di buona qualità, piacevole da utilizzare e che permette una buona esperienza con il caffè, ma non mi sento di promuoverla. Purtroppo la temperatura non è soddisfacente, a meno che non si utilizzino gli espedienti descritti in precedenza e per me questa è una grandissima pecca.",59 people found this helpful,Yes

We have the silver one and it is a nice quality/looking machine. Doesn't take up much space in our kitchen with limited work surface and was pleasantly surprised that you can change the heat the water gets to and amount of water that comes through your espresso. It also has a cup heater but that heats up after you've made a coffee so for our house where we only use it twice a day we don't get much use from this. It is a bit fiddly to change the settings but as long as you read the manual its alright and once you have it set how you want its straightforward. It's also really easy to get a good froth for your latte or cappuccino if that's something you're inexperienced with. Good for a household where you'll be making one or two cups at a time if you're using the milk frother as when it gets hot you have to vent it (to cool the water so it doesn't burn the next espresso) to go back and forth between that and making the next coffee, or let the coffee crema die on the earlier ones and do the milk in one go. But that's to be expected. It's just something to consider if you've not owned a machine before and want it for when you have a few guests. A pod machine might be more suitable for you.

The machine, if left switched on, is on stand-by all the time. One only needs to press the ""cup"" button, wait a few seconds and the machine is ready to make espresso. Can stop the flow at any time by pressing the ""cup""button again. I like short espresso coffee. I really bought it for expresso coffee and not cappuccino. I think someone in the house has tried to make one and I believe it was ok(ish). Having said that. To get a good amount of steam and pressure the machine must have a big tank (just like your steam iron). This will suffice to heat and froth a cup of milk. To expect a shop style cappuccino from such a small machine is simply unreasonable. Excellent machine and easy to clean. One single problem (which is not a big problem). Make sure you always have water in the tank. If not, the machine will not be able to make  you a coffee but it will also ""freeze"".

The temperature throughout the Espresso being filtered through is well maintained so you do get a bitter/burnt taste.The machine is also relatviely easy to use, but for those unusre on how to use it, there is alot of videos on youtube showcasing how to effectively use and clean the machine.Highly Highly HIGHLY recommend this product,5/5( Click “Helpful” if this helped ^__^ )",N/A,Yes

I imagine the results would be as good if I bought pre-ground coffee - maybe better?..The only issue I have experienced was when a few coffees caused the pump to struggle to push water through the coffee/filter - I found the issue was not the Dedica at all and I was grinding the beans too fine (didn't know that was a thing, I do now!).My wife has started using it - the simplicity and results make this a great purchase.

I particularly love the fact that the coffee filter has 3 buds and I don't have to look underneath to mach them to the machine, it goes in pretty easily. We also enjoy the benefit of being able to adjust the machine settings, such as the quantity for each espresso or adjusting the water hardness - the instructions on how to do this are easy to follow.  An other quality worth of mention is that once the coffee or the cappuccino is done the spouts don't drip as much as other coffee machines I've previously owned, only a couple of drops. The machine also has a removable base to allow taller mugs in. I manage to simultaneously fill 2 mugs with coffee although in all fairness the base does not comfortably allow for both of them - still it doesn't bother me that much.Regarding the quality of the coffee no complaints whatsoever - strong coffee and with a nice dense crema on top.

I've now put it on soft water mode and use only brita filter water so it should take a while longer this time before needing it again.Pro tip: Turn the temp to high in the settings menu - I done this after descaling so about a month in and it made the coffees even nicer!

Only got it yesterday, so I can't speak about the durability or how well it will be in time. But in the 24 hours I've had it I've found it to be a really good machine. It's small so it doesn't take up too much of the kitchen counter. It makes delicious coffee and the milk steamer works really well and makes for a delicious cappuccino. It heats up super quick from turning on in the morning, it's actually quicker than my kettle would boil.It takes maybe 15-40 minutes to read the instructions to learn how to set it up, change the settings, etc. But after that it's great.I'm usually the type to skip the instructions myself, but I recommend that you do read it if you buy this machine, it's well worth it to take the time and go through the instructions for the first time you use it to make sure you don't miss out on it's features like setting your preferred brewing temperature among other settings.The only thing I can fault on it is that the cup warmer on the top is a bit pointless for home users as the time it takes to be ready is so short that your cup will not be warmed up unless you choose to wait much longer.

Das hat uns aber einige Tage Kalibrierung und Nerven gekostet, daher hier ein paar Tipps:• Ziel ist es, dass der Espresso 25 Sekunden durchläuft, eine stabile Crema hat und nicht bitter schmeckt. (Und die 25 Sekunden haben nichts mit der Wassermenge zu tun - die bleibt immer gleich. Die Temperatur steht bei uns auf „mittel“.)• Daher probiert man vor allem am Pulver herum. Eine günstige Rommelsbacher Mühle bringt leider gar nichts (zu grob), bei uns wurde es dann eine Graef CM800. Ja, die kostet dann fast soviel wie die Dedica, aber das ist sie auch wert. Wirklich.Bei der CM800 haben wir das innere Mahlwerk volle 5 Stufen/Schrauben Richtung „fine“ gestellt. Am äußeren Ring steht sie auf 4. Das ist so fein, dass das Pulver relativ langsam kommt und leicht klumpt. Ein bisschen wie Puderzucker.Wichtig ist auch, dass der Kaffee nicht zu alt ist. Also eher keine Vorratskäufe mit Kaffeebohnen. Wir benutzen übrigens Toraldo Bluette.Das war mit Abstand der schwierigste Teil.• Was sich auch lohnt, ist der Kauf von einwandigen Sieben. In der Dedica sind doppelwandige „Cremasiebe“ mitgeliefert, die machen zwar solide Crema, aber sehr unsoliden Geschmack. Die Siebe kosten ca. 14€ und sind auch von Graef. (Für das Doppel-Shot Sieb muss man das Plastikteil aus dem Siebträger rausschrauben und etwas flacher schneiden. Das klingt aber wilder als es ist. Wir benutzen fast nur das Singleshot-Sieb.)• Dann muss man probieren, wieviel Kaffee in den Siebträger muss und wie fest man ihn anpresst. Wir machen ihn bis ca 5mm unter den Rand des Siebträgers voll. Angepresst natürlich. Zwischendurch sollte man oft klopfen, damit das Pulver gleichmäßig verteilt ist. Sonst sucht sich das Wasser den einfachsten Weg und läuft am Geschmack vorbei.Noch ein wichtiger Zusatzkauf: ein gescheiter Metall-Tamper. Mitgeliefert ist ein wabbeliges Plastikteil, mit dem man nicht annähernd den richtigen Druck erzeugt. 14kg Druck sollen es übrigens sein. Also ganz ordentlich, aber auch nicht brutal reinknallen.• Fast am Ziel. Den nächsten Punkt nennen Fachleute die „Jagd nach dem Mäuseschwänzchen“. Der Espresso soll so langsam aus der Maschine laufen, dass sich der Strahl etwas bewegt - eben wie ein Mäuseschwänzchen. Um die 25 Sekunden zu erreichen, muss man den Mahlgrad und die Kaffeemenge feintunen. Der perfekte Punkt ist kurz bevor nichts mehr rauskommt.• Milchschaum funktioniert mit der Maschine auch fantastisch, dafür muss man nur darauf achten, dass das Milchkännchen und die Milch immer kalt sind, damit man mehr Zeit hat den perfekten Schaum zu machen. Man muss auch gar nicht in der Milch „rumrühren“, sondern es reicht die Milch „rollen“ zu lassen. Also sie rollt an der Düse und rührt sich damit selbst die dicken Blasen unter. Wenn das Milchkännchen unten so heiß ist, dass man es nicht mehr anfassen kann, ist sie heiß genug. Wer zulange schäumt, macht die Süße in der Milch kaputt.Das waren unsere Erfahrungen. Ich hoffe es hilft dem ein oder anderen bei der Einrichtung und spart ein paar Stunden. Viel Erfolg!",897 people found this helpful,Yes

Kind of like making an Americano, maybe, except that your additional hot water is just weaker coffee from the same ESE pod, so somewhat more cost-effective, as well.  If I want a more robust/bigger mug of coffee I might splurge and use two pods in quick succession but tbh I haven't found it necessary.  Himself prefers his cuppa stronger and goes for the espresso effect using Senseo-compatible single-serve pods (as he prefers the brand of coffee that packages it that way and has yet to find it in ESE pods), and although it's not an exact fit, it works and he gets a great coffee.

I chose this machine based on its huge popularity and decent feedback rating. Alas I have not been impressed so far. The main issue I have faced is its inconsistent performance. I used the same amount of the same ground beans every day yet some days the coffee flows through freely, some days it drips and some days nothing at all. On the days it drips it seems to burn the coffee. On the days nothing happens at all I've wasted coffee. The cream layer is sometimes good, sometimes almost non-existent. The same goes for the steam wand. I drink flat whites and so I like a nice silky textured milk. Maybe one in ten times I get the desired texture despite using the same quantity of the same milk every single time. Just so inconsistent it makes for quite a stressful and frustrating experience.

   DeLonghi nos presenta uno de sus mejores productos con esta cafetera.En cuanto al diseño se trata de una cafetera metálica casi en su totalidad, con una base de plástico duro.Trae consigo tres filtros, un portafiltros y un descalcificante, buen detalle.La cafetera tiene una presión muy correcta de salida de café.Tanto la temperatura como el tiempo de extracción son programables.En cuanto a la espumadera de leche, tiene dos posiciones, Hot milk y capuchino, esta última te permite cremar la leche. Es casi imposible cremar mal la leche con esta cafetera. Con otros modelos de esta marca, había que tener un mayor manejo para evitar que la leche tomara burbujas de aire, sin embargo, con esta siempre se crema a la perfección.Adjunto un vídeo y una imagen.Por otro lado, la altura de las tazas es muy variables en cuanto a compatibilidad con la cafetera, pues su base de aluminio puede ser ajustada a distintas alturas.Por buscarle un punto a mejorar, cuando la cafetera toma presión, por un tiempo después ya no te permite extraer café. Esto se soluciona dejando salir toda la presión habiendo previamente despulsaso el botón de la presión.Recomiendo la cafetera.

I am not so impressed with this machine, the coffee is alright but not as nice as with the simpler machines (not so much crema)  and setting it up is fiddly.  The hot water nozzle works fine, but when slid down to heat milk for cappuccino, it's rubbish - hardly any steam and the milk remains cold and at the same volume (because nothing comes out).  I wish I had saved my money and bought another more basic machine.The small size is nice as it means it has less of a footprint in the kitchen, but because it is very light, it is easy to push a selection button whilst fitting the coffee holder or tip it over, though putting in less coffee grounds helps.

Wie schon in einigen Bewertungen zuvor beschrieben, baut die Maschine seit heute aus unerfindlichen Gründen keinen Druck mehr auf. Der Kompressor / die Pumpe läuft an wird dann immer leiser, um dann komplett aufzuhören. Es kommt kein Tropfen Espresso aus der Maschine, egal wie viel oder wenig Kaffeepulver man verwendet. Sie läuft nur noch ohne Kaffeepulver, also ohne Gegendruck. Sobald Druck aufgebaut wird (das sollten bei der Zubereitung von Espresso ja immerhin 9 bar sein) gibt sie auf. Die mehrfache Rücksetzung auf Werkseinstellungen haben hier keine Änderung herbei geführt. Selbst wenn, wäre es für mich nicht zumutbar alle paar Tage die Maschine neu einzustellen. Ich gehe von einem grundsätzlichen Designfehler aus (Sensoren, Programmierung etc.), so dass ich von dem Kauf der Maschine dringend abrate. Leider scheint es tatsächlich keine gute Siebträgermaschine in diesem Preissegment zu geben. Also lieber sparen oder eben darauf verzichten.",15 people found this helpful,Yes

Mas allá de que hayas ajustado bien la molienda de tu café -doy por sentado que tienes molinillo y café en grano-.La parte buena de esto es que utilizando los filtros que trae, al ser presurizados, no necesitarás un molinillo muy sofisticado. Con uno que puedes encontrar por aquí de 30€/40€ es suficiente.Pero para el 99% de la gente, es una cafetera que recomiendo si lo que necesitas es un espresso rapido. La ventaja frente a otras es que no requiere un calentamiento previo. Se enciende y casi al instante puedes comenzar a hacer cafés.Para ese 1%... si te quieres complicar la vida -cosa que no te recomiendo a este nivel- puedes comprarte un portafiltros 'botomless' o simplemente serrar el original y añadirle una canasta despresurizada. Eso si, requerirá una molienda mas fina (tendrás que mejorar el molinillo).Investiga un poco sobre ratios (1:2 suele ser el ideal) y tiempo de infusion y obtendras un mejor café.",10 people found this helpful,Yes

Das komplette Gehäuse ist in Edelstahl gehalten. Der Siebträger ist auch Vollmetall, richtig schwer und liegt super in der Hand. Das Sieb klackt richtig fest mechanisch ein. Materialien und Verarbeiten lassen einen traumhaften Kaffee erhoffen.Contra:Crema - Fehlanzeige. Habe 4 Bohnensorten probiert und verschiedenste Mahlgrade (Handmühle mit Keramikmahlwerk). Alles was aus der Maschine kommt ist einfach nur ein starker Kaffee. Aber weder ein Espresso noch ein Caffé Crema.Mahlt man den Kaffee zu fein, schafft es die Maschine noch nicht mal Wasser durchzupressen. Entweder bricht sie nach 10 Sekunden von allein ab oder es tröpfelt ein bisschen was in die Tasse. Von 15 Bar kann da keine Rede sein.Man kann nur wählen zwischen Wassermenge für 1 oder 2 Tassen. Das lässt wenig Spielraum bei Mahlgrad usw. aber sie schafft ja eh nichts. ;)Der Milchaufschäumer geht mal - und mal geht er nicht. in 5 von 10 Fällen geht er nur für 5 Sekunden und dann fängt die Maschine an wegen angeblicher Überhitzung zu blinken.Fazit:Gerät geht zurück. Totaler Mist. Schade. Finde sie mega schön und viele andere Modelle haben selbst beim doppelten Preis viel billige Plastik verbaut.",13 people found this helpful,Yes

Im folgenden bewerte ich (nach einer kurzen Beschreibung) nicht den Warehouse Deal beziehungsweise den speziellen Zustand der Maschine, sondern die De'Longhi Dedica Style EC 685.M an sich.Zum Warehouse-Deal:Nachdem uns in den letzten Wochen der Espresso und Kaffee aus unserem Vollautomaten (ebenso De'Longhi) trotz regelmäßiger Reinigung & Pflege sowie recht guter Bohnen nicht mehr so richtig schmecken wollte, dachte ich etwas intensiver über den Einstieg in die Welt der Siebträger nach. Da ich seit einigen Jahren wenn möglich versuche , auch Geräten in ihrem zweiten Leben eine Chance zu geben und für mich die Wegwerfkultur etwas zu minimieren, bestellte ich eine Dedica für gerade mal 75,-.€ als Warehouse-Deal. Neben den zu erwarteten kleineren Kratzern und einer Delle zeichnete sich mein Exemplar durch einen mechanisch defekten Einschalter aus, den ich dann selbst recht simpel repartieren konnte. Amazon hätte die Maschine zur Reparatur zurückgenommen, dass wäre jedoch wieder recht aufwendige geworden, zudem hatte ich schon angefangen, die Maschine für uns etwas zu verbessern (s.u.).Zur Dedica an sich:Sie ist zwar unser erster Siebträger zuhause, jedoch habe ich schon häufiger bei Freunden etc. mit solchen Geräten einen Espresso/Kaffegetränk hergestellt.Die De'longhi ist klein, findet so auch auf übersichtlichen Flächen ihren Platz, leicht, hat ein Metall-/Kunststoffgehäuse und an für sich wirklich ordentlich verarbeitet. Durch die Thermoblock-Konstruktion (sie hat keinen Kessel, das Wasser fliesst Wasser durch ein elektrisch beheiztes Rohr) heizt sie schnell auf (max. 2 Minuten) und ist ebenso schnell aus dem zu programmierenden Ruhemodus wieder in Betriebsbereitschaft.Neben der Maschine an sich und einem große wie einem kleinen jeweils doppelwandigem Sieb zur Kaffeepulveraufnahme ist ein Kunststofftamper/Dosierlöffel dabei, so dass, fein gemahlene Kaffeebohnen vorausgesetzt, der Start direkt erfolgen kann.Heraus kommt dann, je nach Bohnen, ein mehr oder weniger genießbarer bis guter Espresso mit immer ordentlicher Creme. Durch die Konstruktion von doppelwandigem Sieb, das darunter noch einen zweiten Boden mit winzigem Loch hat, wird das gesamte Kaffeeextrakt mit sehr hohem Druck durch das Löchlein gepresst. So entsteht zwangsweise eine Crema, egal wie gut/alt die Bohnen sind bzw. das fertige Pulver ist. Der Siebträger, in welchem die Siebe mit einer simplen Klammer befestigt sind, hat darunter noch eine Kunststoffkonstruktion, die die Kaffeeflüssigkeit gleichmäßig auf die beiden Austrittslöcher verteilt. So können bei großem (doppeltem Sieb) theoretisch zwei Tassen gleichzeitig mit je einem Espresso gefüllt werden, wenn diese Tassen denn nebeneinander auf der Abstellfläche Platz finden.Bemüht man sich nun um gute Bohnen, welche man dann idealerweise noch in einer ordentlichen Mühle reguliert fein mahlen kann (hier wird die Mühle sicherlich so teuer wie die Dedica werden, jedoch lohnt sich die Investition in eine gute (ggf. gebrauchte) Mühle, so produziert die Maschinen einen netten Espresso. Allerdings kann man aufgrund der o.a. Siebkonstruktion den Extraktionsprozess nicht vollumfänglich steuern und die Ergebnisse sind m.E.nicht immer reproduzierbar.Die Herstellung eines Milchschaums gelingt mit der Aufschäumlanze recht gut, sicherlich hat die Maschine nicht den Druck eines großen Siebträgers mit voluminösem Kessel, aber mit etwas Übung läßt sich schnell ein stabiler Milchschaum erzeugen.Die Wassertemperatur ist in 3 Stufen programmierbar, die Wassermenge ist für doppelten und einfachen Bezug ebenso einstellbar wie die Wasserhärte und die Zeitspanne, bis sich die Dedica in einen energiesparenden Ruhezustand versetzt.Zusammengefasst bin bzw. war ich (fast) zufrieden mit den Ergebnissen, auch für den regulären Preis hier eine Empfehlung und 3,5 Sterne, die fehlenden liegen in den besonderen Sieben und dem zugehörigen Träger begründet.Aber die Maschine machte Neugierde auf „mehr“…Außerhalb der Bewertung:Für mich als (inzwischen etwas belesener Halb-Laie) wird der Geschmack des Espressos (natürlich neben dem Bohnen) hauptsächlich durch die Extraktionszeit, also die Zeit, in der das Wasser das Kaffeepulver durchquert und damit Kontakt hat, geprägt. Steuerbar ist das zum einen durch die Menge wie den Mahlgrad der Bohnen (je feiner, desto dichter das Kaffeemehl) sowie die Menge des Wassers. Der Wasserdruck ist nicht veränderbar. Natürlich spielt auch der Anpressdruck, mit der das Kaffeepulver im Sieb mit dem Tamper (vergesst das beiliegende Plastikteil und kauft einen vernünftigen) eingedrückt wird, eine gewisse Rolle, aber hier gehe ich davon aus, dass man dies auch manuell immer wieder reproduzieren kann und mit recht gleichem Druck das Kaffeepulver festdrückt. Also kann ich über die Pulvermenge, sowie den Mahlgrad und die Wassermenge kontrollieren bzw. festlegen, wie lange Pulver und Wasser in Kontakt sind. Ist diese Zeit zu kurz, werden mehr saure Bestandteile gelöst, ist diese Zeitspanne zu groß, werden mehr bittere Bestandteile gelöst. Durch die doppelwandige Form der original Siebe habe ich jedoch einen unberechenbaren Faktor, der zwar eine gute Crema erzeugt (sogar mit gekauftem Espressopulver), das Extrakt jedoch nicht direkt unter dem Sieb austreten lässt. Es braucht mehr oder weniger lange, um dann in einem dünnen Strahl aus dem Löchlein im zweiten Boden herauszuspritzen.Aus diesem Grunde habe ich einige im Internet gefunden Ratschläge befolgt und den Siebträger so umgebaut (das untere Ende abgeschnitten), dass ich nun nachträglich gekaufte einwandige Siebe verwenden kann.Und so versuche ich nun über die oben dargestellten Parameter, den Geschmack des produzierten Kaffeeextrakt zu beeinflussen.Nach einigem Üben und unter Nutzung einer Briefwaage (Wasser- und Pulvermenge) klappt es inzwischen auch recht gut, so dass ich mit dieser modifizierten Dedica aktuell wirklich glücklich bin. Nachteil ist, zumindest sagt dies meine Familie, dass ich nun morgens, mittags und abends doch einige Zeit (gutgelaunt) vor Mühle wie Siebträger verbringe. Aber eben diese besagte Familie hat sich auch zu Kaffeengenießern entwickelt, und ich komme aus dem Espresso machen und Milchaufschäumen nicht heraus…",4 people found this helpful,Yes

   This is a good espresso machine that is consistent, simple, and small. There is some learning curve to get used to this machine, but once you have it, it only take 5 minutes from start to finish (cleaning) for a nice shot of espresso. The machine heats up quickly; it takes only 40 seconds to get started. But I start by warming up the filter and the cup by pulling an empty shot. I found that  the water temperature gets slightly higher after the initial pull. The next step is getting the actual espresso shot. Most of the time, I do double shots, and it usually takes around 25~30 sec. For the single shot, it takes about 20 sec. (For comparison, Starbucks’ $180,00 fully automatic Mastrena machine takes 18~24 seconds for quad shots.) 30 seconds double shot is not bad for an entry level espresso machine, and I found the shot quality is consistent. Of course it’s not just the machine that makes a perfect shot of espresso, but when it comes to the quality of the shots, the machine’s consistency is critical. I found the default medium temperature is fine for me, but in the setting, I can also change the temperature to low, or high if needed.I am not a latte/cappuccino drinker, so I don't do steaming often, but when I do, this machine has no problem. I don’t get super creamy and velvety frothed milk, but it does its job (steaming milk). It takes about 60 seconds to get to around 160 degree. And the water needs to be purged right after steaming, before pulling the shots. Those are a few extra steps to go through, but it only takes about 20 seconds.Overall, this is a nice little machine. It is only somewhat bigger than my Nespresso Pixie,  and I like the compact design since it doesn’t take up so much counter top space. Recently my Pixie started leaking,  and I got tired of buying costly ‘capsules’ from Nespresso. I also couldn’t find a reliable reusable nespresso filter. So in my defense, a manual machine like this could justify my decision. I was looking for a manual/semi automatic machine that’s not too expensive and “small” with the ease of maintaining.I think the machine is priced slightly high for what it is, but, nonetheless, I am satisfied with the shot quality I get. For a better price option, in my opinion, the previous 680 model is good option (currently at $235), and the only difference I found is the steaming wand. This newer version has steaming options for ‘hot milk’ and ‘cappuccino’ and the 680 model doesn’t. Honestly, I don’t think this minor change is worth more than $100 price difference since milk steaming relies (not 100%) on the pitcher handling. But for americano,  espresso con panna, straight espresso shots, or just simple latter and cappuccino, I am sure both models would do equally good job.",296 people found this helpful,No

Yes, the machine give you a descaling warning after couple of months but you can just switch it off or even simply ignore it (nothing really changes but the color of one of the buttons, that’s all really).

Cappuccino maker works great and it’s easy to clean (you purge it before and after, wipe it with a tissue, done). Never gave me any problems so far really. The only issue I have with it is that it won’t run if the coffee is grinded to a very fine level. And sometimes I get or buy coffee that is very fine. That’s my only isssue with it.

Here's why I bought this machine...at an average cost of $3.50/cappuccino, I would have spent over $2,500 in a coffee bar.  Having re-read all the reviews, it is very important to realize that this machine delivers espresso in your own home similar to what you get from the typical coffee bar's $10K machine that is ""professionally"" maintained. It does have a learning curve though, and as a consumer, it is up to the purchaser to do the research (there are many YouTube videos, even on this machine) on what to do and not to do when purchasing/using an in-home espresso machine. It is equally important to follow the directions in the owner's manual regarding cleaning/descaling, proper grinding, overheating, and so forth. Expect to go through trial and error at first, but with a little patience, once you get it right (it won't take too long), you'll be very pleased. I would highly recommend this machine, as well as Lavazza Super Crema Whole Bean Coffee Blend, Medium Espresso Roast to go with it.",36 people found this helpful,Yes

I purchased this model in July 2019 (I'm writing this review in Nov 2019), and have used it multiple times a day since I purchased it. Several highlights that make this one of the best I've used:a) Ease of useb) Ease of clean-up!c) Great *consistent* flavor extractionThe light over my counter probably makes things look a little amber, but this machine really does pull a beautiful caramel-colored crema (as seen in these photos). As you can probably tell, this machine does not make a thick crema though. That's a good thing! For those new to espresso, you don't want a lot of crema. Depending on the coffee roast and the machine, crema can be bitter. I have found a great locally roasted espresso that works really well with this machine to produce a lovely rich under note, and a slightly bitter-sweet crema. Therefore, I don't stir my espresso since I enjoy that slight contrast. If you find the crema is too bitter, be sure to stir it into the darker coffee below the surface. That will even the notes out a bit.I typically drink espresso black, no sugar. That means I don't use the steam wand a great deal, so I don't really have many tips for working with the wand on this machine. But, the times when I have used the wand, I've stretched enough foam for a macchiato and that has turned out quite well.A couple of other tips:1. You will need to experiment with the brand of espresso beans you use, and with the grind of the bean. No two espresso machines are the same, so no two machines with pull your shots exactly the same way either. For instance, regardless of which roaster I buy my beans from, my machine works better if I grind on Fine which is slightly more course than the Espresso setting on most grinders. I just get an overall better-tasting and better-looking cup of espresso that way.2. Experiment with flavor profiles in the espresso blend you use. Try different roasts from different roasters. It's amazing how much variation you'll get from one roaster to another. I've found a local roaster who makes a great espresso blend that I've not gotten down to the place that I pull a shot that has a nice, rich under note with a pretty smooth finish (very little bitterness in the crema). There's a good balance even without stirring the espresso. some people like brighter, more acidic roasts, that's great, too.3. Make sure your espresso beans are as fresh as possible, and try not to let an open package of coffee sit for more than a couple of weeks.Those things are as important as operating the machine in terms of pulling a quality cup of espresso that it satisfying to both the sense of smell and taste. (I love the aroma of espresso in the house.)Overall, the Dedica Deluxe has been a great machine thus far. I use it (on average) 2-4 times a day, and I couldn't be happier. The sleek design fits neatly on my counter, and it looks good, too.",5 people found this helpful,Yes

It doesn't last.,"Update: 05/31/2020 This is a beautiful machine and works great! The only problem is that the pump doesn't last.I would not recommend the extended warranty. Just put the 50 bucks into a new machine, because in 6 months or so you will have to buy a new machine anyway when the second one breaks down. And the replacement is slow so you are stuck having to go to Starbucks until the new machine arrives. After researching these machines, I see that NONE of them have pumps that last unless you buy a $5,000 machine as Starbucks uses.  What I do now is to buy two inexpensive Hamilton Beach machines (for half the price) and when one breaks I have a new machine instantly. The Hamilton Beach machine lasted seven months making one espresso per day. That's about par for the course. The Hamilton Beach is comparatively ugly but works just as well. It's too bad these pumps are not user-replaceable like automobile spark plugs!Original post:The pump stopped working before my warranty ran out. I must say, I had no problem with Customer Service. They had me use my phone to give them a live feed from my kitchen while they put me through troubleshooting steps. It took a good number of days to get the new machine, however.  I was sent another machine, and I resolved to treat the new one like a baby - with minimal use; i.e., using the double-cup filter only once a day.  And, I stopped using the machine to make hot water to fill up my 18 oz. mug, as I like ""Americano""; so I heated water in my electric kettle to save wear on the Delonghi. Never-the-less, the new machine quit pumping after 5 months of use. It made normal pumping sounds, but wouldn't push through the coffee. If DeLonghi would beef up the pump, that would be great, as whoever designed this machine did a super job - easy to use and looks exquisite. When the first machine quit, I looked online and bought a Hamilton Beach espresso machine as a  backup in case the DeLonghi failed again, and it was less than half the price. How long the Hamilton Beach will last, I don't know, but it did make a great cup of espresso coffee this morning.12/12/2019 UPDATE: Word of caution: My Hamilton Beach acted as if the pump had failed, just like the Delonghi. I looked online for a more expensive replacement and came across a user who said his expensive machine acted as if the pump had failed - wouldn't push through the coffee. However, this person did an update and said his problem was that the water tank was not fully seated, and that fixed the problem. That fixed my HB machine also. Note this was NOT the case with my Delonghi. The lesson is:NEVER let the water tank run out or get too low!Be sure to properly seat the water tank, every time!I was all set to buy a $500 machine tomorrow morning. This uses' advice saved me $500.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

It heats up very fast and produces excellent pressure. It presoaks the grounds which certainly helps the espresso. It is very simple to operate with minimal controls. My only real complaint is that it only comes with double-walled/pressurized filters. While the pressurized filter appears to create crema, it really only creates ""foam."" A single-walled filter would have been a cheap addition to the other 3 filters in the box and allowed the owner the choice of which to use. They don't even offer a single-walled filter for separate purchase, requiring you to buy a complete portafilter to get one that will work... an extra fifty bucks that a fifty-cent filter in the box would have saved me.The only other issue is common across most espresso makers; there needs to be an extra inch or two between the bottom of the portafilter and the drip tray to accommodate a full-sized coffee mug. It will accommodate a standard coffee cup, but nothing taller. It is no big deal for straight espresso, but the extra room would allow me to add a double shot directly to my moring coffee without having to make it in one cup and pour it into another... yeah, I know, I'm being a Karen about that one.",N/A,Yes

I easily use it two to three times a day.  It is not that large, and looks very sharp on the counter.  I like that the removable drip try allows me to either use a standard latte cup or if I would like to use a more traditional coffee mug, I can remove the tray.  The foaming nozzle works well.  I haven't mastered latte art quite yet, but it gives me a thick foam.  I do wish the stainless steel milk frothing cup and a better tamper were included with the purchase, but they were easy add-ons.  I did notice that after steaming you can't go right back to making another coffee as the water in the line is too hot, indicated by flashing buttons.  So after steaming, I press a coffee buttom and then bleed the steam from the line until only water comes out.  This clears the line of water water/steam and lets the machine cool down enough to do a second espresso.  I do find the warming tray on the top of the unit pretty much worthless.  Running the unit once without espresso in the pod flushes the lines and heats the mug.  I also do one run after brewing to clean the machine.  I've not had a single problem with it, and it seems to balance expense against value.

I've had a DeLonghi EC702 espresso machine for 9 years. My wife and I use it twice daily, sometimes more if we're having guests over. The EC702 never has had issues with creme and making a good cup. We decided to treat ourselves and upgrade to this compact and nice looking machine, the Dedica Deluxe EC685W. We were excited when it came fast and set it up right away. I went through the normal setup process, ran 2 tanks of water through like the instructions say. Right away I was troubled by leaking. Due to what appears to be a design flaw, putting water in the tank causing it to leak a little bit and create a puddle under the back. It happened 2 days in a row. It stopped after a few seconds, but other reviews will show you it can get worse over time. My biggest concern was the quality of extraction. You can see in my picture by comparison, a fresh extraction from identical beans, compared to a 9 years old EC702, this newer machine truly falls short. I'm not a coffee snob, but even I could see the creme on the old machine (in the little bowl) versus what was just gotten from the Dedica Deluxe is very different. This was identical beans and espresso grind, the Dedica Deluxe can't create anything. To those who don't know, creme is indicative to how good the machine is doing at extracting from the beans. An old machine should not do so much better than a brand new (and more expensive) espresso maker. I tried many different thing, different grinds, light versus dark coffee, nothing mattered, the Dedica may look nice but can't produce a quality drink compared to even an older machine.

Failed 80% of the time though!,Machine drew a few of the best espresso shots I've ever had. The problem is that it took 5 tries to get it to work. Afterwards I had nothing but trouble getting decent shots. Sometimes I would put an empty basket and nothing came out. Other times water didn't even come out. I must've wasted 1 lb of coffee trying different ways and grinds. Sometimes it would work but most likely nothing would come out. Too bad because the flavor of the good shots was 5 stars.

I used to work in a coffee shop so I know how to make coffees and I don't think this can be beat on size and price/value if you want to make your own coffees from fresh ground. It makes a great cup of coffee and I have had no issues with it at all. My only gripe which is a bit niche to me I guess is that I owned the same model in Europe before I moved to the USA, and that had a removable insert inside the espresso metal pod where the coffee grounds sit. For some reason they have welded that in for the USA model, and I know from when I cleaned my other one you would get old coffee water collecting in there. Well now since it is welded in and I cannot remove that piece I have to shake the water out which is super annoying. I will look to see if I can get a replacement espresso pod which has the removable piece, but that aside HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I also bought one for my parents who love theirs. I make a black coffee in it daily and recommend running it for 3 shots to get a full mug as the flavour is much better than if you just added water to one (double) shot. I have also made successful latte's and cappucino's in it when the mood takes me. Just be aware when using the frother, you have to let a small amount of water out before putting the wand in your milk, otherwise you end up with slightly watery milk. Again a small quirk which once you realise it I don't even think about. I have previously owned a nespresso machine as well as drip coffee maker and would recommend this to anyone wanting a decent home coffee maker where they are not put off using loose coffee grounds",N/A,Yes

The milk steamer was especially difficult and it took a lot of tries to get this to work (tip: use whole milk and watch some videos).

Too many served espresso that tasted sweet and fruity, burnt, or lacked a nice crema.  Plus, the cost of espresso has increased a lot over the past two years.  I researched affordable at-home machines and hoped I picked a winner, and I did!  I found a local coffee roaster whose espresso did not taste fruity and bought 1/2 pound of its espresso roast.  I also bought its decaf beans.  After two tries with my new espresso machine, and a couple of tweaks with my hand grinder, I was able to make such a delicious espresso that was how I loved the taste and the creaminess of the crema.  The best part is that I am in control of the caffeine content.  I don't have to wonder if the coffee shop will serve a larger than usual espresso that will zing me for the rest of the day.  And I don't have the disappointment of a poor tasting espresso, thinking, ""maybe tomorrow it will taste better,"" depending on the barista.  The machine makes the decaf version just as well.

The espresso is great for those of us who don't like to fuss too much with perfect grind, perfect tamp, etc. Put your grounds in, tamp them a bit, load the portafilter, and push the button. Comes out great every time.I'm giving it four stars because the milk frother is a little underwhelming. Actually it froths fine (the ""hot milk"" position is perfect for lattes, nice and velvety without too much foam) but takes a little while. The manual says not to froth for more than 60 seconds, and the machine shuts the steam off after that. But it's not long enough, at least when you're frothing milk for two lattes. So I switch the frother off, wait a few seconds, and switch it back on to finish. No big deal and seems to work fine. I am just hoping this is not stressing out the machine in any way.I really like the water tank, very easy to remove, fill, re-attach, etc. Cleaning the unit is easy and straightforward as well.A couple of minor notes1, the cup warmer is barely warm at all. This is not an issue for me, but if that's an important feature for you, it might be a consideration.2-there's a little disc at the bottom of the brew basket that is a bit tricky to remove for rinsing/cleaning. It has a little tab on the edge to grab, but I sure can't get it with my fingers. I have to use small needle-nose pliers to grab and pop it out. Sort of a strange design choice, but again not a big deal.I'm not usually focused much on how an appliance looks, but gotta say this one looks quite nice on our counter.Great machine for those of us who enjoy good espresso but don't want to have to devote hours to learning the barista arts.

Descaled once and it was a very easy process.  Excellent machine and makes great espresso when used with non-pressurized filter.Depending upon Price, either in the sweet spot or no-man’s land, best with a non-pressurized filterSo what do I mean?  There are essentially three options if you want your espresso in a minute (i.e. Thermoblock/Thermocoil)- in the low-to-mid $100’s is a Nespresso, in the $500 to $600 range is the Breville Barista Express or Infuser (darlings of the sub-$1000 category), in between is the Delonghi Dedica.A Nespresso is quick and easy but- requires a separate frother, has limited flexibility and very expensive capsules.Delonghi Dedica, can be almost as quick and easy using the E.S.E pods (essentially a giant tea bag with coffee) at half the price of a nespresso capsules.  You have the flexibility of using fresh ground coffee with the included pressurized filters and of course a built-in steam frother.Breville machines have the ability to pull professional shots with the included non-pressurized filters and includes a pre-infusion stage (a pre-stage that infuses coffee grinds with low pressure hot water immediately before the extraction phase)- these are considered the 2 biggest features that enable a high quality espresso.  There are a few other features- thermocoil which is bit more robust than Dedica’s thermoclock and can improve heat consistency, a pressure gauge and PID (digital thermometer).How the Dedica compares to the Breville.  Well you can get a non-pressurized filter for $6, it’s not made by Delonghi but is the Mr. Coffee 4101 (or equivalent), and in addition even though Delonghi doesn’t advertise it, the Dedica also pre-infuses.  If you have the Dedica this is what happens in the 5 second phase when the pump starts for a couple of seconds and then pauses for a few seconds before the pumps starts up again.  Use of the non-pressurized filter is vital to improve the espresso significantly and generates a true crema.  The Breville’s thermocoil is better but not vital, same with the pressure gauge which is cool but not vital.  The PID is definitely a worthwhile feature.  These three are worthwhile but at what cost.If you have to pay the $349 list price for the Dedica then the price difference for the Infuser is only $150, even less if you can find the Infuser discounted.  At $150 or less, the added features of the Breville are worth the price.  In addition, the $200 increase over a Nespresso might not make sense, thus the Dedica is in no-man’s land.  If you can get a good discount on the Dedica to the point where it is more than $200 less than the Breville, then the added features of the may not be justified.  A discounted price for the Dedica is a  small enough difference compared to a Nespresso and may make more sense.  Hence, a sizably discounted price put’s the Dedica in the sweet spot.",4 people found this helpful,No

I have looked for there older design baskets new or used with no luck. I did buy a bottomless portafilter for when I’m at home (I use beans when I’m at home) but with pre ground coffee it’s not good, so I reply on the pressurized basket for that. Crema is lacking.

(sorry Amamzon).  I am writing a review here because I feel it is important to let consumers know how a product performs over time as opposed to a new or recent purchase. The Delonghi Dedica espresso machine has been a great appliance that gets used daily for a household of two. Key features that attracted us were the small footprint that doesn't take up counter space and ease of use. We opted to have a semi automatic machine that did not use capsules. Reason being is we knew we would be using the machine regularly, and as such, the constant purchasing of capsules and that of disposing them ethically (we use as little plastic as possible) was not a decision that works for our lifestyle. Beside, the ritual of coffee making in the morning is a pleasant habit.This machine heats up fairly quickly and can produce decent espresso.  There are convenient buttons to press for either short or long shots. For us, the short option never gets used. What we've found over the years is that the amount of espresso produced on the long shot option has been reduced and the initial creaminess from when the machine was new is not there. It now just looks like concentrated coffee. The taste is still good, but then that 's due to buying quality coffee, not always the machine. Sometimes the button has to be hit a 2nd time in order to produce what should be the right amount for a long shot. We do clean our machine regularly and use filtered water, but like any small appliance that gets a lot of use, this little machine has worn with age. This minor issue doesn't alter the flavor of the end product. The frother has worked superbly since the beginning; a simple feature using the excess steam and a built in aerator making for nice cappuccinos and lattes.  WE paid around $200 two years ago, and feel the $$$ were well spent. The Delonghi Dedica  has been a good workhorse in the kitchen and when it finally bites the dust, we will be purchasing another one.",3 people found this helpful,No

Being able to control and access your steam is the secret to a great cappuccino.  I got this on special sale for about $170, though it retails a bit over $200 in most places. I use it daily, often several times.  Friends now stop in just for coffee!  I can brew directly into a standard height coffee mug, since I need the larger cup to add my foamed milk. I am able to make excellent espresso and foam my milk perfectly. It heats up for use in under a minute, so by the time I load the coffee into the filter, it is ready to brew.  It is super easy to operate, easy to clean, has an easy access water tank so you don't have to add water each time you use it.  You can buy a water filter to fit into the water tank, which is really nice. Every few months, you need to run a descale solution through the machine which is a process that takes a bit of time (about half an hour) but you don't have to be on top of it the whole time. You just tend it from time to time during the process.  I am extremely happy with this machine after four months of daily use.  It is a 15 bar pump machine, & does make a little noise with the pumps during operation, for those people who are interested in the noise of machines, but only during the brief operation and not so loud that to disturb anyone.

If it is very hard to bayonet, you have too much coffee in the basket, brush a bit off and try again.  You should not need to tamp the coffee down much at all if you use a proper very, very fine grind, just level the top an tamp lightly5) the lights turn amber (suggesting descaling) after about 90 cups or so. A pain-in-the-neck task that takes at least 30 minutes, but--having lost use of two previous machines (from other companies) and discovering that they are next to impossible to repair at all economically--I now do this regularly when prompted.Can't say why people have had trouble with the machine breaking down after a few months. Perhaps a real problem with quality control at De'Longhi or perhaps not descaled often enough, or....?  .

I make great Cortados with it. Couple things I learned:- Was glad I also bought the BlueSnail coffee tamper. Am able to compress the coffee nicely with it.- Never put the milk straight onto the frother unless you want watery milk. Use a glass and let water come out of the sprout for 2-3 seconds. Then rotate the dial slightly clockwise (facing down), exchange the glass for the milk container, then rotate the dial counter-clockwise and only steam will come out.- After each use wash the drip tray and filter with hot water and wipe the bottom of the machine (where the coffee touched it) with a wet cloth.- Unscrew the frother at least once per month and clean the inside of the frother and the plastic sprout, as shown in the manual.- Was surprised when a yellow light came on last month. Meant that I had to descale the unit. Had to buy liquid to do it.Would have given it 5 stars had I known that the container only fits, I believe, 16mg of coffee. So the coffee is weaker than produced with the larger  units that hold more coffee (18mg and possibly more).",5 people found this helpful,No

Mistake. My primary machine is a LaPavoni manual machine and gives us great results. I purchased this because it had a small footprint and looked pretty good.  The first thing that happened was that the lid on the water tank fell off and one of the tabs broke off. Then I tried to make an espresso and the machine totally botched it...and I’m an experienced espresso maker. If this is your first machine then I would pass.  I wasted quite a bit of coffee trying to get this thing figured out. If I tamped the coffee just a little too much then the machine errored out.  It is simply too finicky for a first time espresso maker. I’m pretty disappointed in this thing and would certainly not recommend it for a first time user.  I felt pretty bad after packing it up and wanting to send it back so I completely unpacked it to give it another try. When I tried it again I had leakage around the group head and it errored out again even though I only tamped it very lightly. I don’t have time to screw around with this thing to try and make a cup of espresso.  Looking at another brand.,N/A,No

(I don't use the warmer, but it's a cool perk.) Size is great - just small enough to fit on the counter easily. Water easy to fill. I was told by customer service that this comes with a 2 year warranty. Cheap to buy two more years as well (includes paper inside to mail away for it.)CONS: I wish this came with a cup for steaming. At this price point, which isn't small, you'd think you wouldn't have to. Also, why do we have to mail away for an extended warranty or registration? (You can't register this online since it was bought on Amazon. And you can't buy the extended warranty online or over the phone. You have to mail it away and wait 2-4 weeks for a response.)

The mid-range priced semiautomatic manual EC685 maker definitely is not as user-friendly and intuitive to use in comparison. Most of the major parts like the filter carrier and the filters are more difficult to use and clean, since the filter holder doesn't have the better & easy to use EC155 design.The usage of frothier for steaming milk is not as user-friendly and frequently the process leads to forming extra bubbles and over-spilling, not as straight forward as DeLonghi EC155, which is 2-times cheaper than this used discounted model I got. Given the retail price of above $300 it is just not worth.One can easily end up with not enough steamed milk, confusingly following the not user-friendly DeLonghi guide/manual and ending up with not good, frequently over-burned coffee. Also frequently the operation leads to over-boiled water and not allowing to proceed further making coffee unless you turn the machine off and wait to cool down. Even when using one of the best coffee grinder beans sold on the market today, the coffee made is of questionable quality for the price of this makerover $300 .The only thing we like about this more expensive latest model DeLonghi EC685R coffee maker is its compact look and red color as an lovely accent in our kitchen. I struggled to give this machine more than 3-stars. Since still have a hope that operating this machine longer will be able to achieve a bit better prep of our cappuccino, or latte.

Systems engineering and communications and guidance engineer, so I'm no dummy. But the instructions for setup, adjust temp specifically suck! They do not match the actually procedure, but once I figured it out (experiential intuition helps) it's not difficult to run. In addition, DON'T OVERFILL THE FILTER BASKET!  If the filter will not insert and rotate to lock, you likely have to much coffee in the basket. They should have a clearer marking. I think the baskets should have been a little deeper for both the one and two cups. You can't make it strong enough. Coffee does not come out hot enough even at the highest setting (at best that I can tell, is where I have it set).  You cannot make a double Americano, because to make even a small cup of Americano you will need to use the 2 cup basket. So the dual drip for two shots is pretty much useless.  I literally just received the unit, set it up and tried a few experiments for the first time, so I'll play with it a bit, but if I don't get any better at it, it'll go back. So far, I'm a little disappointed in De' Longhi, especially since they are Italian ... you'd think they'd be a little fussier about their espresso machines at ANY level.Think I'm close to mastering this thing. The scoop that comes with the tamper sucks, use a regular tsp. For a 2 cup, loosely fill the basket to the top edge with a fine grind (not superfine).  Lightly tamper do not over tamper. If you take the filter off after making your espresso and its ""soupy"" then you likely over tampered and the water is not flowing properly and you won't get a decent creme.  When you lightly temper and clean the edges you should end up with about 1/8th of an inch of space at the top of the basket. If you heater is like mine, it needs to be at the hottest setting.  When you master this you should have about 30% or better creme at the top of your cup and it should take a few minutes not seconds to disappear. As well, instead of soup in the basket you should end up with a puck that basically falls out.Update after the first week of use. Once we all started to master the technique of using this machine, we all have come to the conclusion (4 of us) that you can make a nice smooth velvety espresso and a really nice Americano. The trick as noted about is to A) not over grind your coffee. Fine but not Superfine!! and B) do not overfill the basket. We mostly make double cups and such its basically 2 heaping tsp  of fine Starbucks espresso (that's what we use). When you level that with your finger or a flat edge it should b just about or very close to level across the top of the filter. Then firmly tamper making sure the coffee is level and you don't have valleys. The resulting space from coffee to top of the filter should be about 1/8"" - 3/16"".  With the right grind as noted that should give you a really nice smooth espresso with a luxurious creme.",One person found this helpful,Yes

Lifting the machine revealed a wet underside.Not sure if it was the machine, or something I had done wrong, I removed the tank, cleaned the machine, dried all surfaces (including the bottom of the machine) and let the machine sit for 2 hours.  I then checked it to confirm all surfaces were still dry.  I placed it on the kitchen counter for a test run.  I filled the tank 1/2 way and clicked it into place, making sure it was well connected and sitting flush with the machine (see picture 3).  I made two double espressos.  Unfortunately I could see water seeping out from the bottom (see picture 1).  Upon turning off the machine and lifting it, I could see there was water dripping from the slits in the plastic bottom (see picture 2).  Lifting out the water tank showed there was no leakage around where the tank meets the machine (see picture 4).To do a bit more sleuthing, I turned the cleaned up the machine, kept it off, and put the tank back in.  It started to leak again.Seems like I have a defective machine, which is unfortunate.  I would love to exchange it for a working one, but the only option seems to be to return it.  Can't give a brand new espresso machine that is leaky any more than 1 star :(",3 people found this helpful,Yes

Each bean is different for the required grind. I used no name espresso bean from Walmart when I first got it, grind to super fine Espresso with my Brevel dose grinder and it worked great, but this was only till I got some nice beans, when my lavazza arrived and I did same grind, plugged that thing like no tomorrow LOL no water would push through nada might as well be a plug. had to go up to a 18 (25 is filter grind...) and now i get a decent espresso out of it, slowly moved down to a grind of 15 no lower. Im scared to change beans to try others as the waste figuring out the correct grind is terrible. the milk frother works well easy to clean, for my first espresso machine that isnt a pod enviro disaster, it is good, easy to use/clean and holding up well (had it over a month done my first descaling) If I could do it over?

One of the prime reasons for this model is it's small footprint as we do not have a lot of counter space.  Used about a month so far mostly weekends otherwise drinking our regular drip coffee.  We make mostly long black (espresso to hot water).  The portafilter is slightly on the small side and does not allow you to get a full 14 grams of coffee grounds loaded.  If you overfill then you will be unable to load in machine.  Each level scoop measure ( included ) is approx 7 grams of grounds so you need slightly less.  The scoop has a tamper on one end but would recommend a sturdy 51 mm tamper.  Obviously grind is a factor and our grinder that works well for drip can't produce fine enough grounds for  espresso.  We've gone through a pound of locally roasted and ground beans so far and enjoyed every cup.  Definitely more work than making a pot of coffee but just no comparison in flavor and well worth the effort.Did try the steaming wand/ frother in making hot chocolate for the grand kids and all worked well.,One person found this helpful,Yes
