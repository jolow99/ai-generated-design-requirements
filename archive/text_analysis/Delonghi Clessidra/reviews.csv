Smooth and bold.- Compact, aesthetically simple design- Simple controls, only 2 buttons: 1 - brew, and 2 - iced coffee mode (or pour-over if you push it twice).- Fast brewingCons:- WTF... why is the basket inside the carafe? If I wanted a pour-over, I'd use a pour-over basket and a chemex. In order to pour a cup before it's done brewing, you have to remove the carafe, and then pull out the basket from the carafe (which might have hot water in it) and then set it in the separate basket holder that I guess has to also live on your counter, then pour your cup, and then put the basket back into the carafe to put back into the coffee maker. It's... insane. Why are we going backward in usability for an already solved problem?",25 people found this helpful,Yes

This keeps the smell of grinds and any residue away from the reservoir and water flow, which by common sense would seem to keep these areas cleaner for a longer period. 2. Having to remove the grinds holder from the carafe to the external plastic holder - I don't see this as a burden, but a sensible option to contain the grinds until I am ready to dispose of them. 3. The overall design allows the reservoir itself to be easily cleaned, by simply wiping the excess water out with a clean, dry towel.The clicking sound is only a result of the machine having temporarily stopped the flow; it is not a defect. And the machine does beep when the brewing is finished.The iced coffee process works fine for me. The bottom plate warmer does not come on during iced brew mode.I only notice a slight difference in flavor when using the pour over mode, but it does take a little longer. Overall I don't feel that the Brewing process takes too long as others have stated. I do understand though that not having a timer to start a brew process for waking up in the morning could be a real negative for many.The coffee is hot - perfect in my opinion. And the warmer does keep the coffee hot.I typically do four cups by DeLonghi standards when I brew, which produces two standard mugs of java, or 20 ounces.Cons:1. The carafe is too large for the limited eighy cups that it is able to produce. This must play into the overall design, because it simply makes no sense. 2. The free flipping of the lid as you pour is a distraction and I could see it leading to a sloppy pour, though I have not experienced any spilling when I pour, but the lid overall feels abnormal compared to other lids.One positive I guess is that you don't have to touch the lid at all, because when you pour, the lid is designed to yield as the flow passes through to your cup - this is actually a clever design and I don't have a problem with it because it works. At the same time you can hold back the lid manually, but this has a different feel than other lids.3. I felt that the machine was expensive, so wait for a deal as I did.",2 people found this helpful,Yes

I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coffee the system makes.At first glance, you might look at the DeLonghi and think 'it's a coffee maker, big deal'.  I did at first.  It's a slightly different design on the basic drip coffee maker -- pour water into a reservoir, put grounds in a filter container and turn it on.  A few minutes later you have coffee in a nice glass carafe.On the surface, that's all true.  As a drip coffee maker it does what most drip coffee makers do and it does it quite well.  It isn't as compact a unit as many drip systems are that make as much or more coffee per max load, but due to the other primary function it serves -- an automatic pour over coffee maker -- that space on the counter is earned.Use of the 17270 is very simple -- Put an appropriate amount of water into the fixed position, top-placed reservoir, put a #4 cone filter into the carrier, put the appropriate amount of coffee grounds into the filter, put the carrier inside the carafe, put the carafe into the unit, and tell it to brew.  You have two options -- basic drip and pour over.The pour over mode supposedly uses a proprietary method of distributing the water around the grounds to produce a pour over experience.  I've not been swept up in the pour over phenomena myself, but to me there is a noticeable difference in the coffee produced by the drip and pour-over methods.  The pour-over seemed bolder, stronger and more flavorful (using the same beans for my tests to try and even out the playing field).  Either way produced a stronger cup than my Keurig normally does, but that isn't really a fair comparison to make because the coffee for the two machines is very different (I use a SF Bay Fog chaser pod in my Keurig that I absolutely love, here these were fresh ground beans).  So while I don't have a ton of experience with pour over, there was a definite difference in the strength and flavor between the two brewing methods.  Though it's not scientific, after my initial standard drip test, I've stuck to the pour over function for subsequent pots.Neither the standard drip nor the pour over was necessarily enough to move me to using this as my daily coffee method, however.  The final function likely is, though.I love iced coffee.  I spend quite a bit of time in the summer months cold brewing with a Toddy system to generally have a pitcher of cold-brew concentrate in my fridge I can always make a nice glass of iced coffee with, as it has always seemed silly to hot-brew coffee and then water it down by pouring it over ice immediately, and hot-brewed coffee has always made IMO an overly acidic cup of iced coffee, the flavor of which I don't particularly care for.The Delonghi takes an interesting approach to making iced coffee that I was very skeptical of at first, but the experiments have proven it out to me.  You put ice in the carafe, use less water than you normally would for a similar volume of coffee, and use the pour over setting to make the coffee.  While I was skeptical of the outcome, the results were excellent.What the system produced was a carafe of very bold, cold coffee.  To be clear, the coffee coming out of the carafe was cold, not lukewarm, which might seem obvious since it's being brewed directly onto ice, but there you have it.  Being poured over the ice didn't dilute it nearly as much as I'd feared, though I'm not 100% certain why.  Being cold, and still having ice cubes in the carafe, I didn't add any to my cup, just my normal amount of sweetening agent and creamer.  I was extremely surprised at how strong the coffee was and still flavorful, without the usual watering down I would have thought to happen had I taken hot coffee from a pot and poured it over ice (I happened to use some freshly ground Pikes Place 71 beans for this).  Without the extra ice I ordinarily might add, the watering down over the drink time wasn't present.The mid-afternoon pick me up from the initial cup out of the carafe was STRONG.  I normally wouldn't have gone back for the second full cup, but it tasted so good I did, and now I'm sure I will regret it tonight when I try to get some sleep :-).  This iced coffee experiment has likely earned it a spot on my counter.The unit also looks good sitting on the counter next to all the other family coffee paraphernalia, which doesn't hurt.One of the smaller 'attention to detail' items I find particularly awesome about the product is the inclusion of a little stand for the filter canister.  This little piece of the system was clearly thought out and demonstrates an understanding of how people do things.  The canister you put the filter and coffee into is conical since it sits right in the carafe for brewing, so when you take it out, there wouldn't be a place to put it; it can't really stand on its own as there is a covered nub on the bottom of it that controls the flow of coffee into the carafe during brewing.  Including a simple rectangular tray that the cone stands up perfectly in was simple genius.  Upon completion of brewing, you simply lift the canister out of the carafe with the attached lift handle, put it in the little plastic holder to cool, and you can pour your coffee without the used grounds and filter making a mess on the counter.  Super simple idea that massively improves the customer experience.This is one of those times I really wish for 1/2 stars in ratings because a product really needs to hit on all cylinders to earn 5 stars, and the one place this misses for me is in the initial out-of-box customer experience.  The instruction booklet is not well done at all.  In this minimalist era, it would be really nice if product documentation writers would all get together and refuse to skimp on instructions.  I mean, I realize this is a coffee maker not a rocket going to the moon, but they make such a big deal out of this being a 3 in 1 device, but the differentiation between the three modes and how to activate/use them is actually quite confusing due to the sparseness of the instructions but the constant reminder of how there are 3 modes throughout the document.  Maybe less words marketing the device I already have to me and more specifics on how to make it work?  You can figure it out, since again, it's a coffee maker not a rocket ship, but for all the attention to other details this one was a miss.",12 people found this helpful,No

But Makes Excellent Hot Water.,"My wife and I really love iced coffee, and all the drinks you can make with it, if you have a good machine that knows how to make good iced coffee. We were so excited about this being shipped and on it's way, we went out and bought all you need to make French Vanilla Iced Coffee, Iced Mocha, Iced White Chocolate Mocha, Carmel Flavored Iced Coffee, and ingredients for a few other favorite iced coffee drinks we like.  These all can be made at home with the right ingredients, and a machine that can make great tasting iced coffee.  The iced coffee is where it all starts, and if that's bad, sometimes there's not much hope for the finished drink.  Anyways, our Delonghi  3-in-1 Specialty Brewer arrived a few days ago, and being this machine is specially designed to make premium drip coffee, and iced coffee, we were expecting some great tasting cold coffee to make our favorite drinks from.  Even the product description states ""Over ice for full-bodied Coffee - a first-of-its-kind over ice feature uses a proprietary process to brew smooth, full-bodied Coffee over ice so it’s never watered down"", after reading that, I figured we were in for a treat, and excited about being able to make our own iced coffee drinks, and skip the $15 buck tab every time we head to the corner to our local coffee shop for something tasty, but expensive.  I've never used this machine before, but it's still a basic coffee machine, fill it with water, coffee in the filter, turn it on and wait.  We did that, and waited.  And waited, and waited, and waited some more.  We got nothing but boiling hot water in the top water reservoir, but it would never drip down through the filter and into the carafe.  I followed the guide to the letter (although the guide is as basic as you could get, any less, and there would be no guide).  The guide had no trouble shooting suggestions, so I found the Delonghi website, and got on a chat with customer service.  They couldn't help me so they gave me an 800 number to call.  I called, the guy was very friendly, gave me a few suggestions, and I figured the problem was about to be solved.  Got off the phone, tried his suggestions, and still, all we had was hot water.  I could have had hot water without a $150 coffee pot.  Now, 3-4 hours later, nothing to show for it, extremely frustrated, and looking at all the great tasting goodies we bought to add to our iced coffee just sitting there staring back at me, I surrendered.  I packed up our new, non functioning specialty drip and iced coffee brewer, put it in the corner where I didn't have to look at it, told my wife to grab her coat, and took her to our local coffee shop and treated her to anything she wanted.  I knew she was as disappointed as I was, and we sat there, enjoying drinks we should have been making at home, and wondered why our new Delonghi couldn't do the simplest of things, something coffee makers have been doing since someone invented a coffee maker, just drip water down into the filter.  I'm not positive, but I believe this drips the water down by simple gravity, nothing electronic forcing the water down, just falling, like rain drops, and totally dependent on gravity.  If this is how it works, and I'm assuming the force of gravity in my kitchen is the same as the rest of the world (we weren't floating around my kitchen like two astronauts that just lost gravity), we just couldn't get it.  So, overall, I hope you understand my 1 star rating.  We were not only extremely disappointed, but spent like $40 or $50 bucks buying ingredients for a multitude of different iced coffee drinks, and we still had to go to our corner coffee shop and spend another $20 bucks for iced coffee drinks.  But, the machine did make some darn good boiling hot water.  I figure we could use this for a fancy Ramen Noodle maker.  Our guests will be extremely impressed.  I have a feeling, by just dumb luck, we got a dud, and most likely the one in a thousand that wasn't working right.  I'll exchange it when I have time, and update this review when that happens.  Hopefully, at that time, I'll be telling you about the Iced Mocha I'm drinking, made from some great tasting iced coffee from my new Delonghi specialty brew machine.  Come back soon for the update!",7 people found this helpful,No

The first thing I noticed about it was the sleek, modern look of the machine.  It looks great on the kitchen counter.You can use this coffee maker for traditional drip coffee or pour over coffee.  It uses #4 (cone shaped) filters and does come with five filters.  Making coffee is simple.  You fill the water reservoir with the amount of water needed, measure grounds into the filter/cup, place the cup inside the carafe, and press either the button for drip coffee or the button for pour over coffee.  Unlike a traditional drip machine, the coffee-making process does not start immediately.  The water in the reservoir is first heated to the boiling point.  Once the correct temperature is reached, the brewing process begins.  This ultimately means it does take a bit longer to complete the brewing cycle than a typical coffee maker.The finished coffee is very good.  Very hot, smooth, rich, and delicious.  I prefer the pour over setting as this seems to produce a fuller, smoother cup of coffee.  I have not tried to make iced coffee as I don't particularly care for it so can't comment on that function.I do like the included holder for the filter basket, which makes it easy to fill the filter with coffee and gives you a convenient place to store the basket after brewing.  The machine has an auto shut-off after one hour.  It beeps to let you know the brew cycle is beginning and it beeps again when the brew cycle ends.  It does not have a clock or timer for you to set up the machine at night and wake up to finished coffee, but I prefer to grind the beans right before brewing so this isn't an issue for me.The only part of this machine that gives me trouble is the cover for the water reservoir.  It's annoyingly difficult to get it to lock into place.  Since the machine will work even if the cover isn't actually in the locked position, why make it a locking sort of lid in the first place?  A flip-open cover would have been a simpler choice.Overall, great coffee from a nice looking, mostly easy to use machine.Edited to add:  Not long after writing this review, I accidentally broke the carafe.  I contacted DeLonghi customer support to ask about buying a replacement and learned the warranty covered a replacement carafe.  I provided my shipping address and received a new carafe within a couple of weeks.  Email replies from customer service were rather slow, but overall it was a good experience and I really appreciate that the warranty covered my own clumsiness.",One person found this helpful,No

I love the process, and enjoy the time spent. However, on some mornings I just don’t have the time.The De’Longhi is a lifesaver. It makes DELICIOUS coffee. It’s like a cross between a Chemex and V60.At approximately $150 it’s also a bargain compared to a Moccamaster, and to my palette, the coffee is just as good. In fact I use the moccamaster filters. The cup is better than my old Bonivata, and my breville grind control.The golden cup setting is perfect for most beans. But really light roasts should theoretically benefit from the longer pour over setting. However, I’ve found the prices setting brings out more roasty chocolates, and less fruit.Finally…  I typically use a ratio of 1:14, (10 grams per 140ml of water)  but they say .825:14. I tried my normal 10 grams per cup and the cup lacked clarity. They’re ratio works wonderfully. Clarity, depth, and flavor.So besides taste, why purchase this?1. Even though they sell it as a place to put the basket at the end, the included stand also makes dosing beans much easier, pleasurable even, and keeps the grinds out of the carafe.2. I’ve never been able to clean the boiler of a drip machine before. I love that I can keep it clean and dry after. Descaling will be a breeze! You can even measure the temp of the water if you wanted during the brewing process.3. It’s gorgeous!A few things it doesn’t do:1. Rinse your filter. You should do that and will greatly improve your coffee flavor.2. No automatic preinfusion. But, there’s workaround! There’s an auto stop feature. So, wait for the water to boil, then just as it starts to statuette the grounds, pull out the pot, open the lid, give it a swirl, and set your timer for 45 seconds. Then close it up, and put it back in to brew!Things I don’t like:1. A lot of plastic. I’m waiting for something to break… especially the small loop that, I think is needed for the pot to release water. But hopefully there’s replacement parts available.All in all:1. Delicious coffee with clarity, complexity, and cleanliness (but not too clean), and soft mouthfeel.2. Super easy to use and keep clean.3.

   Three in one coffee pot. First I cleaned the machine by running two full cycles. The water heats in the top plastic reservoir and has a vent on top.Next, I made a pour over. It cycled very fast, not like when I do a pour over using my Chemex craft. I think of pour over as a slow drip. It was hard to tell if it was in the right setting, you have to press the button on the left then double press the one in the right. There was no light on the right button so I wasn’t sure if it was really doing a pour over or drip.The drip cycle is fairly quick, after the water heats on top. You need to make a minimum of 2 cups. I used the filter container holder when adding coffee to the filter area and then as a resting place for the filter holder after the coffee was done. The lid was quirky, when I poured coffee into a cup it just gushed out and spilled over. Will take some getting use to.Last, I made ice coffee. What are all those strange loud sounding clicks?!?! I heard at least 7-8 while it cycled. That’s annoying. The only thing is you now have to pour both coffee and ice (tricky, given my experience with the lid pouring coffee). Now if you want to add cream or sugar you have to stir it with the ice already in the glass unless you stop the ice from going into the glass. I learned that on the second try, easier to blend in extras without ice, then add fresh ice to coffee in the glass.Overall, it’s a decent machine. A few quirks and those clicks are strange and loud. The Auto shit is 60 minutes, can’t adjust it but it smells like burnt coffee after 15 minutes, it immediately shut off after the ice brew cycle. It’s versatile for families that make a variety of drinks. It’s tough, I really want to give it 4 stars, the clicks were on my last nerve so more like 3.5 stars. I settled on 3, which is average or decent give the $149 price tag.",2 people found this helpful,No

Got this one after buying two different machines costing around the same price as this and they were terrible. The design of this coffee pot is unique and stylish. I love the fact that the water container is on top and clear. It's also easily accessible for cleaning. Most people don't realize that the water tanks on their conventional machines need cleaned regularly or bacteria will grow. The poor over brewing works better because the water is being poured over through multiple holes on the Carafes lid. Most generic machines only have one tiny hole which causes poor taste and accidents when the water fills up to fast spewing your grounds into your pot of fresh coffee. This machine has never given me any such issues and the grounds are brewed equally no dry spots . I also love the fact that you can't forget the coffee grounds in the machine over night causing that horrible mildew and mold. There is a stand for the coffee ground holder which makes filling it up very easy as my coffee grinder is constantly getting moved around the kitchen. This is honestly the best coffee I have ever been able to make. The water temp is controlled for a consistent brew every time. The ability to make Iced Coffee in just minutes is amazing. No waiting forever for the coffee to cool down in the fridge. No guessing on the amount of ice or water to use. This coffee machine will probably pay for itself in no time as it brews so efficiently I don't have to use as much beans for the same strength pot as usual. Also love the fact that this pot has a heating plate and that it actually stays on after the coffee is brewed! It also automatically shuts off. The certified brewing mode is the best! It's honestly the best coffee I have ever had at home. I will never buy starbucks again.,2 people found this helpful,No

The first mode is the ""SCA Golden Cup"" which gets its own button. The second button is shared between iced coffee and the standard pour-over. To get the pour-over the button needs to be double tapped - otherwise it puts itself into iced mode.

You can begin pouring out a cup while it's still brewing (it'll stop dripping water into the carafe), but due to the design of the carafe it's very possible you'll end up pouring in some grinds along with the beverage. I recommend waiting for it to complete and remove the filter and its plastic mount before pouring.Coffee tastes great in all modes and I have no complaints there. But the design on this one could have been a little more polished given the premium price being asked.",One person found this helpful,No

Seems like I've spent my whole life trying to pour water into little spaces in coffee pots and always missing.The hot plate stays warm for 1 hour then shuts off.What I'm not crazy about is that it can only make four cups at a time. The filter/coffee fits inside the carafe so if you add more water it covers the filter. Look closely at the picture they provide, it's showing you the level of coffee you can have before it touches the filter. Each of my mugs counts as more than one cup in ounces and when everyone wants coffee, or I have company, it simply does not make enough to fill all the cups. Iced coffee has to be made in quantities of 8 cups. Too much of it, too little of hot coffee. This annoys me no end.Next, because the filter cup is inside the carafe, you have to take it out before you can pour yourself a cup. They give you this little stand to put it on. This means no sneaking coffee before all is done and, what I hate even more, something else to clean.But here's what kills it for me...there is no programming to auto start in the morning. And it's ""slow brewing"" as in slow. Call me lazy but I love auto start in the morning, I love waking to the smell, I hate standing there watching this pot slow brew.So, the fact that it won't make more than a couple of cups and has no auto start kills it for me.",One person found this helpful,No

So, we were excited to try out these specialty brews, and we were not disappointed. This brews excellent coffee. It is easy to use for all three brew types; it is basically pushing a different button for the brew you want. For iced coffee, you add ice to the pot, and the heating element does not turn on. Since this is a drip brewer, a full pot takes approximately 12-minutes to brew. I like that the water reservoir is clear, and will be easy to keep clean.

I was a little worried about this coffee brewer, especially after reading some of the reviews on it. That said, for my purposes, it works well for me and makes a fresh and tasty cuppa each and every time.There are three ways you can brew coffee with this machine - pour over, over ice, and golden cup (drip style). I've never owned a pour over style coffee machine quite like this one, so this was a new experience. It really seems to brew everything I make consistently and evenly, bringing out the flavor nicely.I like the way this makes coffee over ice where it's not watered down - something I don't like. It brews it perfectly so that it doesn't taste weak or diluted - which is icky to me and a reason why I never preferred iced coffee - until now. I can drink iced coffee the way this brews it and actually enjoy it without making a face.I love the pulsing showerhead when using the pour over method, where it evenly disperses the water over the coffee grounds and gets all of it super saturated. This seems to really make a difference in the richness of flavor, since it's utilizing all of the coffee grounds really evenly, and I'm always happy at how smooth it tastes - yum! It's like having your own personal barista hanging out in your kitchen whenever you want!The warming plate stays on for around an hour or so after brewing, which is a nice feature like a normal coffee maker has. The carafe holds 8 cups, which is a nice quantity for my household. Most of the time, I am the only one in the house using this (although my husband uses it from time to time), so I don't need an industrial sized brewer.Overall, I haven't experienced any issues with this whatsoever, and I'm pretty pleased with its performance in how it makes my coffee taste. I like having a range of methods for brewing coffee to get my caffeine fix, so this is a really nice and useful addition for me. I've had this for about a month now with no problems, so I'm relatively happy overall with it. It gets two thumbs up from this household!",One person found this helpful,No

I was interested in trying this pot, as it's definitely a different design than I've tried in the past, but I also love some cold-brew coffee.This pot is not as intuitive at first as your basic coffee pot, and the instructions aren't quite as user-friendly and thorough as I would like.  Still, I managed and got  it going.I know this coffee was supposed to knock my socks off, and it was good - don't get me wrong.  But is it worth the price point, the sacrifice of counter space, and the time?  That, I'm not sure, or at least not for my life and lifestyle.  There are some days when I don't sit down for 10+ hours, and I need coffee, STAT.  I don't have time to wait.I think that if you're shopping for people who really have the time and luxury to sit down and savor coffee - vs pouring it down their throats to survive, as I do - then this is fantastic.

   I have plenty of coffee machines but I got this because I wanted something to make ice coffee simple.  I also love De'Longhi and have found it to mean quality. I have owned their a/c units and heaters. They always seem to workout very easily and have a high tech yet simple approach to appliances.  They remind me of Dyson but actually work well.So i included the a video so that you can check out how the coffee is brewed into the ice. It doesn't pour over the ice, it instead fills up the ice. This makes it so that you don't water down the coffee as quickly and yet thoroughly chill your coffee. Its just an ingenues way of making iced coffee.I love the simple 2 button approach to making coffee. In reality you should only ever need 2 buttons. The left button turns on the machine. The right button starts the brewing process. After you press the right button, the boiler turns on and you can see your water bubble. After the correct temperature is reached, the machine lets the water pour over your grounded coffee. You can then see your coffee be released into your pot. This process usually takes about 30secs to a min to brew.",One person found this helpful,No

Also, paper cones are believed to be healthier.My only negatives are that the top is kinda awkward sometimes and that I have to de-scale frequently.I do think it will be on my counter for many, many years, and in a world of coffee makers that promise to do everything but your taxes, this one executes a few simple functions flawlessly.

In an era of complex coffee makers, the design is simple, refreshing, and elegant. It is easy to set up and after washing the carafe and running water through it to clean we were up and running.This coffee maker is fun to watch. The clear reservoir allows you to watch to the water as it heats to boiling and seeing the motion within the water as it heats is oddly relaxing. The design is simple and smart because the reservoir for the water contains the heating element. This means the entire machine is sterilized each time you make coffee, and there is no separate reservoir that you need to keep from getting gunky, which was always an annoyance with our previous machines.The coffee it makes is excellent, however to be honest we would not consider ourselves connoisseurs when it comes to different brewing methods - we just enjoy a good cup of coffee, which this delivers. We have some minor complaints, for instance the reservoir lid gets condensation from the water boiling which will drip down when you open the lid, however once you know it happens you can account for that when you open it. The other thing is we couldn't find anywhere in the manual where it said what size cone filter to use.

I can excuse most of the cons if not for the elevation issue; having a cup of coffee in the morning is, unfortunately, a coin flip when using this machine since the water occasionally boils endlessly.When it does brew successfully, the quality of the coffee is excellent. Although you don't have complete control over the pour-over process through temperature or timing options, the machine seems to handle it for you fairly well for a variety of grounds.Traditional cold brew coffee is steeped in water rather than done over ice using hot water and drip. It ends up being much stronger while still being very smooth; a unique flavor that isn't replicated here. It is, however, a fairly good approximation if you're in a pinch and don't want to steep grounds in the fridge for 24 hours. Since it manages to be a good middle-ground on account of its proprietary process, I'd consider it to be an overall positive feature.Overall, I would've happily given this product a full 4 or 5 stars if the coffee maker worked consistently",5 people found this helpful,No

As I love Tim Hortons and McDonald's iced caps, I was extremely eager to try the iced coffee feature of this 3-in-1 specialty coffee maker.It does your basic drip-style coffees but you also have the option to do your own pour-over coffee if you so desire (although I don’t get the point…) but it’s the over-ice option that stands out to me. The only downside is that you can’t make single cups of iced coffee at a time but to me, that’s not a major problem since I’m never satisfied with just one serving of iced coffee. Any extra can be frozen or kept in the fridge for later!The whole machine is about 13” high but it has a relatively small footprint. It doesn’t take up much more space when compared to my basic drip coffee maker. With the brewing water above the glass coffee carafe in an hourglass design, the coffee grounds basket actually fits inside the opening of the glass carafe and you have to remove it before pouring your coffee. There’s a basket holder included to keep it from dripping everywhere on your counter but it’s an unusual design and takes some getting used to. It’s not as convenient in my opinion.The main problem with this machine is that it’s a troublesome coffeemaker. It literally won’t work in high altitude regions and that’s not mentioned anywhere in the product description or on the packaging itself. Something like “suitable for at sea level or a maximum elevation of x,000ft only“. Seems to me that such a limitation should be cause for a disclaimer somewhere on the box or listed in the specifications so people don’t waste their time buying something that won’t work because of where they live.PROS+ Makes flavorful and rich tasting coffee in 3 different ways (drip, pour-over, or iced)+ Makes about 8 cups of coffee at a time+ Keeps coffee warm for one hour before auto-shutoff kicks inCONS- Won’t work at higher elevations.- Takes longer to brew (~11 minutes)- Glass carafe is not very thick. It seems very fragile so you must be very cautious when cleaning or moving it.- I don’t love the in-carafe basket design.- Doesn’t come with a permanent filter.

I did the usual things, pushed the buttons, looked at the manual, made sure the carafe was placed such that the trigger button (located on the arm that hold the top and bottom sections together) but nothing worked.I tried calling support and in all, over 6 calls I spent more than 10 hours on hold waiting for help.

After playing with it for 20 minutes, adjusting the altitude setting - from 1 to 5 and trying the cleaning function as well as just making coffee it suddenly worked. It sounded like the pump was trying to work but it was air locked (an air bubble can get trapped in a pump and cause it to stop moving water) and with all the messing around it must have cleared the bubble.So I got a machine that does iced coffee but what a hassle.♦ ♦ I give zero stars for the coffee machine.♦ ♦ I have to give no more than three points total considering how long I had to sit on hold waiting for someone to talk to.♦ ♦ While the new machine does work it was a hassle to get going and I cant give stars to the model shown here when what I finally got was a different machine.So there it is, a 3-star review simply because they did send a replacement machine.

He called into customer service; they elevated the call to a manager who literally asked him, ""Do you live at elevation?"" Then they had the user ship it back because IT DOESN'T WORK AT ELEVATION.I'm sorry. I didn't see that advertised by DeLonghi, and I don't see that in the fine print. I now officially have a $180 paperweight sitting on my desk. If DeLonghi comments on this review, I'll happily return it... but I'm not happy to have wasted my time having to write this.UPDATE 12/3/2020:2 months ago, De'Longhi got back to me in the comments below this review.Here's what's happened so far.De'Longhi customer service called me (which I missed due to work). They left a message saying they intended to give me a replacement unit, and they said they'd call back. I e-mailed giving a list of times that were convenient for me and were well within De'Longhi's working hours... they still didn't get back to me. I sent another e-mail. Still no call. I then called twice; once, I was hung up on while waiting for 30 minutes. The next time, I waited 15 minutes and gave up.Unfortunately, there's been no resolution to this issue, so I'm still sitting on a paperweight. I literally want to send it back; I'd really rather not get rid of the unit.",One person found this helpful,No

With the press of a button you can make drip or pour-over coffee or you can make some very refreshing iced coffee. The machine only has two buttons for these three types of coffee. There is no customization, no timer, nothing you can adjust. It's just press and go.The water reservoir is located on the top of the machine and the grounds holder sits inside the oversized carafe. This coffee maker has a bigger than average footprint, coming in at about 13"" high and 12"" wide (include handle of carafe).I find this machine to be quite noisy. It continually clicks on and off (this is due to the machine stopping the water flow while it brings the water back up to temperature as it brews). I'm also not overly keen on the ground/filter holder being inside the carafe. It is a strange design that leads to a very large carafe and a lot of wasted space in my opinion.All of these minor annoyances aside (did I mention the buttons are right next to the hot plate? I hope your eyes are fully opened when you make your first cup in the morning), this machine really does brew a nice cup or three of coffee. To my uncultured taste buds, the drip and pour-over taste essentially the same, but at least you have the option for either one. The iced coffee is also really nice, and I love that is so simple to make given that you brew the coffee right onto the ice cubes.I didn't have any issues with the water flowing from the tank into the carafe. Be sure that the carafe is full inserted into the machine and touching the button at the back as this is what turns off the safety feature.If you are looking for super simple 8-cup machine that also makes iced coffee, this is a great option for you.",One person found this helpful,No

Brown,N/A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Canada,"October 12, 2020",N/A,"At first, I wasn’t sure how to even operate this type of coffee maker. It looks a little different than the coffee makers we all grew up with. The included quick start guide makes getting your first cup of coffee brewing very simple. I got mine running within 10 minutes of opening the box. The water compartment is see-through and is on top. You can see the water bubble and come to a boil. The water is heated in that container and then makes its way over the coffee grounds and finally into the carafe. The 3-in-1 means that it can make ice-coffee, it can make drip coffee, and it can do pour over.It has the SCA gold sticker which means your water will be the exact right temperature to get the most out of your coffee beans. The carafe where your coffee eventually ends up in is located below the water container and the coffee grounds bin fits right into it. The grounds bin is designed so that when its removed from the carafe, the valve below it shuts. One of the accessories provided is a carrier for the grounds bin so when you take it out, you don’t have to just place it on the counter and make a mess – a very well thought out accessory to include. Other accessories included are a scoop, samples of the number 4 paper coffee filter.At the very bottom of the unit, there is also a heating plate that keeps your coffee warm as it’s being made. Near it are controls to turn it on/ off. When making iced coffee, you’ll want it off. When making drip or pour-over coffee, you’ll want it on.It has a safety feature that shuts off the valve from the water container to the carafe when the carafe is removed so you won’t accidentally have hot water being poured over your counter-top.Some of the downsides I found are as follows. The buttons are not the highest quality. It also makes very loud beeping sounds that’s not appropriate for an environment that needs to stay quiet.Some of the upsides I noticed are the sleek design. It fits right in with a modern kitchen with gray, black, and white tones. It looks modern with the sleek glass surfaced and curves designed into its hour-glass shape.Overall, if like me, you find yourself buying a lot of iced-coffee from Tim Hortons over the summer, I think this a worthwhile investment for your kitchen. It works well and there’s not much to complain about.",N/A,No

It has three different methods for preparing your coffee: premium drip style, pour over method using the carafe or brew over ice. I found that it produces good (not great) hot coffee but the iced coffee is the best I have ever had from an at home machine. It takes into account the amount of water that is produced from the ice so your coffee doesn’t taste watered down or weak. It also automatically turns off the heating plate so that the ice doesn’t melt. I am a huge iced coffee lover so this has been a big game changer for me, especially during Covid.The water tank holds 42 ounces and makes about 8 cups of coffee. It has a 60 minute keep warm option so your coffee stays hot while you get ready in the morning. It also features an automatic 1 hour shut off so you don’t have to second guess if you turned it off after you leave the house.The biggest issue I have with this machine is how long it takes to make a coffee. It heats up for about 5 minutes and then takes another 7 minutes or so to brew a full pot. This isn’t ideal if you have a busy lifestyle and unfortunately, it doesn’t have a timer so you can’t have a pot ready to go. I really don’t like that you have to use paper filters each time and I think it should come with a reusable filter instead. I also wish that you could buy a replacement carafe incase this one happens to break. It is made from glass and I am nervous that a bump from a mug or countertop could break it and then the machine would be useless without it.",N/A,No

I thought the design of this coffee maker looked cool and since it was 3-in-1 they could use it for themselves for hot or cold coffee.The design of it is what drew me in. I find it stunning. It is different and takes up somewhat less space. I'm not a fan of paper filters though and wish they would have had a reusable stainless steel filter for the price.As for hot coffee, I find it okay. No different than a regular drip machine. I do find that the pour over tastes better. So if you are buying it for this reason. Save your money because you can get the same or better features at about half the price or more like time setting and programming. I like my coffee really strong and I found that it was a struggle to get a good, strong cup. I have to use a lot of coffee. I've been spoiled with automatic brewers which select that for me, so for me the hot coffee didn't win me over. My sons like regular coffee and were fine with it.As for iced coffee, it was pretty good and the best cold brewer I have tried yet since the others will melt the ice a lot more and water it down. This actually takes into account the amount of water to put in with the ice so that you get a good full flavoured brew and the heating plate is off to reduce the melting.  I would recommend medium to large sized cubes so that you don't have the hot coffee that is pouring out to melt small ones and overly large ones makes it hard to pour a cup without making a mess. You can also pour the coffee on the iced coffee setting without ice, then add some cold cream or milk to it (even better if you have a frother that froths cold milk)  and/or then add in a blender with ice and make your own iced cappuccino. Add in some coffee syrup for a custom flavour.So, the star of the show here seems to be the brew over ice feature. So if you are looking for that and also a way to serve up a cup of coffee and aren't too picky about it, then this would be a good buy. For someone who is very picky about their coffee, you might find this too pricey and lacking in features to be worth it.",N/A,No

One one hand it really does brew a fabulous cup of coffee. The flavour is rich and smooth and my husband and I both really enjoy this. I enjoy iced coffee and will often make a special trip to buy it at an out-of-the-way coffee shop where I live, but I tried brewing a cup using this machine and was very pleased with the flavour as well as how bold it turned out.On the other hand I'm not sure that I would pay the full asking price of $199.99 for this coffee maker. We have a less expensive one that has more features. This maker does not have a timer that you can set ahead of time to make busy mornings better nor does it do as much as I would expect for a ""premium"" maker. Yes, the design is interesting, and it doesn't take up much room on my kitchen counter, but the price tag seems overly steep in my opinion.This is a premium coffee maker and you get what you pay for; you are paying for a great-tasting coffee. In this case that is all that you are paying for- you are not paying for the bells and whistles that other coffee makers usually come with. If you are very particular about the flavour of your coffee this may be worth investing in but if not there are less expensive models out there that come with more features.",N/A,No

Having the choice between iced coffee, drip-style coffee, or a pour-over cup of coffee is also great when you have guests over who might want their coffee done in a different way.The actual machine itself is smaller than I expected. It’s barely a foot tall and takes up very little counter space in my kitchen. I think the main reason this is smaller than I expected is because it stores and boils the water on top of the machine, so you don’t have a separate water container on the back or side taking up extra room.You do need to use paper filters with this coffee maker, which I’m personally not a fan of. I would much prefer a reusable filter that you simply wash each time, but if you want to you can just buy one yourself that fits the right size. I am happy to see that there’s an auto-shutoff feature, both to avoid burning the coffee and also as an energy-saving measure.The quick-start guide that is included is very simple to understand, with lots of pictures and clear descriptions. It walks you through everything you need to know, including how to make coffee in the three different ways in case you’ve never made some of them before. I found it very helpful for making iced coffee the first time. I found the coffee made in this machine was good, but obviously that’s heavily influenced by the kinds of grounds you use. I thought the coffee was great, but it also depends on what coffee you use and other elements.One issue I do have with this coffee maker is that it’s really not designed for speed or for single cups of coffee. The measurements on the carafe begin at 2 cups, and it takes up to 10 minutes to finish making the first batch of coffee in the morning. This isn’t a long time, but if you’re in a rush or on the way to work it can feel like a very long time to be waiting for your coffee. On top of that, if you want to make coffee in the morning it’s annoying not to have an option for a single cup of coffee, as anything else is going to be wasted unless someone else in your house will drink it.Overall, I think this coffee maker is a compact and convenient machine for most people, with my only real complaints being that it isn’t very fast and it isn’t ideal for making a single cup of coffee in the morning. For multiple people, or for the office, it’s easy to make coffee in three different ways and can even make iced coffee.",N/A,No

It takes time to heat up and if you’re like me and rushing around in the morning, a timer is key. The filter basket is inside the carafe. To some this would be okay, but I don’t love it. The basket does have a valve on it though, which closes when you lift if from the carafe so it doesn’t drip everywhere. It comes with a little tray to hold it when you’re not using it. I find it a bit awkward if you’re making a cold brew and you’re fiddling with ice and trying to fit the basket on top. It just becomes annoying. The heat plate is easy to shut off for cold brew and it also has an automatic shut off so you don’t scald your coffee. There is a button that gets pushed when the carafe is in place, and it stops the flow of water when the carafe is removed. In most machines this is a great feature because you can sneak a quick cup of coffee while its brewing, but the filter is in the way and it just doesn’t work for a quick cup.

I like that. If you don't need a timer or lots of functions this is a great choice if you can get past the price tag.It made a really good drip coffee.Now for the bad:Companies are always trying to find a way to make you pay for a cold coffee with unnecessarily complicated and expensive equipment.A real cold brew coffee doesn't need to drip and won't use hot water. Been drinking cold brew and iced coffees for as long as I can remember. You can buy a container for maybe 30 dollars here on amazon where you simply pour in your coarsely ground coffee in the inner tube surrounded by a mesh (kinda like a french press concept), fill up the container with water and leave it in the fridge for up to 24 hours. You get some of the best tasting cold brew like that. No heat. Try it.  The flavor profile is incredible. You're extracting flavor at cold temp over many hours. There's less caffeine but the flavor is so much smoother. But I digress.With the Delonghi you have to fill the carafe  with ice cubes (up to the indicated spot) and then your hot coffee drips onto the ice cubes and cools down. The result was not bad at all, but definitely not worth paying that much money for it. It's awkward having to fill the carafe with ice cubes then placing the filter with coffee back on.Oh yes, one of the drawbacks to such a simple and elegant looking coffee maker is that the filter basket sits on top of the carafe so when you want to pour a cup you must not forget to remove the basket and place it on the included basket stand.All in all, it makes good coffee, so I can't give it a bad rating, but it is not the cold brew you want, nor is it worth shelling out that kind of money for it.",N/A,No

Well, simply put, I didn't find the coffee over ice to be anything special despite the SCA certification. Sure, the coffee tasted good, but I really didn't find it warranted buying a machine compared to just double brewing and dumping the result in ice. Maybe I offended the coffee gods by saying that, but to me, I don't feel like I can really taste enough of an improvement to justify this machine for this.As for how it performs as a regular coffee maker?

It is basically a 4-cup drip brew over a tray's worth of ice, but the resulting coffee was very bold and flavourful.

Coffee is a favorite there, and they have a fantastic variety of coffee beans and terroirs for bean growing, which, combined with different roasts, makes for a huge variety of coffee.  Most Vietnamese do not drink hot coffee, but instead drink iced coffee (cà phê đá) where hot coffee is poured into a glass of ice.  Whether this led to the current popularity of cold coffee in North America I don't know, but everywhere I go around the world now, I see cold coffee (with a variety of names and preparation methods).You can make cold coffee yourself, of course, by taking a regular cup of coffee from a machine and pouring it over ice, but it's not quite the same as a cold-brewed coffee taste.  This De'Longhi Specialty Coffee Brewer looks a lot like the traditional drip coffee makers I remember as a kid, because it is!  There's a glass carafe which fits into a base plate under a coffee drip filter.  Ground coffee is put into the filter, and water added to soak through the ground beans, picking up coffee flavour along the way, then nestling in the carafe.  You can make normal hot coffee this way, but for a change, add ice cubes to the carafe and let the hot coffee cool down in the carafe, then taste. The trick is to not water down the coffee with a slow, continual drip system, but to release the water as a bulk liquid into the coffee grounds first (a specially-designed ""showerhead"" helps with this), then into the ice en masse, preserving the concentration of the coffee but letting it cool down rapidly.  The taste is quite different from simply dripping the brewed coffee over ice, which tends to water the coffee down and make for a weak taste.  Cleaning is a bit time-consuming, but everything cleans up nicely in a couple of minutes in the sink (when cooled down).If all you want is a hot cup of coffee, or coffee served over ice cubes in a glass, then you can use any drip maker. De'Longhi says this machine is more designed around the cold-coffee brew process, although for the most part it's identical to any other drip coffee maker to my eyes.  The difference here is the showerhead that releases water faster over the ground coffee, and hence more as a dump of hot coffee on the ice (if you're making cold coffee).  For regular hot coffee, this machine is great, although a bit more expensive than many competing drip coffee machines.  The twist for cold coffee is more a marketing thing: there's nothing specific about this machine for making cold coffee than any other (except the speed at which the water is released to the coffee ground).  So, if you want to try cold coffee, then this machine is probably better than the slower drip makers, although I did not do a side-by-side comparison.  I think of this machine as a fine drip coffee maker, with the ability to make a nice cold coffee as well.  For those who've tried and liked cold coffee, this machine will deliver.",N/A,No

Even on a cycle immediately following another when the machine should already be good and warmed up an 8 cup cycle takes nearly 13 minutes.  So, pour over coffee is basically making coffee the same way as most automatic coffee makers do - by pouring hot water over coffee grounds, through a filter and into a carafe/cup.  I find it a little bit funny that the machine is advertised as making pour over coffee, but truth be told, it makes the coffee just like every other automatic coffee maker - just mostly in a novel shape.  I'm not saying this is bad really, this design is better for a number of reasons... it avoids water pumps as the boiled coffee is all on top of the machine and just falls down through the grounds through gravity whereas most coffee makers boil the coffee somewhere below the shower head and pump it up through internal tubing.  That tubing is usually one of the first things to go, either getting clogged with scale or causing a leak.  The heating element is right under the water in this machine, it boils the water in the big visible reservoir (which is cool to watch, of course) and then it allows it to fall over the grinds which are actually suspended in the carafe.  Over all, I find you get coffee out of the machine that is no different than a drip brewer of equivalent general quality - but the process is novel and entertaining to watch, and I believe, should be more reliable and easier to clean over time.  So, while I do think it's a bit of a ""gimmick"" there are some real life benefits unrelated to your actual cup of coffee that make this worth considering anyway.The hardware itself seems relatively well made, though it is mostly plastic it still manages to look rather sharp on the counter and for the most part doesn't look like a cheap plastic appliance.  I noticed that during the brew cycles, for whatever reason, only 2 or three of the total of 6 holes that the hot water comes out of to ""pour over"" the grounds actually has any reasonable amount of water flowing out of it, this doesn't really seem right to me.  The machine at several points during brew cycles makes rather loud and startling ""pop"" noises.  I have to admit, it made me jump more than once and this really wasn't a very endearing property of the machine.  The carafe is a lot bigger than you would normally expect for a brewer that only makes 8 cups maximum, but it's because it has to accommodate the coffee grinds/filter inside the carafe.As usual, I find the ""over ice"" coffee a bit more hype than anything.  It's difficult to use with anything but a full 8 cup cycle because you have to measure out the amount of ice into the carafe as well as the water, separately, and is difficult to do because the markings especially for ice are not exactly precise and it only gives you the ""max"" markings for it.  I did make an attempt at the over ice setting, attempting to make only 4 cups instead of 8 by aiming for the half way points to the respecting ""max"" lines.  It turned out okay, the coffee isn't watered down but it does seem too bitter to me (I suppose it keeps it steeping in the grounds longer before opening the valve to let it drop into the carafe) as promised.  Still I can't see myself using it this way much in the future.In summary.  The machine looks nice despite being mostly plastic.  I don't feel like it produces better or worse coffee than a good traditional drip brewer, but the process is more fun to watch.  I feel like this method will likely result in an easier to maintain and longer lasting coffee maker.  Slightly less convenient than some other ""normal"" brewers, but not so much so that I would actually list it as a true negative.",N/A,No

   Unfortunately, I have more negative things to say than positive for this De'Longhi specialty coffee brewer.While it is advertised for it's award-wining SCA gold cup coffee, I am not amazed by it at all. First, I find a big flaw in the design of the machine!!->You cannot remove the water tank->The filter sits inside your carafe. So, every time after the coffee is brewed, you will need to remove the filter and then only you can pour out your coffee, unless, ground wet coffee will fall in your cup->If you only want 1 cup of coffee, you will still need to use your carafe. And, you will need to measure a cup of water, pour it into the tank. Because there is no preset buttons to make 1 cup or x ml of coffee->Multiple loud click sound comes throughout the brewing session->take super long to drip 1 cup of coffee - from boiling time to the last beep it takes roughly 7-8 minutes->Coffee is not as hot as my Ninja coffee makerThe only thing I liked about this is the cold coffee. It brews nice, undiluted coffee. Again, if you just want to make 1 cup of cold coffee, you will need to run through few trials and errors to figure out how much ice and coffee you will need.I would say save your money and look elsewhere!",N/A,No

I keep forgetting and trying to pour it with it still in there. It does at last have a stand for the filter basket so that the you remove it you have somewhere handy to set it down without it leaking onto the counter.
