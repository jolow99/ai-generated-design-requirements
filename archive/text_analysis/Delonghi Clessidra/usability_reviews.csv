0,"I'm seriously considering returning this.Pros:- Coffee tasted great. Smooth and bold.- Compact, aesthetically simple design- Simple controls, only 2 buttons: 1 - brew, and 2 - iced coffee mode (or pour-over if you push it twice).- Fast brewingCons:- WTF... why is the basket inside the carafe? If I wanted a pour-over, I'd use a pour-over basket and a chemex. In order to pour a cup before it's done brewing, you have to remove the carafe, and then pull out the basket from the carafe (which might have hot water in it) and then set it in the separate basket holder that I guess has to also live on your counter, then pour your cup, and then put the basket back into the carafe to put back into the coffee maker. It's... insane. Why are we going backward in usability for an already solved problem?","['not usability', 'not durability', 'usablity', 'durability']","[0.39835092425346375, 0.22027336061000824, 0.19830945134162903, 0.1830662339925766]"
1,"Amazon sent us a second unit after the first unit just boiled water in the top part of the machine and never moved the water into the brewer basket/carafe. The second had the same problem, water boils for about twenty minutes without pouring into the carafe, then the unit shuts itself off. We suspect that the problem is because we love at a high elevation-this should be listed in the product description if it is the problem. We are bummed because it is such a beautiful highly rated machine.","['not durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'durability']","[0.5052427053451538, 0.17844149470329285, 0.1628057211637497, 0.15351012349128723]"
2,"I like the idea of the unconventional placement of the grinds holder sitting in the carafe. 1. This keeps the smell of grinds and any residue away from the reservoir and water flow, which by common sense would seem to keep these areas cleaner for a longer period. 2. Having to remove the grinds holder from the carafe to the external plastic holder - I don't see this as a burden, but a sensible option to contain the grinds until I am ready to dispose of them. 3. The overall design allows the reservoir itself to be easily cleaned, by simply wiping the excess water out with a clean, dry towel.The clicking sound is only a result of the machine having temporarily stopped the flow; it is not a defect. And the machine does beep when the brewing is finished.The iced coffee process works fine for me. The bottom plate warmer does not come on during iced brew mode.I only notice a slight difference in flavor when using the pour over mode, but it does take a little longer. Overall I don't feel that the Brewing process takes too long as others have stated. I do understand though that not having a timer to start a brew process for waking up in the morning could be a real negative for many.The coffee is hot - perfect in my opinion. And the warmer does keep the coffee hot.I typically do four cups by DeLonghi standards when I brew, which produces two standard mugs of java, or 20 ounces.Cons:1. The carafe is too large for the limited eighy cups that it is able to produce. This must play into the overall design, because it simply makes no sense. 2. The free flipping of the lid as you pour is a distraction and I could see it leading to a sloppy pour, though I have not experienced any spilling when I pour, but the lid overall feels abnormal compared to other lids.One positive I guess is that you don't have to touch the lid at all, because when you pour, the lid is designed to yield as the flow passes through to your cup - this is actually a clever design and I don't have a problem with it because it works. At the same time you can hold back the lid manually, but this has a different feel than other lids.3. I felt that the machine was expensive, so wait for a deal as I did.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.2764936089515686, 0.25935542583465576, 0.23263239860534668, 0.23151855170726776]"

4,"I've had this for a little over a month and when it works it does produce a great cup of coffee. Like others I have trouble with the water, it releases but it never comes out all 5 of the holes of the brew head. At best 3 of them work, at worst only 1. This affects taste tremendously. I'm in Fl so it isn't an elevation issue. I emailed support but they told me to call so maybe after Christmas I'll reach out. It makes better coffee than the $30 one I had before and is fun to look at but for $120 when the novelty of the design wears off you're left with an expensive, temperamental machine & regret.","['not durability', 'durability', 'usablity', 'not usability']","[0.40056905150413513, 0.2537775933742523, 0.21979400515556335, 0.1258593648672104]"
5,"It looks elegant.It's easy to use, and it provides 3 types of flavour, pour over, dropping and ice coffee.It's easy to clean.

6,"The mold that came with this brand new coffee maker was rather off-putting, to say the least. Clearly, someone used this, ""cleaned"" it, packed it back up, returned it, and Amazon relisted it as ""new"".  So, if there is only one coffee maker like this available when you go to purchase, know that it's been to two households already.  Though we decided against trying it out before returning it, so it's only been used at one household.  I'd pay the same price else at a more reputable seller, as it looks and feels like a quality coffee maker.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'usablity', 'durability']","[0.4403812289237976, 0.31059789657592773, 0.1481468230485916, 0.10087411850690842]"

9,"It works well, I like the coffee that it makes. The pour-over mode is a slower process and does have a stronger flavor.As others have mentioned, I would have liked it to keep warm fora little longer than an hour. 90 minutes would have done for me.The one baffling design decision was to put 2 buttons on a device that supports 3 different brewing modes. You won't believe how you select the 3rd mode (which is pour-over).Anyway, if you're thinking of buying this, you'll probably be happy with it.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.6479237079620361, 0.2665267288684845, 0.046052686870098114, 0.03949692100286484]"
