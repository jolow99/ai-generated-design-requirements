0,"Updating this review (original below). Down ranking from 5 to 1 starsWhile this machine made a great cup of coffee it didn't hold up. After I was half way through the introductory coffees and two sleeves of Nicaragua coffee I got an orange light instead of the white light to brew. Read the instructions said it needed to be de-scaled/cleaned. Ran the cleaner through it following the instructions and water after.Made one cup of coffee (more than an hour after I wanted it). Not good to begin with. Week later went to make another cup off coffee, same problem. There is no way minerals built up after just one coffee. I think the system has a problem with its sensors. Another two weeks, same problem. I have neither the time nor the money to de-scale between every single cup of coffee. Definitely a problem. Really disappointing because the coffee was great. I have an older Nespresso machine I still use a few days a week just for a regular single shot espresso and it has never had a single problem EVER. This deserves 0 stars at this point.Original reviewFirst, I have an older Nespresso which I've enjoyed using for a couple of years. I'm delighted to now have this newer machine which makes both espresso and ""American"" coffee. s. In addition to being a two purpose (espresso and regular coffee) machine and saving counter space, it has significant improvements.First, the water tank is much larger than the espresso only machine. If filled to capacity it makes dozens of espresso or espresso + coffee for about a week (assuming 1-2 per day). Second, it is easier to remove, fill and replace the tank than older machines. The clear tank makes it easy to see how much water is left at glance before brewing. Nespresso sells capsules of different sizes. The sizes vary the amount of coffee and kind of coffee from espresso single shots, to double shots, to short coffee, tall coffee, and what I'd call extra tall which is to fill a to go coffee mug. Accordingly the cup stand can be set at a height for espresso cup lower for a ""coffee"" cup, lower still for a mug, or finally just removed to sit a to go mug on the counter. This flexibility is great and is enough for me to retire my Krups K-cup maker to the basement. The pod is easily removed and dumped into a tank which you can remove from the side to recycle the pods when full. The design holds about a weeks worth of pods and has a drip tray so the coffee in the pods can drip dry and not grow anything you wouldn't want in the kitchen.The machine does support Bluetooth, but on consulting with the company I heard that it only works with Nexus and iPhone. I have LG and Pixel phones and was unable to bluetooth pair the phone. As it turns out the only reason to pair it is to upgrade the software on the machine. The only reason to upgrade would be for problems with the machine, for which there are no known problems and there have been no upgrades. To me then this seems un-necessary and I don't see why they market it with Bluetooth with such limited support. But no harm caused.Now let's talk about the coffee. First, the coffees provided in the samples and which I've since purchased and incredibly high quality. Second, the machine does brew the perfect cup every time. The temperature is just right and every cup has a crisp crema which varies depending on the coffee. Mixing coffee with air adds incredibly to the taste experience and they've gotten it just right.I did actually break open one of the Vertuo capsules (Solelio). I then brewed the Solelio in an Aeropress. I was literally impressed. Certainly one of the top 3-5 coffee's I've ever tasted. Honestly, I liked the taste when brewed with the Aeropress better than brewing with the machine. But neither I nor more of us have the time to hand brew coffee every day, so I save that for slower weekends. But I do share the story with you because it is a testament to the coffee quality.Overall it is a great machine. The price for capsules is comparable to competitive products, but with a choice of types of coffee (espresso or regular) and quality I think this is a better machine than the k-cup machines.","['not durability', 'durability', 'not usability', 'usablity']","[0.2818983793258667, 0.2523203492164612, 0.23889897763729095, 0.22688226401805878]"
1,"Been using it for 3 days, all was good until this morning. The machine leaked so much that it was sitting in a puddle of water.This is the third defective De’Longhi Nespresso machine I buy in the span of 2 months. First I got the Vertuoplus Deluxe, which started leaking within 2 weeks. Returned it and replaced it with the same model. Leaked again. By this time my stash of coffee pods had grown so I thought I’d stick with the same brand but try a different model (this one). Leaked again :(","['not durability', 'not usability', 'usablity', 'durability']","[0.704247772693634, 0.16831934452056885, 0.06569622457027435, 0.06173669919371605]"
2,"where should I start,i am a long time nespresso coffee user, have the original , and a 1st gen vertuoline.like both very much. they don't break, and serve the purpose. the 1st gen vertuoline was considered the premium version and is very solid built.when I see the vertuo  next on sale I think its time for some upgrad.I am wrong.1st , this unit is cheaply made, yes it is 45% recycle material, but the pod head touches and feels much much cheaper compare to the 1st gen vertuoline.  the water tank has a lid which is not even connected to the tank, maybe trying to save few cents for the connector? the bottom hole of tank feels cheap too, I believe thats why there are so many leaking issues for the newer version unit. Which, the 1st gen uses much better material  and you know it will last.2nd, the cup holder , 100% plastic. I am fine with plastic, my original line is made of plastic too but its wide and sit tight on the base. For this unit  when I  have a full cup of coffee sitting on that tray I don't feel secure at all.  can Nespresso at least spend few more bucks and make it solid?3nd, the coffee. i used a espresso pod, and half of the coffee leaked to the dripping tray........ I have been using nespresso for years and believe i know how to use the unit. clearly there is some leaking issue on the head.4th, when I got here i don't feel like using those wifi, bluetooth fancy stuff anymore. I  logged online, and press the return button.Nespresso, people like your products. the nespresso coffee machine use to be well built , but not anymore. Huge mistake.I understand the profit mainly must be from the pod, not from the machine itself. but that is not an excuse to produce such cheap products in hoping of more people to buy your pod and make money.in short term yes you will see positive pnl, long term its suicide.Nespresso need to hire people that loves and enjoys spending time with coffee and machines, to be their product manger.Not someone from wall st which the only thing they know is pnl and profit chart.btw it is very unfortunate that  i am from NYC and work for banking, thus i know its very common for such strategy to be made.","['not durability', 'durability', 'not usability', 'usablity']","[0.26877450942993164, 0.24980252981185913, 0.24153611063957214, 0.23988685011863708]"
3,"I love Nespresso coffee, when my old VirtuoPlus bit the dust I decided I needed a new machine ASAP. It makes a great cup of coffee but buyer beware, there are non-coffee related human-machine interface related issues. I was a little surprised to realize the top is mechanical, not automated like my previous machine. I’m used to hitting a button and having the top buzz open, so the manual top feels kludgy and breakable to me.And then this is no surprise, but the app is terrible, and I can’t get the Bluetooth to work, a technology that millions of devices use seamlessly every day. Their tech support is overwhelmed, so chat is shut down and if you call you will just sit on hold forever.So to sum up, if you want great Nespresso coffee in a relatively small space, this is a good option. If you want bells and whistles, buy a more expensive machine that has the fancy automatic buttons, and if you want the connected coffee maker, I don’t know what to tell you.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.3527470529079437, 0.33381950855255127, 0.15719155967235565, 0.15624196827411652]"
4,Buyer beware. I was sent a used Vertuo. Very disappointed with what I paid. Brand new one is the same price. When I opened the package there were coffee grounds everywhere. Used cups still inside the bin and coffee stains on the machine.

   I have been wanting a nespresso machine for a very long time and always thought they were too expensive. I came across this machine and it came with frother and 3 sleeves of pods for $120 so I went ahead and got it and it was the best purchase I have ever made! I love Starbucks lattes and speciality coffee so a nespresso is ideal for me. I haven’t even thought about Starbucks since I got it. I see there are a lot of issues with the app, I however did not have any so far. I have had it about a month now. It’s really easy to order pods and recycle bags from the app! The milk frother is what takes your coffee to the next level. I love to put flavored creamer in it, it is heavenly. Easy to operate and not a super bulky machine. Also works excellent for iced lattes as well. I look forward to my morning coffee even more now, and prefer it to Starbucks any time. If you have been thinking about getting it, do it. You will not regret.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.4303150773048401, 0.27621379494667053, 0.15163221955299377, 0.14183898270130157]"
6,"I had high hopes for this machine based on other reviews.  Some did say that the coffee was warm but never hit as it should be. I thought, how bad can it be? Well, the coffee was a touch hotter than warm but not hot.Also, the taste was very disappointing.  This is the main reason why I sent the machine back. Most coffees are way too watered down and others (espressos wanna be) try hard and they come close to the real thing but not quite and again, the “espresso” was warm but hot as expected.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.5295348167419434, 0.3346690237522125, 0.07543051987886429, 0.060365624725818634]"
7,"So, strangely enough I originally found this model while on Youtube. There were several videos posted by Nespresso of this exact machine (all uploaded within the last 30 days) but in the comments Nespresso stated that there wasn't a release date in the US for this particular machine yet. So of course I was surprised when I found this exact machine here on Amazon. I was a little skeptical and fearful that I would be sent something inauthentic but took the risk knowing I could return if that was the case. I really like this slimmer design and the color which is why I never pulled the trigger on any of their other models. I should also mention that this is my very first Nespresso purchase ever. I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up and turned out to be everything it said it was and more. It's a wonderful machine so far. The coffee and espresso comes out perfectly hot. The machine warms up extremely fast and the frother is magic. Seriously I have zero complaints thus far. I will update in the future if anything changes but for now I am very pleased.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.5194010138511658, 0.3982430696487427, 0.045811448246240616, 0.03654446080327034]"
8,"Man, I wish I could return this hunk of junk. I bought this right before I moved to Taiwan. I would return it in a heartbeat if I could. Basically, it is the most dysfunctional product I have ever bought probably, especially at this price. Half the time when I put in a pod, it will not turn on, so I waste a pod trying to figure out why it will not run. When it does run, for some reason, it does not stop, even when I press the button. Water leaks everywhere. It worked a few times when I first started using it, and now it is horrible. I spend 20 minutes trying to make coffee in the morning. Sometimes it comes out as sad watery coffee. When I do get crema, it is sad crema.  Worst of all, I can’t return it because I’m in Taiwan. And they don’t sell the vertuo pods here.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'usablity', 'durability']","[0.4976271092891693, 0.39815041422843933, 0.05246409773826599, 0.05175832659006119]"
9,"At first, Machine seems so simple. But it requires a lot of care.  I learned from first Nespresso agent you are supposed to clean the machine , a 7 minute procedure, 2 x a week ( this is not in their literature) and with HOT water ( also not in the literature). Also, after making coffee you needed to open machine after 5 seconds and leave it open ( Not in the literature.)  Otherwise is clogs up with coffee grinds and the machine does not work.  Second Nespresso agent told us we only need to run the cleaning once a month.... not sure  which is right .We got this machine 6 weeks ago and initially loved it. However, it stopped working twice and nespresso customer service is near impossible to reach. Spent 30 minutes waiting on hold, 30 minutes talking to them two days ago. Machine appeared to work afterwards after they helped reprogram it. then next day there was a new issue with hardware: we had to force it open and closed. Another 1 hour spent on phone. This time we tried calling amazon, who after 20 minutes connected us to Nespresso ( and we were again on hold for them.)  Another long process usinga toothbrush, toothpick, paper towel and to clean machine  .  We are supposed to repeat this process once a month ( not in literature. )Yes, making coffee is simple but  the time you need to spend maintaining machine offsets it.  two separate people  at Nespresso were very helpful  and nice if you like talking to people for a LONG time.Bought this machine for simplicity making occasional single cups of coffee. Not so simple., We also own a 10 year old delonghi magnifica espresso machine that we've never had an issue with! And it makes better coffee. I guess we are going back to that!","['durability', 'not durability', 'not usability', 'usablity']","[0.26470330357551575, 0.25653961300849915, 0.24126431345939636, 0.23749278485774994]"
