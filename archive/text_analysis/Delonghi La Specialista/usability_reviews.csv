0,"This new espresso machine from De'Longhi is obviously meant to compete with the Breville Barista Express, which has been the #1 selling espresso machine for a while.  The price and features are very similar.  However, the Breville has more settings than the De'Longhi (For example, the Breville has 18 grind settings while the De'Longhi only has 8).  Also, the De'Longhi only comes with pressurized portafilter baskets while the Breville comes with both pressurized and non-pressurized ones.  Why does that matter?  With a pressurized portafilter basket, it's easier to make espresso that tastes the way you expect even if your grind size or extraction times are not perfect.  With a non-pressurized basket, the grind size and extraction time need to be almost perfect in order for the espresso shot to taste good.  But it takes a lot of time and practice to achieve the ""perfect shot"".  If you are a beginner and want to make espresso that tastes good without too much effort, the De'Longhi is probably the better machine for you.  But if you are willing to spend the time to improve your skills and you want a machine that has more adjustments and options, then I would go with the Breville.  But you can make great-tasting espresso with either machine.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.5471737384796143, 0.2869921922683716, 0.08549758791923523, 0.08033641427755356]"
1,"I am blown away at the quality of this machine.  We got is on sale at a rediculous price, but even at list $800 this is a great deal.  The built in burr grinder is quiet and grinds to a perfect espresso consistency.  The tamper is nice and heavy- near commercial grade, as is the portafilter and milk decanter.This thing makes perfect espresso, indistinguishable from what you”d get in a shop, and looks great on the counter.The front of the machine has buttons/dials for the following:Dose level dial: used for different bean roast levelsSingle shot/double shot buttonOk button: to start espressoTemp button: to toggle 3 brewing temperaturesDual for: espresso, americano, hot waterButton for steamer/frothierIt’s very intuitive and easy to use.  We LOVE it.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.4867909848690033, 0.42647653818130493, 0.05066452547907829, 0.036067962646484375]"
2,"I had been using a manual ROK Espresso machine for a few years, and was generally pleased with the results. When I got this machine and tasted the first espresso it made, using the exact same beans I had been using with the ROK, it was like night and day. The flavor was far more complex, long lasting, and magical. It was like going from grape juice to $100 wine - I'm not exaggerating. I have since started making Latte's and have surprised myself with the amount of perfect froth I can make - it reminds of when I worked at a giant tech company's office and used their $3500 machine. I'm already doing artwork with it, it's so perfect. So I could not be happier with this machine - also it's so compact that it fits on top of my small freezer. This allows me to have the milk wand hang over the edge of the freezer. Some people have commented that the wand is placed such that it is difficult to pull the pitcher away - but this solves that - not sure it's really a problem either as I haven't tried it on a countertop. I am not an espresso expert, but I have been following the guidelines for grinding and dosing, and have gotten excellent results with both dark (Illy) and medium (Lavazza) roast beans so far.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.418975830078125, 0.41586822271347046, 0.08633468300104141, 0.07882123440504074]"
3,"I was sad when my last DeLonghi broke (after many years of regular use). I toyed with cheating on them and trying another company but I’m so glad I didn’t. I’m not a huge coffee snob, so I might not be the best judge, but I love the grinder and the ease of use. It is ready to go quickly and easy to control the mess after you’ve done it a couple times. Fresh espresso waft is wonderful.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.48423027992248535, 0.3642197847366333, 0.10340682417154312, 0.048143159598112106]"

As they deceive the buyers, NEITHER IS THE BRAND, NOR ANY OTHER DELIVERS THE TEMPERATURE THAT THEY SAY TO HAVE TO EXTRACTION (198 degrees F to 200 degrees F) A GOOD Espresso COFFEE, I have already checked several brands and IT DOES NOT GO FROM 146 degrees to 150 degrees F, EVERYTHING IS NOT MORE THAN PURE PROPAGANDA TO SELL YOUR PRODUCTS","['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.7308937311172485, 0.11970771104097366, 0.0846080556511879, 0.06479044258594513]"
5,"I have been in the habit of drinking 2 large mugs of coffee every morning for several years.  I bought this espresso machine to replace my $20 percolator that finally stopped working after over 5 years of daily use.  I read the product manual to learn how to draw espresso shots.  The espresso had a strong flavor, and the steam wand made nice frothy milk, but the drinks did not seem very caffeinated, even after I played with the settings, and I found I had to drink 5 double shots of espresso to come close to the caffeine of my 2 mugs of coffee.  This turned into a considerable time investment, as it is much more work to draw espresso shots then it is to brew a cup of percolated coffee.  But the lattes tasted really good, so I persevered.  After just a day under 3 weeks of daily use, the grinder stopped working.  I read up and determined that this was most likely due to a clog.  I watched a video in which someone easily removed the bean container to clean out the grinder, but my bean container was stuck, and I was unable to remove it, and neither were 2 other people who tried to help me with it, and it seemed like applying any more force would cause more damage.  As such I am returning this product, and I have invested in a new percolator.  I will not invest in another home espresso machine after this.  I need my morning coffee, but I can live without the hassle and unreliability of an espresso machine.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.35278424620628357, 0.24309688806533813, 0.22167690098285675, 0.18244196474552155]"

7,"Haven't bought a single cup from Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts ever since we purchased this espresso machine. It took a few tries to calibrate the grounds but once that was set, it was all smooth sailing. The tamper has a good weight to it, and although the tapping mat was a little small, it was all you needed anyway. True that the only drawback was that it was hard to remove beans from the grinder since it was built-in but it didn't really bother me much since we've been using the same kind for a while now and we just refill when it was empty.We got it at a reasonable price from Treasure Truck.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.6544449329376221, 0.30093783140182495, 0.026199407875537872, 0.018417809158563614]"
8,"Followed the start up instructions, including the YouTube video where it says to run 4 espressos before drinking your first one.It's took flushing almost the whole thing with water, plus 5 additional espressos before that plastic taste began to subside....or maybe I'm just used to it now. Kinda of like a smelly car.  Will update later.  Got this for a steal so for the price well probably keep it.  It looks good too.Wish it didn't have to plastic piece in the portafilter.What I'm gathering is this is very much an entry level Espresso Machine. And I'm probably just suffering entry level stuff.If I get into this I'll probably get a Rocket. If there wasn't this plastic taste I'd of considered Delonghi, but they're out of contention now","['usablity', 'not durability', 'durability', 'not usability']","[0.499532014131546, 0.1719839721918106, 0.17017824947834015, 0.15830585360527039]"
9,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Perfect grind every time and delivers the perfect espresso shot. My favorite feature is being able to just turn the dial and press OK for a great americano to start my day. The only issue I see is the hopper does not come off. If you like to switch beans regularly, this may be an issue. I tend to just use espresso beans and not switch, so this issue does not bother me at all. Very happy with my machine after 2 months use.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.47138160467147827, 0.3559744358062744, 0.11272791773080826, 0.05991608276963234]"
