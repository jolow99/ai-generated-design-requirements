0,yeah that grinder is loud but i imagine it is not any louder than my burr grinder,not really most are all about the same,thank you,would you recommend this machine over the lattago 5400,hmmmm tough one on warranty alone yes the eletta feel a little old school with the interface but a great workhorse for home,start making coffee at 3 17,can i know if this coffee machine allow manual milk frothing through the hot water wand meaning allow the steam to go out from the wand,no unfortunately you can not you would have to stick with the milk container system for milk drink,i am in canada and in process of buying a automatic machine shortly since this is basically an older machine now i believe what is your opinion on it v the new philip 5400 latte go when both are the same price at dollar1399 can i realize the philip ha more coffee option but a far a extraction are they equal overall or doe one excel here second which is overall easier to clean w the milk system and last which ha the longer standard factory warranty need to order shortly our last choice is a jura ena 8 but unsure if we really need to spend that much,they are both good machine we did a review of the 5400 on our channel but it wont be here till may been delayed so if you need one soon you are out of luck with that model extraction is about the same the philip is easier to clean but the delonghi not too hard either a for warranty delonghi win 2 1 year so three year that to me is the best selling point a for the ena 8 great for espresso but tough to get a good long coffee,could you do a review of the delonghi primadonna elite experience unboxing please most importantly how hot are the latte and cappuccino that come from the lettecreama system,once we get access to one we will,you prefer it over your wife do not let her hear that,i wa expecting to have compare between both and surprisingly wa just review of the black one without to give the minus and the plus with the white machine,they are exactly the same differ colour,how would you make an americano with this,mrsporkster what do you mean,you would not,will it do just hot milk for cocoa,doe this machine can make hot chocolate,no it doe not,so is it worth the 2k usd,jesus christ 2k in sweden it is at 500 dollar right now,it is on sale quite a bit,i just order the white one,i hardly comment on video but for the consumer i thought it should be my duty to write something to date my delonghi eletta ha done 3 352 coffee and going strong it is reliable simple and coffee are always hot it doe not look like the design ha changed too much so believe they have done a good job on the design cleaning is easy slim a to not take too much bench space the rinsing when you turn it on and off annoys the shit out of me but that is about it you can set the coffee the way you like it which is what i do but the overall feature are nice overall i think it a good buy hope this help anyone looking into buying a good coffee machine written by an australian coffee drinker,stuff it im getting one,hi you say this isnt your favorit espresso machine im looking for a full automatique espresso machine what is your suggestion thx you,susan cordeiro that super load grinder stopped me buying this,he say overall great machine a little big on the counter so keep that in mind aesthetically not my favourite looking machine but it is a nice i actually prefer it in the white he also said loud grinder nice crema great value lot of feature cleaning functionality for milk is great easy not much work cappuccino in under a minute with various strength and temperature sounded like to me he wa pleased overall with the performance,doe that machiene make cappuccino hot enough thanx in advance,it doe not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2,i like almost everything about this brewer my previous one wa a keurig 2 0 mybest kitchen and had a lot of issue this one is more basic but all the important feature are there if i had to name something i found a a negative it would be the size of the water tank i wa used to a larger one and have to fill this one daily a we drink 4 large cup every morning but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of thing,that is awesome thank you for your feedback,allo tu peux ajuster ta mouture avec le cadran dans la bo te grain toujours faire de ajustements le moulin en marche,can i save my own coffee,yes it is called amy coffee and you can set the amount of water that is added to the pure shot,this or dinamica plus which is better,my concern hot water plastic cancer,i have had 3 of these in three location for about 2 year they probably make 1500 2500 drink a year so far solid and really i like them better than any of the jura is i have owned better espresso drink and easier to clean,interesting i wa holding out for a jura but you say this is better,thank you for your feedback all the best,just bought this wow fantastic machine wonderful coffee can not recommend enough,thanks for your feedback enjoy,what are the dimension of this unit what would be considered a sharp price for this unit,hello how do you make espresso with this machine what setting and grinder setting would you recommend,jean yu in general to set the coffee machine normally you need to set up espresso first i have the same model grinder adjustment should be 1 9 then you should choose extra mild taste and here you go then press a short coffee,jean yu thank you for your feedback to be honest i do not drink espresso i only drink cappuccino and i have not tried that yet try the setting you mentioned and let me know,wy by adam lash thank you i am referring to espresso coffee without milk in the setting should i just select standard coffee standard taste and 1 cup for single shot,making hot drink using the milk menu a well a the coffee described above the machine automatically make milk hot milk caffelatte espresso macchiato and my milk customisable to make one of these hot drink proceed a follows 1 fill the milk container and attach it a described above 2 turn the froth adjustment dial on the milk container lid to the position corresponding to the required froth 3 press the milk menu button 4 press lt or gt until the required drink is displayed milk caffelatte espresso macchiato or my milk 5 press the ok button to start making the drink 6 after a few second frothed milk is delivered from the milk spout into the cup below for drink with coffee the machine automatically make the coffee after delivering the milk,check out the user manual here,wait what it say 120v but no 120v country ha 50hz electricity why doe it have a british plug is it a 230v version,wy by adam lash eu plug have a protective metal piece it is called the schutz kontakt schuko plug because of the top and bottom pe contact if i spelled it right look closer at the type e and f plug e ha an earth pin all socket are required to be equipped with the circuit protective conductor,this is the middle east version i live in dubai i guess it would be similar to the british standard all our plug here have three prong unlike the u russia and europe it is actually better because it is safer than the two prong the main difference between a two prong outlet and a three prong outlet is that a three prong outlet ha a ground wire while a two prong outlet doe not a ground wire is basically a wire that act a a shortcut and directs any surge of excess electricity to safely flow into the ground,doe this model have the automatic turn on time like say i can set it to turn on and warm at 6am,of course you can adjust through auto start for more information visit,uh oh loud is too reminiscent of cheap loud amp cheap sounding machine evoke untimely mechanical breakdown and dreaded nightmare repair i will take the delicious caffeine buzz all day but nix this buzz saw machinery,annette ryan yes what le noisy machine u recommend i have tinnitus so i find mine too noisy delonghi autentica,annette ryan grow up,cheap that must be a joke lol i do not know why you think this break down easily with nightmarish repair,nice video i am very impressed with it,all thanks to you man,feel like having our own coffee shop at home,mmmmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,i agree super helpful and much appreciated review,i like almost everything about this brewer my previous one wa a keurig 2 0 mybest kitchen and had a lot of issue this one is more basic but all the important feature are there if i had to name something i found a a negative it would be the size of the water tank i wa used to a larger one and have to fill this one daily a we drink 4 large cup every morning but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of thing,how would you compare this to the perfecta esam 5600 s,good how do you change from espresso bean to regular coffee bean tia,i have been on the fence about which machine to get so this video wa super helpful to me the eletta cappuccino top wa in my shortlist have not seen your channel before but will definitely be watching more of your vids very refreshing to have concise and informative content without all the unnecessary waffle thanks again and keep up the great work,do u use milk powder for milk,can the manual steamed milk be used for making latte art or perhaps using the frothed milk from the lattecrema,i do not know if i can trust an ad where they do not include a black and white dramatization bit where an actor us a fryer pan to make espresso,is the grinder a loud a the previous model that wa a big turn off for me,is this machine stainless,it is a combination of painted plastic chrome plating and metal throughout the body from personal experience it is one of the nicest looking machine in the market liam,hi great video what would you recommend this model over the dinamica model which are the difference,very good question the eletta is my personal favourite between the two a it seems to be capable of reaching a finer grind size for stronger espresso shot this is especially useful for milk based drink or straight espresso the dinamica machine have better tasting long coffee and also have a very well executed iced coffee function some of the newer dinamica machine the dinamica lattecrema and dinamica plus have better programability for user presets and advanced milk drink customization in the end it is up to personal preference liam,hello how do you make espresso with this machine what setting and grinder setting would you recommend,home coffee solution i have the same machine but i do not have the espresso double shot or single shot option on mine,espresso shot are easy with a one button push on the top interface you can select either isingle shot or wouldouble shot and program the dosage i would personally recommend starting at the 5 setting on the grinder and adjust the grind size to taste grind size largely depends on the coffee being used coarser grind le bitter more sour finer grind more bitter le sour each coffee ha a isweet spot but fairly easy to reach with a super automatic machine that is built to improve shot consistency liam,superb review,doe this machine make ice coffee,yes just need to brew an extra strong espresso shot over ice,i looked on your site and you are sold out of the silver and i am not in canada anyway i do not see silver available anywhere and it is not on the delonghi website either is it still available and is the silver front plastic like the other color or is it metal,home coffee solution thank you for the reply i actually purchased a silver one from the delonghi website and love it over the year i have had 2 jura and 2 saeco super automatic and this is by far the best the quality of the coffee is great and it is very easy to clean very happy with it thank you for providing such a great review,we are based in canada not sure what the current availability look like in the united state at the moment the silver version is mostly plastic but a few of the chrome accent seem to be metal overall the build quality is great compared to all the other machine in it price range,picked up this unit two week ago on sale for 1400 bottom line there is not another machine in this price range that offer auto froth and frothing wand two boiler great heating cup warmer on top we are still playing with the personal setting but honestly the setting right out of the box were great drink are hot even on the medium setting foam from the auto frother is great allowing you to choose how much froth you want the user interface is fairly simple oh and the clean up is stupid easy contrary to some other brand that require pill and special basin etc this frother only requires you to turn the knob to clean and with 10 second it is done remove the milk canister and put it in fridge until needed honestly i really can not find any fault with this machine we will see how it hold up to daily use,sarah teunissen hi it wa purchased at the linen chest they still had them on sale a few month ago ftr i am about 8 month out since getting it it is performed perfectly and both my wife and i love it,where did you purchase it for that deal thanks,how many gram of coffee in extra strong,the video wa very interesting i enjoy espresso every day with delonghi is magnifica s i also subscribed to the channel please come visit me on my channel with love from japan,can you tell me how i clean the steamer after steam,a simple purge running the steaming wand without milk and a quick wipe off with a towel with suffice for basic cleaning i would recommend removing the plastic cover every couple of week and using soap and water to more thoroughly clean out the component steam is a natural sanitizer so any remaining residue will likely be baked on sugar,hi nice video how doe this machine compare to the newer dinamica w lattecrema waffling between the two now that the price on the eletta gop ha come way down in pric,the eletta can go to a finer grind size which is better for espresso shot and milk based beverage it also ha an active cup warmer which can make a big difference in beverage temperature the dinamica ha better customization more drink and a really good iced coffee function in the end it is up to personal preference but i would personally choose the eletta just based on the grind option liam,fantastic machine my only criticism is the confusing operating instruction which appear to have no logical order for example fitting the water filter is several page in whereas it should be listed a one of the first thing to do in the setup i have also found the menu confusing but maybe that is just me have not yet mastered the automatic on setting but will persevere a the auto off appears to override this setting in summary a great machine but patience is needed to understand the various capability of fine tuning your coffee,hello guy i bought it exactly same coffe machine 8 month ago for couple time i use it but yesterday after month when turn on it try to get cappuccino is going like preparation underway is stop late flat white milk menu still same anyone know what is the problem thanks,can you tell me how this is against the other delonghi machine the delonghi magnifica bean to cup coffee machine black ecam22 360b many thanks,the eletta can reach a much finer grind size and ha an active cup warmer for hotter beverage overall the result will be better on the eletta,f,is is possible to use the frother wand to make hot chocolate put the frother wand into metal jug of coco powder and milk like how baristers make them in costa and starbucks,absolutely this is one of the best feature of the frothing wand you can also use it for other drink like matcha latte liam,hi can you put chai or milo into the bypass doser,just put your milo in the cup first then go to milk menu and fill up with milk do not forget to set your froth dial to preferred level also if you do not want it all milk then simply add some hot water from hot water spout first before attaching the milk carafe,good question the bypass doser can clog when used with other thing such a tea or hot chocolate and so we only recommend using it with pre ground coffee,can you please tell me it is model no,the letter on the end change for each colour so s silver b black w white mine is ecam45760b,model is ecam45760s,man i need one of those,i am sold look amazing,it sold out
