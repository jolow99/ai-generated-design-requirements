Only negative is that because it is built for European 220v outlets, the converter that is required is another small appliance that takes up significant counter space","['usablity', 'durability', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.58332759141922, 0.27348899841308594, 0.07405402511358261, 0.06912939995527267]"

De'Longhi ECAM44.660.B Eletta Bean to Cup Coffee Machine, 1450 W - Black

Benefits of this machine- very easy to use and saves a lot of time with one touch for most popular drinks- ability to customise drinks to suit your taste- automatic frother works very well and has several settings for the different drinks- felt uneasy using pods environmentally and this machine grinds beans fresh- we use the milk from this machine to make hot chocolate for our toddler as we feel safe it will not be too hot for her- we do use this to make tea.  Saves boiling the kettle and you can have hot milk too- love seeing the different layers of the drink through the coffee mugPoints to note- check the dimensions- we have not yet had the joy of performing maintenance on this.  But these machines will require regular filters, decalc and cleaning- grinders are never going to be silentTips- Lavazza coffee beans can be had relatively cheaper from Costco if you are a member- Branded coffee cups can be very expensive.  We have found the IKEA 365+ clear mugs a very suitable alternative.  They do 2 sizes and we have found the smaller ones are a good size for the Cappucino and the larger ones for Lattes and the flat white coffees.- Using a small tub under the ""taps"" when running a clean on the milk caraffe and when powering off the machine, means the drip tray has to be pulled out much less frequently- Placing your coffee cup under the machine when it's turned on means it can get hot with the rinse.- We always run a clean on the caraffe if it's come fresh out of the fridge just to help pre-warm it- I have attached an image we have printed and laminated showing the different drinks that can be made.  This is much easier to show to guests when they are deciding which drink they would like.- The image also includes the different froth settings for the different drinks so will save you having to pull out the manualWe are relatively newbies to the world of coffee coming from a cultural background of tea drinkers. However we had recently been frequenting more and more Costa and then used the Aeropress with a separate frother at home.  We have now moved onto this splendid device and now on average I will have at least 2 coffees a day from this machine (Cappucino in the morning and Flat White later in the day) and then the family have adhoc lattes throughout the day.As always, if you find this review helpful please make sure to let me know.  Knowing you've found it helpful motivates me to do more such reviews.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.31622010469436646, 0.3019670248031616, 0.19214829802513123, 0.1896645873785019]"

   This is the second De'Longhi machine I have owned.  I bought my first which was the DeLonghi 5600 Perfecta over 5 years ago and it still makes a great tasting coffee, however the temperature of the water wasn't as hot as when new so when I saw this new ,machine on offer from amazon I just had to get it.  My first machine has found a new home by the way and is still making great coffee.  When I passed it on it had produced nearly 6000 cups of coffee.This machine is stunning to look at, I just love the black which compliments my kitchen and other appliances.  My old machine was great but this one is a huge step up in terms of performance.  It holds more water, it is quieter, it heats up quickly and holds nearly twice the amount of beans. It also has a replaceable filter so great for hard water areas and the splash tray and coffee grind container are massive compared to the old one which means less emptying.  The milk carafe has also been redesigned going from a round container to a slimmer rectangular shape making it much easier to store in the fridge.  Setting up is so easy, even if you have never used one before as the instructions are clear and easy to follow.  Of course the quality of coffee produced is entirely based on the quality of beans used and it's worth shopping around as there are some wonderful beans about at very low prices.Cleaning is very easy, it comes with all the tools you need and a free bottle of descaler.  If this machine lasts as long as its predecessor then I will be very happy.  An excellent coffee machine and I'm in coffee heaven.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.48330157995224, 0.26303473114967346, 0.14111050963401794, 0.11255323886871338]"
6,"We've had this machine for almost a month. It's fantastic and light years ahead of the Tassimo pod machine it replaced. It looks good too.It produces beautiful freshly ground coffee to our specific taste. As good as any coffee shop you can visit and for around 10p a cup (or 15p a cup if you like your coffee milky). We've based this on buying excellent Taylor of Harrogate beans on a 2 for 1 deal. This cost would obviously rise proportionately if you bought from an artisan producer.Moreover, it produces a perfect cup of coffee quickly, effortlessly and in a simple, foolproof way.Cleaning is mostly automatic, self generated and a doddle.My wife and I like our coffee the same, so we now use the 2 cup function which dispenses 2 espressos simultaneously to exact requirements. Then we manually add the exact amount of frothed milk we prefer using the milk frother or carafe as DeLonghi call it.The coffee output is very warm as opposed to hot, so occasionally we have resorted to a quick heat up in the microwave when we have wanted our coffee to stay hotter for longer for those occasions recently when we decided to sit outside.Don't hesitate. Buy one now.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.5438117384910583, 0.35190626978874207, 0.05354706197977066, 0.05073496699333191]"
7,"Love this coffee machine! It's not perfect, I have a few niggles with it but overall it makes lovely cappuccino and americano, my go to coffees. Get's used at least 3 times a day.It has settings for other milk based coffees but no where does it tell you what the machine does differently. I know what the difference between a cappuccino and a flat white is but i'd like to know what the machine does that's different. as far as I can tell. they are all the same...a shot of coffee...and some milk at varying amounts which you manually set to what ever frothiness you want.Makes a fairly hot cappuccino, think the milk could do with being a degree or to warmer but a long as you drink it immediately its good. I tend to stick mine in the microwave for 15seconds as i like my coffee hot. Temp for a plain coffee is fine.The milk frother works well at it's different settings. After you've made a coffee with it, it will recommend you turn the dial to clean on the forther. At this point I'd recommend you have a spare cup handy to put under it because it sprays milky water all over the place, making quite the mess. This part just doesn't seem thought out at all and is my one main annoyance with this coffee machine. Your try and surrounding worktop will be disgusting after a day of use if you didn't clean up as you go.I still love it even with these gripes. I got it at a reduced price but if I had paid full price I'd be a bit disappointed.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'usablity', 'durability']","[0.33455801010131836, 0.2674962282180786, 0.20603905618190765, 0.19190676510334015]"
8,"Was ok but stopped working yesterday and they want it back to repair it. So I will probably end up with a repaired machine after only 8 months of light use, Refund  would be better or a brand new machine and fresh warranty.Update: Amazon very helpful, DeLonghi not so much, weeks after calling Delonghi help number i finally got an email saying they would arrange to collect and repair, just fill in all your details again and would take upto 21 days, fortunately Amazon help said i could get a refund so that's what i did and had a new different coffee machine the next day, whereas I'd still have weeks to wait for Delonghi to sort it out.After reading lots of reviews i bought a De'Longhi Magnifica ESAM 4200.S which was half price and less fiddling about than the Eletta and way cheaper, I'm very please so far just hope it lasts longer than 8 months.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.4356094002723694, 0.3706039488315582, 0.11412040144205093, 0.07966627925634384]"
9,"...but now she uses it more than me.Had this machine for 8 months and it’s been fantastic. Very easy to use. One of my faveourite things about it is how versatile it is for the different drinks it can make. (Although I think the pre set flat white isn’t right).Little tip, if you want an americano type drink, don’t try to change the ‘short, medium, long’ coffee option, as this is for espresso only. For an Americano just do a normal shot or two and then add hot water.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.5447008609771729, 0.33824124932289124, 0.05909064784646034, 0.057967230677604675]"
