0,"I bought this to replace an older De'Longhi coffee maker that had served well for about 7-8 years. That was also a replacement of an even older De'Longhi machine bought about 18 years ago. The new Stilosa is as near as I could get for a like-for-like replacement. Like many an improved version, this is not as good. It is less easy to use, the original 3 coffee filter cups are replaced by 2, neither of which suit a single cup or a mug, or 2 servings, the steamer control is less straightforward but worst of all, it doesn't make a hot cup of coffee. It is essential to heat the cup first and then halfway through making a coffee it is necessary to stop the process to allow the water heater to come back to temperarture. For the cost of the machine, this is a pretty poor result. If this machine pops its clogs before I do then I won't be replacing it with another De'Longhi. If you want hot coffee then look elsewhere.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.49485883116722107, 0.329024076461792, 0.09925058484077454, 0.07686655223369598]"

2,I only use my machine during winter as i am away working. It stopped working recently. It's very frustrating connecting with amazon to report the problem. Unless you come under a particular heading its difficult to report a problem. This stage my machines guarantee has probably run out.  The machine when working makes great coffee.,"['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.3617800772190094, 0.22460731863975525, 0.21390090882778168, 0.19971172511577606]"
