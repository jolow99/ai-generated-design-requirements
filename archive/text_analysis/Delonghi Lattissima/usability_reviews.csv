0,I wish I can give this vendor zero or minus stars.  I purchased a coffee machine around $600.0 and used it for less than a week and returned it back to the vendor. I received a credit of $320.00 only and they charged $280.00 for restocking fee for a coffee machine that did not work properly. Stay away from this vendor.,"['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.6079630255699158, 0.32741615176200867, 0.036525946110486984, 0.028094854205846786]"
1,"I loved my Pro for the first year; it frothed milk excellently and the Nespresso quality in the espresso itself came out well. Then with no warning the frothing of the milk started to get... frothier. If you perform some searches you'll see this is unfortunately not unique to my experience either; there's clearly a design flaw somewhere and over time, the amount of froth gets out of control, even if you turn the knob all the way to what used to be the ""no froth, just heat the milk"" level. Very frustrating, especially for an expensive machine. What used to be a product I'd cheerfully recommend has turned into something I'll now warn people away from.","['not durability', 'not usability', 'durability', 'usablity']","[0.39033013582229614, 0.23208627104759216, 0.19166156649589539, 0.1859220266342163]"

   Worked great for a week and the milk frother started splattering all over and only make half the amount (2 oz) instead of the normal 4 oz for a latte. Called customer service 4 different times over a month and tried everything they asked including replacing the milk uptake pipe and it still splatters all over and does not make good lattes. Now working with amazon to get a replacement.","['not durability', 'durability', 'usablity', 'not usability']","[0.7102500796318054, 0.11154274642467499, 0.10428328812122345, 0.07392381131649017]"
3,"When I first bought this machine, it worked well, and then the frother, like others started to not get milk into the cup. I, certainly like all of the other negative reviews, was not descaling or cleaning it properly. I also like them properly took advantage of the fact that we as first world Americans, expect everything to work perfectly, even with minimal preparation for a future working product. I originally bought a new frother and then realized it wasn't the frother, but the machine that needed descaled. I descaled the machine 3 times in a row to be sure it was good, and it worked great. I used to store the milk in the frother in the fridge, I no longer do this. I have learned the amount I need and I dump any remaining back into the carton. I then rinse the frother in three parts, the container, the head, and the straw. I then turn the head upside down and dump water into the head unit until the milk color goes away out of the tip of it. I then take RO water and run it through a milk cycle with that to he sure it has no milk in the system. No matter how good their self cleaning system is, it will fail over time because of the starchy characteristics of milk. So why wait for it to let you down, clean it every time (takes 2 min additional max) and enjoy an amazing coffee each and every time. I've had family members that tell me this is better quality than Starbucks.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.3213169574737549, 0.30022069811820984, 0.204934760928154, 0.1735275387763977]"
4,"Very fussy machine.  Delicious drinks but box arrived damaged including broken styrofoam inside.  Unit dripped slower and slower after just 2 weeks and I descaled it although the descale light did not go on.  Improved flow but only lasted a week.  Took forever to brew a latte.  The milk unit requires flushing after each use, into a second container and the whole milk assembly requires going into the dishwasher every 2 days.  Pods are very expensive, hard to find and offer limited flavors.  Really more trouble than it was worth.","['not durability', 'durability', 'usablity', 'not usability']","[0.46332409977912903, 0.2101041078567505, 0.16846637427806854, 0.15810546278953552]"
5,"I have been looking at cappuccino and latte machines for over 6 months from $199 to $3000. I wanted a value but I wanted something easy to use and clean. We narrowed our search down to machines using Nespresso pods. The we looked at specs and reviews and this one stood out and once delivered did not disappoint. The assembly was easy and instructions pretty easy to follow. With a little experimentation we found that for our taste and for the right size we used two pods instead of one to gain coffee strength. We started with the Lungo setting which is larger than the espresso setting. The with another pod we did the cappuccino setting. It was the right amount of whole milk for us and it fit comfortably into a normal sized coffee cup. The milk dispenser cleans after every use and the pods are stored in the interior. The front comes out to drain the basin and remove the used pods and goes back easily. So far we recommend the dark roast pods like Roma, Arpeggio, and Ristretto. You do get a 14 pod sampler with the machine that gives you a wide choice of coffees. We haven't tried the Latte setting which is more milk but we will. Let me add that the machine is not so big that it takes up a lot of counter space and of course you can make regular coffee also. Mornings became a lot more fun.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.4114900529384613, 0.4031926095485687, 0.09278424084186554, 0.0925331711769104]"
6,"I really like  this machine.  In addition to the six pre-programmed coffee drinks, you can also use the milk button to put frothed milk into the cup AFTER you brew the espresso to make a more traditional latte.  It's very versatile. The frother is a nice touch and you can store any unused milk in the fridge.  My only gripe is that it's impossible to find a spare milk frother and they recommend you wash it in your dishwasher every two days. I'm not sure about you, but I don't run the dishwasher every other day, which means I end up cleaning it by hand and even then that requires soaking everything in hot water and soap for 30 minutes.  If I had a spare milk jug, then I could put one in the dishwasher while having a clean one on hand.The machine itself is a nice well built, heavy and made out of stainless steel.  It warms up in less than 30 seconds and makes great espressos and coffee drinks.  I've tried all three types of drinks and even made my own tasty double espresso caramel lattes without any issues.  Be aware of the intensity of the espresso you order since making a Latte with anything less than 6 is going to taste more like flavored milk than coffee unless you add multiple shots which can make your per-cup cost go up.  Some varieties work better as a Cappuccino and of course all the ristretto/espresso/yungo shots I've had all came out well.The interface is easy to use.  Just press a button and coffee (and milk if you're making a Latte/Cappuccino) comes out ready to drink.  Of course you can add a pump or two of syrup if you want, or just add sugar if you like it sweet.  You can adjust the amount of milk/coffee for each drink if you want.  The Milk button is handy if you want to fill larger mug.A problem I did have was my first one was one of the ""Used - Very Good"" Amazon warehouse deal.  Fortunately I was smart and ordered a new one, just in case...and I'm glad I did.  The ""Used"" one (which wasn't used, just packaged up in a different box) didn't come with the pod sampler and because I couldn't get the coffee until Monday, I wouldn't have had anything to use it with for an entire weekend.  So I boxed up the warehouse deal one and sent it back.  So please be aware that you probably wont get any coffee with the machine if you order from their warehouse deals.I'm docking this one star, because one of the things nobody tells you in reviews is that unless you won the lottery and live near one of their very scarce Nespresso boutique locations you will only find genuine Nespresso pods online.  I thought I would be able to go down to Bed, Bath and Beyond and find them there.  The only Nespresso-compatible pods you might manage to find locally are the Cafepresso pods at Walmart or the Starbucks pods at Kroger (which were sold out at the one near me).  Even the places where they sell the machine locally like Williams Sonoma and Sur La Table don't sell the pods which is ridiculous.  In the sampler, they give you one of each of their varieties, and it was disappointing to find a flavor I loved and not be able to get more until the next week.  So I suggest you order some pods you might think you'll like along with the machine and understand you'll be most likely ordering all the coffee for it online.  I have no problem with that, but I wish I would have known ahead of time since I ended up getting the machine on a Friday.So if you do order this, make sure you order early enough that you can get the machine and the coffee at the same time.  Start with the Ristretto or the Arpeggio which taste more like traditional espresso and are strong enough to make into a Cappuccino or a Latte until you can order a welcome pack from Nespresso which comes with free gifts.TLDR:Good, versatile machine.  Provides easy access to coffee drinks and espressos.  Frother works well.  Just make sure you buy coffee online along with the machine, because more than likely nobody will sell it anywhere near where you live.Edit: After about a year, I now wish we would have gotten a Creatista instead.  The issue is that this requires you to store unused milk in the fridge and since I'm mostly a weekend coffee drinker, I've had too much unused milk go bad.  The milk frother that this comes with has several parts and is a bit of a pain to wash.  With the Creatista I could have just washed the jug out and stored it instead.  I'll eventually be replacing this machine with a Creatista.  It's probably more just a personal preference thing.","['durability', 'usablity', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.26807281374931335, 0.25284454226493835, 0.24061791598796844, 0.23846475780010223]"
7,"This is our newest addition to our Nespresso machines. Yes, we’ve been using them for many years.DeLonghi machines last forever. We now have a couple of extra machines that we tuck away in our home office, real office, in our travel bag, and in the trailer or boat.This machine has the milk frother. It has an easy clean cycle. Hubby loves his hot latte.Guests use it cause it’s so easy.We buy our pods here on Amazon and they were about 70 cents for each espresso. Much better than other coffee houses. They also have a lot of good coffee variety, but you’ll need to go to Nespresso store for that.I used to have a super automatic espresso machine, but honestly, the coffee is fresher when it stays in foil until being used.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.5237373113632202, 0.3702074885368347, 0.05774252861738205, 0.048312682658433914]"
8,"Purchased this after getting a lower priced Nespresso model in which the foaming attachment kept malfunctioning.  We even returned this one after yet another malfunction and then purchased the next one directly from Nespresso.That machine operated fine for us.  But we stopped using the milk foamer and instead just used our own milk/creamers.  It was just less fussy for us.We used this machine for well over a year.  The coffee is excellent but the price of having to constantly purchase capsules became ridiculously exorbitant.  Looking over all my orders, for over a year of use for 2 people and the occasional guest, we spent over $1600 on coffee capsules.  After using it for 15 months we decided to invest in a Jura that uses regular bagged coffee instead of spending so much on capsules.","['usablity', 'durability', 'not durability', 'not usability']","[0.3191148042678833, 0.31582701206207275, 0.256561815738678, 0.10849642008543015]"
9,I've been drinking home brewed espresso from my own hi pressure expresso machines for 15 plus years now.  My wife had been drinking Keurig coffee because making an express was too much work for her liking.  When I saw the DeVito/Clooney Nespresso commercial for Nespresso I scoffed.  I never believe such a machine could math the taste of a real pulled Espresso.  In my desire to bring my wife back into the espresso fold. I decided to try this Lattissama Pro machine and I was skeptical.  I bought it and the Nespresso variety pack of pods.  All I can say is wow.  I haven't had a bad cup yet and my wife loves it too.  One machine cleared up counter space when the Keurig and my Espresso machines went to the garage.  Non Nespresso pods from other makers have been great too.  Love this machine.,"['durability', 'usablity', 'not usability', 'not durability']","[0.5251826643943787, 0.3338981866836548, 0.07514248043298721, 0.06577656418085098]"
