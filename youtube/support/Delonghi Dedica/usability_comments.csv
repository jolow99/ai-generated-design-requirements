414,i bought a new ec685 in january 2019 i had one older that i bought 3 year ago but the pump gave up 3 year wa ok a i usually make 7 double shot a day i think the best advantage with my new one not shown in this video are the coffee filter now made up of 2 part the perforated filter that can be removed from the part with the one small hole for pressurizing this make it easier to check clogging in the perforated filter and the other part just hold up the part to a light window and you will observe any clogging use a needle a described in the manual to avoid clogging i also place a small round piece of filter paper that i cut out from normal melitta filter to perfectly fit the bottom of the perforated part one melitta filter give me 14 small piece and i cut 4 filter at the same time which is pretty fast and i now have 56 piece to further avoid clogging i weekly clean the filter by putting a 1 3 tsp of baking soda in the filter basket and run 2 3 water shot and then rinse the part a mentioned this is pressurized system but it would be very easy to make it a non pressurized system just drilling the one small hole to open it further i will try on the 1 shot filter to see how it work,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.4848725497722626, 0.30210790038108826, 0.21301959455013275]"

423,for what a stranger on the internet opinion worth you would struggle to pull it off due to the temperature fluctuation between steam wand and espresso with this machine due it single boiler you will have inconsistent shot if selling latte and cappuccino and if you plan on making any quantity of espresso the water will be quick to overheat and it wont be so great the pressurised portafilter while convenient will not give you the kind of shot that a dedicated grinder fresh bean and correct grind size and extraction will you will be far more suited to aim for something in the prosumer market instead with a dual boiler coupled with a good quality grinder use the rancillio rocky a a point of reference if you any question i am happy to help just pop me an email at elevatecoffeetraining gmail com the world always need more coffee cheer,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5453597903251648, 0.3977721035480499, 0.05686815083026886]"

448,is it just me because i bought a machine on the european market or is delonghi a little off the standard the single cup button give me 50ml 1 7 oz and the double cup button give me 100ml 3 4 oz should not it be 30ml and 60ml 1 and 2 oz i know i can reprogram the button but how it is done seems pretty inaccurate to me,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6042128801345825, 0.31164297461509705, 0.08414406329393387]"

631,in order to get more foam you should try aerating the milk first for about 4 ish second so basically you keep the stream almost at the top of the milk and you hear this sound almost like paper ripping and after you put the nozzle all the way in to finish foaming the milk for a cappuccino you can aerate the milk for about 7 10 second which will produce much more foam a cappuccino is mainly foam and a little bit of milk but thanks for the review of the machine,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6660134196281433, 0.26645776629447937, 0.06752882897853851]"

776,anthony according to the manual you should position an empty container under the cappuccino maker and open the dial for a few second to eliminate any air left in the circuit close the dial again so you should not draw any water just make sure there is no air caught up in the tube this is very different from the instruction for cooling the machine to make coffee again to make coffee again immediately after frothing milk the boiler must first be cooled or the coffee will be burnt proceed a follows place a container under the cappuccino maker open the steam dial to deliver hot water and cool the boiler you only need to draw hot water when you want the temp to go down to coffee making level if you draw water before wanting to use steam you are basically cooling down the machine before you start it make no sense,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.839567244052887, 0.13462112843990326, 0.02581159584224224]"
777,jcosk8 i think he is doing it correctly he first draw it down to release some of the residual water that is how it is explained in the instruction manual a well i understand that if you continue to draw water it will cool down the boiler so that you can make espresso again i think he is right in that it is not the strongest heating element so you have to let it warm up for a few minute i also have my toaster plugged in to the same outlet i do not know if that make a difference,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7663458585739136, 0.17521663010120392, 0.0584375336766243]"
778,do you do it like him if so it is wrong the down position is to draw water and bring the temp down so you can brew coffee after steaming milk if you draw water and bring the heat down then it stop midway in the steaming if you do it correctly it should not stop you will actually have to cool it down to continue using it for coffee,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7474387884140015, 0.18982559442520142, 0.06273563206195831]"

1353,long time dedica user here here are a couple of tip not mentioned or fully explained in the video 1 absolutely do get the proper non pressurised basket you can get it on amazon or elsewhere either with the whole portafilter or just the basket warning the default delonghi portafilter ha a plastic part inside that prevents inserting a deeper proper non pressurised basket but with a little patience and a hacksaw you can simply cut a centimetre or so from the plastic part to make everything fit so you will be able to continue using the default portafilter p ka the pressurised basket allows you to brew essentially anything but you have very little control over brew time in this video they were quite lucky to get something espresso like in most case you will struggle to square a circle it will either choke or brew too quick or you will get inconsistent random result so definitely get the non pressurised basket 2 the button are programmable just push and keep pressing it for the desired length of time it will then remember how long you pressed it very useful when dialling in new coffee just settle on the right dose and grind size get the time right 25 30 s and next time you will get the same result consistently 3 use darker roast look guy i know we are all fan of the light roasted hipster coffee here but this machine can not extract them properly sorry for the allcaps but this point need stressing i learnt it the hard way so perhaps you will not have to if a specialty coffee roastery in czechia and abroad tell you oh do not worry our espresso roast is perfect for home machine they are lying to you it is still way too light roasted to be extracted well by dedica you see the machine doe not really produce high enough temperature even if you set see the manual the water temp to max i remember reading it only get to about 86 c which is simply too low for proper extraction of what modern roaster call espresso or medium roast what you will get will be intensely sour and unpleasant at least to my palate without sugar on the other hand if you use something more traditional doe not have to be very dark just darker than what most specialty coffee roaster usually offer you will get a quite pleasant traditional espresso thick creamy not too bitter not sour sometimes quite sweet i found that brazilian coffee usually work the best with this machine in short look for more developed roast with low acidity 4 steaming milk the wand ha 2 setting use them you can really produce quite acceptable microfoam if you start with the cappuccino setting get some air in and then switch to hot milk to get that vortex swirling going that produce very fine foam it take a bit of practice but it is not hard watch some video on general tip for milk steaming after you finish clean the wand and then you will have to open the valve again to let off the excess heat steam so that the machine return to the normal coffee brewing setting 5 comandante grinder setting naturally this will depend heavily on the coffee bean and dose you are using i only use non pressurised deeper basket and my dose is usually between 17 19 gram the corresponding comandante c40 setting are usually between 7 10 click finer for darker roast coarser for lighter roast be careful not to choke it machine totally you might rupture the o ring in the grouphead it can be easily replaced but be extra careful not to tear the thread on the screw the bed is made of plastic and it can easily happen a you try to tighten it then it will not hold the shower screen properly and the o ring will keep popping out replacing the plastic part is quite a pain in the as for the non mechanic like me so be aware,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.47805631160736084, 0.3124394714832306, 0.20950427651405334]"

1420,hi really good video thanks i have the same machine but i had little to no success brewing with the advanced mode first i modified my delonghi coffee grinder to be able to grind finer coffee that worked out great then i tried loading that finer coffee into the pressurized basket but the machine fails to brew it it just pump and barely any coffee come out whatever come out is super bitter at the end i did not tamper the coffee at all just scoop it in and brew and it just simply fails to brew fine coffee i have a feeling the machine ha some trickery with the opv valve and it is just pumping and never releasing pressure completely pressing the coffee together and not letting any water through i have purchased unpressurized basket obviously i had to cut out plastic piece from the portafilter to fit it it is a basket with many hole on the middle but not in the entire basket like yours this wa the only one i found locally but it is not pressurized and that is the point i had better success brewing espresso grind coffee with it but even after many many attempt the quality never come close to the one brew with the pressurized basket on default coarser coffee the output wa always bitter you have no control over the water quantity only the brew length also i think the opv might have some special tuning not really suited for this i wa to be honest surprised it worked for you and now i am suspecting it is something with my machine i wa also suspecting my skill are bad and they might be still but then if you copy everything at least some crappy coffee should come out not undrinkable bitterness so i just go with the crappy machine theory not in general but mine i am a bit tired of upgrading it i also did the wand upgrade and i think i will step forward to a breville dual boiler,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.6360648274421692, 0.19775839149951935, 0.16617685556411743]"

1423,i also had this delonghi coffee appliance it is not a machine at this price point and also the grinder i did not mod it but used it at 3 5 based on the coffee if the grind is too fine the appliance basically choke because it try to push water through a plug with a very small point and it can not do that a such you are overbrewing and from there you get the bitterness oh and also the delonghi grinder is not the most consistent one for espresso it might be for french press or pour over but not for espresso now you have 3 option either continue with the pressurized basket and decrease the amount of coffee and increase the grind setting until you find a setting you like setting on a coffee or go non pressurized but with a different portafilter see aliexpress for 51mm bottomless portafilters and again find a setting you like or the third more expensive option upgrade the grinder to a better one imo first come the coffee bean then the grinder and finally the espresso appliance machine i have the baratza encore but i would have gone honestly with either a manual good grinder or save up a bit for a better espresso grinder like the lelit pl 043 fred,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.5877047181129456, 0.3358037769794464, 0.07649150490760803]"

1535,guy thanks for making this video and the rest of the valuable content i would like to share my experience and challenge with dedica ec 685 after several month of use my setup is dedica eureka silenzio grinder i have a single bottom filter basket for two cup and original double bottom my biggest challenge wa consistent extraction at what seems to be that sweet spot for a particular coffee type i did pretty well in avoiding channeling playing with the right amount of coffee and extraction time keeping everything clean and yes sometimes result were surprisingly good but sometimes the acidity bitterness wa present that i could not explain i understand that there are people who might not have this issue and are perfectly happy with their cup of espresso from the single bottom filter basket on dedica i am just not one of them now come the part why i am writing this after month of using a single bottom re watching this video i decided to give it a try with 13 gram in the double bottom basket that came with the machine i wa surprised how good coffee wa and how easy it is to consistently reproduce the same taste compared to a single bottom filter and le messy even without channeling i wa too focused on getting that right shoot with single bottom and completely overlook double bottom i am using a relatively fine grind setting but avoid much force when tampering just enough to make coffee sit nice and clean inside the basket hope this will be of some help to anyone struggling with the single bottom filter on this machine,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.6170493960380554, 0.3317694365978241, 0.05118120089173317]"

1899,black89velvet probieren kostet nichts da hast du recht allerdings besteht ja da problem darin das man zwei lav mics hat die beide die stimme aufzeichnen der schall braucht ja auch seine zeit um zur jeweiligen membran zu gelangen wenn die beiden mikros nun halt einen halben meter oder meter voneinander entfernt sind hat man einen unsch nen delay die phase anzugleichen kann dann manuell fummelig sein und phase umzukehren passt bei beweglichen mikros vermutlich auch eher selten au erdem hat da n here mikrofon ja ein deutlich bassigeres signal durch den nahbesprechungseffekt wodurch eine phaseninvertierung sowieso da signal nicht entfernen w rde deshalb mein tipp einfach ein noisegate bzw manuell da weiter entfernte lav mic deaktivieren oder in adobe audition gibt e auch hervorragende tool um hall und raumklang bzw unangenehme delay zu entfernen,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5409173965454102, 0.23772090673446655, 0.2213616520166397]"

1977,do you grind your own coffee maybe you grinding is too fine so the water doe not pas through a you have seen on the first shot he tried to take and the measure depends on the type of coffee usually dark roast require smaller dos and lighter roast higher dos if you are using the pressurised basket included in the machine that might be a whole other problem,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.7066507935523987, 0.22623160481452942, 0.06711757183074951]"

1979,valter nogueira fair enough also the only setting you can manage in the machine is amount of time for single or double shot not water flow so it pump for x second and depending on the grain size you get x amount of extraction with the standard port til filter i think you get a single shot 30gr in le than 10 second,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7711163759231567, 0.16512584686279297, 0.0637577474117279]"

2083,saeed miramini i am really happy to hear that you got better coffee by increasing the tamping pressure after you got the new tamper i suggest you to adjust the grind size according to the taste of the coffee since not many people use the finest grind size of the breville smart grinder pro you may try to use coarser setting if your espresso is too bitter i hope you will get a better coffee experience with your new tamper and have a nice christmas,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7172593474388123, 0.20774205029010773, 0.07499850541353226]"
2084,chan chun ho dear chan i really appreciate your comprehensive response and sharing your experience with me that wa really useful totally agree with you that due to larger pressure of dedica and the smaller thickness of coffee pack in the portafilter the optimum extraction time is shorter following your suggestion i increased the tamping pressure and managed to get a 15 s extraction finest grind setting 14gr coffee brewing ratio 1 2 the extraction and the taste of coffee wa better i have ordered a calibrated tamper to control my tamping pressure for even better and more consistent extraction thanks again cheer,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8661501407623291, 0.0998782068490982, 0.03397165983915329]"
2085,saeed miramini hi saeed i have been using the ec685 and the breville smart grinder pro for half a year now i am happy to help and i hope you can find some of the point below useful 1 the normal situation is 25 30 second for 9 bar of pressure however the ec685 give you 15 bar of pressure it is expected that your shot will appear like 15 20 second 2 the normal portafilter ha a 58mm radius with 18 gram of coffee however the ec685 with the bottomless portafilter ha a 51mm radius with 15 16 gram of coffee so your shot will be even faster since the coffee puck will have le resistance 3 i have tried using the finest grind setting and it chocked the ec685 and no coffee came out a a result so if you have a short extraction even with the finest grind setting you have to tamp harder you need about 10kg of force to make the coffee puck harder before putting it into your ec685 here is the technique that i am currently using 10 15 kg tamping 15 0 gram in bottomless portafilter breville smart grinder pro setting at 9 scale from 50 to 1 extraction time at about 15 second please let me know if you made any improvement good luck,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6751154065132141, 0.26456835865974426, 0.060316264629364014]"

2175,mike sharp my niche solution above probably doe not help you much on a tight budget in your position i would go with a hand grinder but make sure it get reviewed particularly for espresso since you mention james hoffman he did review some hand grinder and it is a great watch but iirc his focus wa more on filter coffee coarseness so have a good look around i hope you find something that suit your need,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5339427590370178, 0.3066813051700592, 0.15937601029872894]"

2219,you should definetly programm the maschine i programmed my machine so that on a double shot it extrakts around 69g of pure water without the portafilter attached this setting will get me with a 16g dose to the desired parameter of a 2 0 2 2 extraction ratio depending on the grind setting and a extraction time between 20 and 30 sec be aware that programming the right amount of water can be tricky and take couple of shot but because i programm without any portafilter no coffee is wasted just hold the middle button until the scale show the right amount pro tipp release the button approximately 5 sec before 69gramms good luck one more thing the dedica is inherently inconsistent so if you think you are doing exactly the same thing a the previous shot but the extraction time varies when your puc prep is the same the maschine wa the one who wa not consistent,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.4844851791858673, 0.345914751291275, 0.16960006952285767]"

2366,using a bambino plus for half a year already with the smart grinder on the side my advice get a good grinder something that can grind finer than supermarket espresso grind it is the marriage between the grinder and the machine that make up a good coffee if you buy the smart grinder be careful with light roast a they strain the grinder is internals you can fill the hopper full with dark roast but for light roast only grind what you will brew it really kinda closed the deal with u when we realized that two thing became possible at the same time i can play around with espresso and bean and grind she can prepare milk and coffee drink by just pressing a button if you happen to be in the same situation go for the bambino plus,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8592103123664856, 0.09597832709550858, 0.0448114275932312]"

2466,i am coming to this late and echoing other comment but i have had a silvia for decade i bought it just after college and after using that gaggia model you james used to sell at a friend is family is house and being disappointed both by the result and the friend is father pointing out that that quick discharge system into the drip tray wa a weak point he would replaced a couple of machine within warranty on which that valve failed and made a mess one presumes they have made that more robust by now but to be clear i am into modding my silvia ha a pid controller that i installed it is also easy to find vendor who pre install them last time i checked and i keep toying with the idea of better insulating the boiler and adding a pressure gauge which may be easier now than the last time i checked i got stopped by the need to drill through the metal exterior which i am fine with in principle i just do not own any drill bit that would do the job maybe i am especially rough or careless definitely careless once when i accidentally left it switched on with the steam wand open during a party and blew the boiler by letting it run empty but i have had to do some internal repair and part replacement that boiler swap wa the big one and i am not counting the necessarily frangible component the brew and steam wand gasket but i have had a couple of leaking seal along the copper pipe and in fact have just been using a french press lately a it is got one right now i am not sure that sort of maintenance requirement is a bad thing it seems about in keeping with what i know of professional machine especially professional machine also from rancilio from friend in the business i have never been a professional barista and they were modulo working with pressure vessel is inherently terrifying pretty easy repair that i did not think were excessively expensive,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5209400653839111, 0.3087041676044464, 0.17035584151744843]"
2467,oh also since you brought up heat up time in the more recent under gbp1500 video my older rev than the one you reviewed here maybe they have gotten better maybe especially the pro is better silvia take about 30 minute to heat up so i have it connected through a wemo smart plug i switch that on from my phone when i wake up and by the time i have showered and come downstairs it is up to temp i mean except the brewhead portafilter and basket of course but that lengthy heat up time is why i will probably eventually get around to insulating the boiler better i am not always on the other side of a shower from wanting coffee some time that is just after dinner work great for me i do computer b for a living maybe a drag for others,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.675485372543335, 0.2647732198238373, 0.05974138528108597]"

2494,i had the silvia for about 10 year before substantially upgrading a year ago i am grateful to the silvia because it taught me a lot about pulling shot but that learning came about because it is a very tricky machine to use you really have to temperature surf on it and even then it can let you down occasionally i found it really tough to work with and even after year of using it and knowing it well i would occasionally get a very disappointing shot last year i upgraded to an ecm synchronika oh my spending that much money seemed like lunacy at the time i also went nut and got the expensive ceado grinder the j i think but it is made making coffee every morning not only a joy but a privilege i did not think i would say this but it is probably one of the best item of anything from car to fountain pen i have ever bought all to say that i am glad i started with the silvia and i am grateful to it for teaching me so much about what go into preparing and pulling a great shot but i am also really thankful that i never have to use it again would i recommend it a a first serious machine absolutely but that would also come with a warning you have to be dedicated and interested to learn how to prepare good espresso it will not do it for you like me you will also be extremely happy when you upgrade,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6521187424659729, 0.2391052097082138, 0.1087760329246521]"

2543,so i have had the gaggia for about six month it is a great basic machine that i can pull espresso from all day i have replaced the basket and the opv spring 10 minute and i have now bought dollar50 worth of component off aliexpress to install a pid to deal with the temperature fluctuation there is a whole series of video about temp surfing that i really can not be bothered with and it is all because of the very simple and basic thermostat in the machine the rancillio is the same but because the boiler is substantially larger the temp swing are slower i am hoping the pid will stabilize the temp on the gaggia a bit better do not get me wrong i just pulled a latte for my son which he love but i have had a few time where the steam heat just did not seem to be there if it still continues to bug me i may have to spring for the beastly steam of the rancilio another great thing about the gaggia and the rancilio is that they are endlessly repairable every part is replaceable and available and if you are at all handy you can do it yourself like i said i have watched a few video on installing a pid and i have now got the part for dollar50 the gaggia wa a dollar350 refurb from wholelattelove and it ha worked great so dollar400 buy a pid controlled espresso machine what is not to love btw here is a good example of the pid hack and the part list is in the description,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.45531296730041504, 0.4234774708747864, 0.12120955437421799]"

2654,nice review btw you put the drip tray grid the wrong way round on the lelit if you put it the other way it look way better cause there s no gap anymore and also it s not wobbling around etc i ve got the lelit anna but with pid pl41 tem for a while now i can really recommend it and i really think it s especially good for beginner cause you always have some kind of visual feedback and also control in the end it s the same process a with a machine without pid trial and error but it s le of a guessing game cause you can see the temperatur in the kettle and can easily work your way up to a good shot by adjusting the different parameter grind temperatur time etc i got mine new for 390euros i think you get good value for your money also one important thing is the spare part availability it s really easy to get lelit spare part so you could potentially have the machine for a whole life i guess if a part your delonghi is broken well you can throw it away a much a i love it here are some con for those of you that consider buying the lelit like james already mentioned the steam isn t a powerful and also pretty watery but with a small single circle mashine you ll never get that good steam but it seems lile the rancilio doe better here the water tank it ha a strange odor to it after a while and the opening is pretty unhandy do get water in without spilling and also almost impossible to clean properly the new one have a better tank with a big opening i think almost every anna owner changed the tank into a glas vase or another plastic tank i did cut a bigger hole in it you can only see the water level in the tank from one side unhandy if you need to place it next to a wall the portafilter doesn t slide in too well so you got ta hold it while putting it in o think that d different from machine to machine and i guess it s because the tolerance while building aren t that high on this part the first two machine i ordered were scratched really badly in this area the drip tray itself is a bit wobbly cause of the design the drip tray grid doesn t habe enough hole in it too much metal cover if you wan na steam in the drip tray after steaming mill it really make a mess cause of the watery steam hitting the metal grid u get used to it and either steam in a glass or a towl or place it directly above a hole the top part aka cup warmer doesn t really get that hot the tamper it come with is just a cheap plastic thing u can t use the single espresso portafilter don t know the proper name somehow me and a lot of other people can t get good shot with it but that s also a common problem not only with lelit sorry if my grammar etc is wrong i m from germany,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.5114429593086243, 0.28763869404792786, 0.2009183019399643]"

2693,i have had my rancilio silvia for eight year and it still delivers espresso every day at a reasonable high quality i am partly convinced the reason i have not upgraded my espresso setup yet is because it is the silvia granted a dual boiler would be nice due to the elimination of the waiting time between shot and steaming milk if one is new at espresso brewing and milk based espresso drink i really think the silvia is a good choice it punishes the user for not doing thing properly and it can be a frustrating a motivating for learning the basic my machine wa around gbp400 at purchase 3 999 danish kr,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.737468421459198, 0.13321854174137115, 0.12931303679943085]"

3175,a a car and coffee lover i get what you are thinking with the analogy but let me assure you he is not trying to tell you that you need 400hp it is more that we know how good coffee can be and all these option have varying degree of compromise that can prevent you in one way or another from achieving a really good cup in keeping with a car analogy let say the top end desirable cup is a dailey focused car that is not a luxury car but is a more expensive car because it ha a better build quality and le fault than it more affordable competitor they will all get you to a to b but one of those choice ha le fault better maintenance experience and maybe even is a car more friendlier than the rest for doing home repair it is not that we are insulting low budget i am on a lower budget trying to educate myself and trying to discern right now how much do i want need to invest a we speak i have been holding off for year now on getting my first espresso machine for much of the reason and flaw revealed in this video it is that we know each of the option ha something that might really be holding it back from making peak good coffee or something at least very close and if you know how good it could be it is really an insult and painful to all of u a coffee lover to have to recommend a machine that still cost something but will prevent the buyer from making peak quality coffee the take away i am trying to say is he is not telling you to buy a bmw m2 c instead of a civic because it is an objectively better car even though what you need is a reliably affordably daily and you do not need a track car instead think of it that he is trying to warn you away from buying car in the category of the pontiac g5 they are cheap and like any car get you to a to b but they are infamous for multitude of issue making it one of the worst budget daileys you could pick we are trying to say maybe spend more money on a new accord or civic because yes it is more money whose function is to only daily but the point is that you are trying to pick something le terrible it all come down to how happy you are with the end result coffee from each budget range if you are happy with the coffee you can get from lower budget machine than that is fantastic and no one should be insulting that like i am stuck right now because i would rather not spend a much a a 3090 gpu on a machine and grinder individually but i also really do not want to get a cheaper machine that is finicky and difficult and will hold me back from making a perfect cup once i get the experience i actually do not know how much i need to spend to get that but i took away some really solid info from this video about the downfall of each machine,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.43753546476364136, 0.3673153519630432, 0.19514915347099304]"

3237,one of the worst thing to hear is professional background you mean starbucks with portafilter and dark roast duh if that is professional then leave that behind also i am not sure who are the dumbs always insisting on 25 30 second crap ever since i heard that you can not overextract coffee i just gave up on time and thus reduced lot of frustration in getting nice shot esp that of lighter roast time i have gone up a high a 1 minute 21 second and i always aim for far le than 1 2 and i start my time from the first drop mind that the grind i set is way finer so it may take up to 50 second to see first drop per me ristroto is the best one to go for i have gone a low a 1 0 5 and there is no name for it yet but for super super light roast check your grinder first or else it can spoil it the lowest yield result is best taste and i have cheaper version of delonghi the model you are showing is crap with all automatic timer etc cheaper one is much better just punch a hole in portafilter and you end up with naked one smaller size help because you can have more cup at a time and the infatuation about foam duh btw for delonghi the best flow rate is drip drip drip if it is moving faster then you will not get a good shot and drip drip drip mean no foam sorry instagramers,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.3904704749584198, 0.3466346859931946, 0.26289480924606323]"

3307,i had free gift card money and went with the bambino i ditched the portafilter and bought a dollar60 wood handled one with a bottomless 54mm basket on amazon i did not have an espresso grinder with finite adjustment and i bought a eureka mignon silencio i am able to pull shot through a naked portafilter without any channeling on the bambino but that is because i have a dollar500 grinder now i like flat white and the auto milk frothing is good enough for me middle setting on heat lowest on froth you are not going to do any latte art with the milk jug that come with the machine unless drawing antartica is considered art what is frustrating is how sensitive the bambino is to grind size you can see on james is grind chart the bambino is by far the coarsest setting compared to the others anything too fine and it will jam the group head an 8th of a turn on the silencio is the entire grind setting range for the bambino there is practically zero adjustment i am just shy of choking the machine to get a double shot 18 8g in 38g out in 28sec and it still taste thin to me any shot programming change with different bean or blending two bean in varying ratio the grinder is still breaking in and i have found the shot programming to be useless to me so far i am ready to ditch the bambino after 2 month it also demand a cleaning cycle every 50 shot manual state 200 but i have had the blinky light twice in two month clean me or i blink cleaning cycle every time i turn on i am only doing 2 shot a day i could see it having a place in a motor home,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.5549243092536926, 0.3359074592590332, 0.10916822403669357]"

3360,i own a gaggia classic and have used my friend racilio silvia they were both great machine to start learning how to pull espresso shot they were definitely fussy when it came to controlling the temperature and required guestimating the best timing to pull the shot by i e listening to the boiler instead of relying on the indicator light but they were both really capable of pulling great shot at time and were enjoyable to use i did find that cleaning the gaggia classic wa a bit of a fuss since the group head often required to be taken apart to do some good cleaning to get rid of all the old coffee grind i think the two are great entry machine for espresso for anyone looking to start the path of espresso a a hobby it definitely take time to learn the skill finding your favorite bean a well a for all the maintenance but if you are looking to get the reward of getting great coffee at home by paying that extra time those two are a great way to go also i had the same exact experience with the steam on those two machine i wa not very happy with the steam on the gaggia classic but wa impressed by the silvia and this wa back in the early 2000s so i guess those two machine have not changed very much since then,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7536025643348694, 0.14893625676631927, 0.09746122360229492]"

3430,before it even start i am quietly rooting for the rancilio silvia i had one of those for year before i upgraded to what i have now which is a wega mininova the main reason i ditched the rancilio is becuase i wanted dual boiler and a hot water outlet plumbed through a water filtration softening unit not long after i actually purchased the wega rancilio released the silvia pro which come with all of those thing i am just not sure if it is a plumbed unit though i am sure it ha the option though i had my original silvia retro fitted to run a a plumbed unit all that being said the rancilio silvia is an absolutely fantastic unit and it make such good coffee if you were just making coffee for one or two people it is more than adequate incidentally the grinder i purchased with the silvia wa also made by rancilio the rancilio rocky non doser version and is still the grinder i use today i could not recommend that grinder more highly anyway back to the video i suppose finger crossed for the silvia edit it wa cool to see the silvia do so well i must say one of the first thing i did do wa install a pid on my machine due to the variant in water temperature i found that particular mod wa money well spent and the quality of coffee wa much more consistent great video a per usual and very informative review,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.7294214367866516, 0.22123830020427704, 0.049340251833200455]"

3433,hi i wa deciding in between the gaggia new classic the lelit anna and potentially the rancilio a the last option due to the higher price however i have learned today that the gaggia ha an alloy boiler with some coating and that is a massive turnoff for me the advantage of it is that the boiler get hot very quickly due to the alloy body and small size however i am a bit concerned about the material due to potential health risk and would like to avoid having any alloy part in my machine in spite of the coating whilst the coating is on it should be fine but potential galvanic corrosion after year of usage and descaling doe not sound like a good deal to me what do you think should this be a real concern or is it unnecessary nitpicking cheer,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.4527556300163269, 0.44841253757476807, 0.09883184731006622]"

3448,john gamble pressurized portafilters allow to use coarsely and or unevenly ground coffee and still oull a decent shot of espresso they create the resistance that the coffee can not because it is coarse or uneven if you have an espresso capable grinder get an unpressurized basket and a tamper and you will note the difference in the shot i should say that unless your grinder is espresso capable you should not bother with this you can not use an unpressurized basket with preground coffee you need to grind fresh and with the correct size for this,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7541087865829468, 0.14437878131866455, 0.10151240974664688]"

3451,just a a hint for everyone thinking about buying of of the machine the difference between the gaggia classic pro and the rancilio silvia here in the u is 449dollar compared to 735dollar so a total of 286dollar you have to spend more for getting 30 second when steaming milk it is a no brainer to buy the gaggia at this point i have owned and used both and i would highly recommend saving the money bc the gaggia is capable of creating great coffee drink it is the technique and knowledge you need not the fancy machine,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8379198312759399, 0.10093236714601517, 0.061147820204496384]"

3481,guillaume feugueur let me tell you there is a bias i have owned both of the machine and still own the gaggia classic old model with the good part before they sold to philip and put cheap stuff inside the espresso coming out of both machine a well a the capability to steam milk and create latte art is phenomenal given the size and the price though i am a hobby barista i do not use scale or any fancy stuff to pull my shot the comparison he made is on a too high level i have upgraded to a rocket appartamento thats when thing start to get noticeable better in my opinion since i needed to sell it though i am back at the gaggia classic and believe me it very close to any good coffee shop out there and by far the best option for in home flat white you can get go for the machine you prefer optically or take milk into consideration cause with both you will have to adjust temp surf a little and live with their own special need if your daily drinking habit contain more than 1 2 latte or flat white go for the silvia cause you will save 30 second every time you steam if it is just espresso go for the gaggia i found it easier to control the temp,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7377377152442932, 0.18329396843910217, 0.07896828651428223]"

3501,i could not agree more the dedica ha instruction for lowering and rising the temperature in the instructive it also suggests warming up your cup by running hot water on it from the basket which is obviously to also heat up the basket thus aiding with the extraction process speaking of which i actually think that the plastic piece on the basket is key to prevent hot water and hot espresso from touching cold metal since the plastic actually insulates it i feel like when you dismantle the basket and take out the plastic piece then it will lower your espresso temperature playing with the temp setting and also with the grind with different coffee blend ha made my experience with the dedica quite enjoyable for over two year already my rule of thumb is using the low temp setting for dark roast medium for both dark and medium roast and high temp for either lighter roast or for certain more dense and or more acidic coffee another great thing about the dedica is that you can instantly stop the flow by pushing the button again if you push the button and leave it pressed the flow will continue until you release and the machine will remember that setting i e very basic but you can program it,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7898679971694946, 0.1548110991716385, 0.05532091483473778]"

3597,i own both the rancilio silvia and the gaggia classic pro the silvia is a tank our un modified version ha been working for almost 15 year without a single problem it is quite sensitive to temperature meaning your shot can be ruined if you do not pull them the second the boiler get up to proper temperature when light turn off but if you are careful and turn off the pump a soon a the light turn on again we get great extraction the gaggia just arrived and i have been frustrated with the low clearance under the portafilter none of my regular sized mug will fit and you can only pull a shot for 5 6 second before the light turn off telling you that the temp ha dropped but a video i saw solved that problem if you click the steam button and leave on for 19 20 second before you pull the shot you get hot water during the entire extraction and the shot are pretty stellar we do not use either machine for steaming milk so i can not comment on that,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.7806573510169983, 0.19527263939380646, 0.02407003380358219]"

3611,great review james enjoyable a always why are you not recommending the rancilio pro it had the pid built in ofc that will increase the price point which wa already above the limit you set but it also confirms to me that there is not much benefit upgrading my gaggia to silvia unless i buy the pro,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.505144476890564, 0.32723695039749146, 0.16761860251426697]"
3612,the silvia pro is at least twice the price from the regular silvia probably more even depending on where you live it look really good but you can get a regular silvia with a pid for much greater value depending on what you need from it but i think the point here is that you could get either the gaggia or silvia and later on modify it with a pid that is not really something that would be worth it on the others he is reviewing here i guess you are correct though upgrading from gaggia to a regular silvia is mostly a side step since they are in a similar price range,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.46933889389038086, 0.2878395617008209, 0.2428215593099594]"

3691,may be a very stupid question however i am new to brewing at home can you take a pressurised portafilter out and put in a normal basket such a what james ha done here and if so is the improvement of taste truly drastic or minor,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6510037183761597, 0.20144307613372803, 0.1475532054901123]"

3695,interesting that the delonghi you have wa so different from mine i just recently purchased mine is stainless steel which compared to others i have used give it a slight increase in weight which allows me to remove the portafilter one handed provided the bottom is griping the benchtop properly also the removable drip tray ha a nice i assume stainless steel cover underneath so that mug and larger cup do not just sit in the plastic bottom which is a nice feature to be included just found it interesting that there were some difference that may or may not have caused a different opinion of it edit by the way after just an hour or so about going through the setting setting the water temp etc i think the difference between the stock shot i wa pulling and what i am able to pull now especially considering the change in coffee i have used is night and day,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.714526355266571, 0.15637895464897156, 0.1290946751832962]"

3718,mason chamberlain the 9 psi opv spring is relatively easy to replace just need a screwdriver to take the lid off the machine and a spanner of the right size to undo the bolt that hold the current factory spring in and put in the new spring and retighten bolt it make the machine run a little quieter a the pump is not working so hard and i find the shot come out more evenly and gently taste seems more balanced and consistent on the shot a the shot pull at a slightly lower pressure for slightly longer the pid is a lot more work to mod but i also recommend it to get much better temperature control and stability the other easy mod to consider would be the silicone group head gasket a it make inserting and removing the brew basket smoother and easier over the factory rubber gasket that get harder over time and the stainless steel group head mod note some newer machine already come with the steel group head over the earlier aluminum head that wa stock on the earlier machine the steel head is heavier easier to clean and will maintain better brew head temperature stability too good luck,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7114908695220947, 0.19546449184417725, 0.09304465353488922]"

3729,hey james here is the thing about gaggias at least from a personal standpoint somewhere in the 2percent area of your knowledge espresso shot a you said great potential with really nice grind i use it paired with eureka mignon and i could pull amazing shot with proper temp surfing which you start to get it right once you have had already a longer term relationship with your espresso machine milk here is the strangest part i had to return my initial gaggia classic pro because the milk pressure wa really bad with the new one i am quite satisfied and still learning about it daily gaggia ha to work on their q amp a let me further expand the subject with gaggia you really need to be quick the first 4 5 second are really the most important part of the frothing after the initial purge gaggia is a wild a silvia in the beginning so if you air it out right then you use the rest of it for stretching getting godly silky smooth milk to get to that level you really need to know your machine and even if you are basically the most known coffee person on youtube you might face some consistency issue in the beginning also a strange part is that the steam pressure is not consistent and i have found it tied to some routine operation like purge wand right after 10 second when you start the steam heat i have not yet discovered the 100percent approach but still working on it gaggia is like a moody wife you need to start listening to her more see what she like see what she doe not and if you tick all the right box you will have a great time also gaggia is the most stylish machine out of them all at least this is what i feel about my matte black chrome gaggia paired with the matte black eureka throw in a black rhino ware pitcher and you got a really nice set great video a this will clearly help work from home people to pick the right machine for them covid 19 is the reason i started to switch from a coffee drink consumer to an amateur barista status and clearly your content guided me through the journey,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.4927483797073364, 0.4099433124065399, 0.09730826318264008]"

3837,i bought the delonghi dedica a couple of month back and it is been a bit of a mixed bag to be honest i bought a non pressurized basket which ha made a bit of a difference compared to the pressurized it is also meant i can grind a bit finer a the pressurized really struggle with a fine ground and just clog up there is three temperature setting and found the hottest one to be the most effective a the standard temperature that is programmed is just a bit too cool for me for the milk steaming i removed the silver wand and just use the rubber wand underneath though have had to use a cable tie to keep that in place a otherwise it pop off that is made a world of difference to the milk texture though overall i am pretty happy with the machine and the price i paid for it a in this instance you do get what you pay for it is been a good starter machine but i will be upgrading a and when budget and counter space oh and wife allows,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.703731119632721, 0.18734245002269745, 0.10892634093761444]"

3857,thanks to james i did take the plunge in a new hobby and habit after a lot of research wound up with the breville in u s bambino after investing in a good grinder sette 270wi i do think i can better my skill and move to full manual mode rather than the automated setting which you can also adjust i do tend to feel like shot come out a little sour and my fix to that is to start the clock after first drip not upon hitting start or preinfusion so about 8 9 second on preinfusion 10 second to first drop and if i can dial into 2 1 at somewhere around 33 36 second i feel like i have moved the bar to a more balanced shot i read and watch many conflicting opinion about this but that is what i have found so far wonder what james would say about this the only thing i can not seem to control is shot temperature i am going to guess it is on the cooler side even after trying to warm up the basket i steam the milk at the second setting which warms up a latte or cappuccino to a longer lasting adequate temp the milk steaming is fantastic in my opinion so i m satisfied with this little device and the space saving is also another advantage cheer,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6443772315979004, 0.26774588227272034, 0.08787690848112106]"

3895,hi i have had the delonghi dedica for a few month and completely agree with the review and out of the box the espresso is simply sub par but with a few mod you can really pull some great espresso and cappuccino firstly i took of the automated steamer and used just the tip secure the wand with some tape or zip tie a it can blow off and you can get some good micro foaming going a some other comment suggested you can get bottomless portafilter with unpressurised basket included for very cheap off ali express granted delivery will take a while they are surprisingly good quality and really help dial in your shot you can take the drip tray off to reveal another smaller tray that scale can be placed on although you may need tiny scale run a double shot or two through the basket before adding your coffee to heat it up this will pull a much hotter shot and have better extraction i managed to get one off amazon refurbished for around gbp75 and including another second hand grinder i rebuilt i managed to get a set up for gbp150 that make in my opinion great quality coffee albeit with quite a bit of fiddling but a i am far too poor for a proper setup beggers can not be chooser one day i will buy a proper setup but for now it will do nicely,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6614702343940735, 0.19591078162193298, 0.14261898398399353]"

3898,the most common mod you can find are the pid and the 9bar opv change i know the 9bar is very very simple to do on the level of opening the machine removing some pipe unscrewing a thing changing the spring then putting everything back together and ha a dramatic improvement on coffee quality look up mr shade he ha a store that sell that stuff a well a youtube video on how to do it look up 9 bar mr shade tutorial on youtube and you will see how ridiculously easy it is,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8380272388458252, 0.1519385427236557, 0.010034158825874329]"

4003,kerem a you probably understand i am no expert and not really qualified to give any meaningful advice if you still want my input i can think out loud first i would figure out how many customer and how much coffee you have potential to sell in peak hour from that you need to determine what your ambition are is it good enough to serve some hot brown drink or do you want to be a high end shop will you serve coffee to take away or only seated customer i imagine coffee to go customer are more in a hurry delay may not be acceptable will you offer both single and double shot coffee in that case you may want to look at a dual brew head machine what if the machine break down can you afford to stop serving while getting the machine fixed maybe you need a professional service agreement that guarantee next day repair do you have time to refill the water tank and empty the spill tray or do you need a plumbed in machine my gaggia kept giving me problem several time a valve wa blocked with some coffe ground the water flow almost stopped and the coffee tasted crap got bored of disassembling the machine to clean out the valve i now use a prosumer machine bezzera unica pid it is a single boiler dual use machine like the one tested here perfect for me who only drink espresso le than ideal for milk based drink if i wa a milk drinker i probably would have bought a heat exchanger hx machine it can deliver coffee and steam without the wait but is le temperature stable and may need purging to get correct brew temperature for home use that is fine if the coffee taste bad you can always make a new cup for a professional service that could ruin reputation example rocket appartamento a dual boiler is more expensive but ha separate system for coffee and steam and with a pid digital temperature controller you can be reasonably sure the temperature will be correct example izzo myway alex duetto and rancilio silvia pro edit this is the brand new big brother of the silvia tested in this video there are a ton of macines to choose from in this price range most if not all are good but have different strength and weakness hope someone with more relevant experience can give you some sound advice good luck english is not my first language but i hope this wa understandable greeting from norway,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.39948785305023193, 0.36756616830825806, 0.2329459935426712]"

4135,the bambino here in new zealand is breville rather than sage and only come with the dual wall pressurised basket unless you want to buy pre ground coffee you should 100percent get standard basket here you can buy them directly from breville for approx dollar12 other than the machine being so light and moving around when locking in the portafilter i have loved using it it wa my first espresso machine so i have learned a lot with it but once i ha the standard basket decent bean and got the hang of dialling my shot i wa very impressed with the coffee i could get from it a james said it wa a good machine to learn manual steaming on but the automatic steaming also make it easy enough for visitor to use my young niece love making their own hot chocolate like the one at the cafe another bonus is how quickly it is ready to go literally second and thr water is up to temp unfortunately my bambino died a couple of month ago after having it for le than 1 year due to a disagreement between the service agent and the ship from where i bought it basically over 6 week since it went to them for repair and it had not been touched i got a full refund they had none in stock to replace it and doe not look like they are getting more in any time a their system said the line is finished i have found a couple of chain store still selling them online but they also no longer have them in store i am currently torn whether to get another one or go for something like the sylvia but that is twice the price of the bambino here dollar1300 to dollar1500 v dollar580 to dollar750 respectively which put the breville the infuser in between them in price but closer to the bambino however it look like you then lose the automatic milk frothing while keeping the pre infusion with the infuser but the le then great look or build quality that you get with thre sylvia,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.5684038400650024, 0.22187834978103638, 0.20971786975860596]"

4205,enjoyed that i have the rancillo silva myself and when i got it at first i ruined more coffee than i thought possible there is a bit of a learning curve with it and figuring out it is foible i wa coming from a cheap delonghi and with that i used to steam my milk then pull my espresso but when i did that with the silva the espresso wa burnt most of the time being a single boiler it get very hot on the steam setting and take a while to cool back down so i had to reverse the process pull a shot then switch to steam it also took a long time to dial in the grind size it wa far more unforgiving than the delonghi too fine and it squeeze out undrinkable tar and too coarse and you get watery blegh but not i have all those thing figured out i am getting very good tasty and consistent shot and smooth and velvet milk in my flat white the steam wand is definitely the star of the show it froth milk so much better than any other consumer level machine i have ever used and for that it wa worth the time spent getting used to it,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.8554335236549377, 0.07435321807861328, 0.07021325826644897]"

4207,had a dedica it ha 3 water temp i found you had to go to the hottest setting the medium default temp is too cool also the best steaming is by removing the panarello wand and using the rubber inner single hole tube hold it on with a plastic tie wrap or it will blow off in your milk you can play with the timing of the steam switch but i got pretty good milk texture that way in fact this wa how i learned to steam milk the panarello wa not useful when i had this model i did not have a great hand grinder and i would easily choke the machine which created quite a mess i ended up having to remove a screw to take off the screen and clean the coffee grind i cursed this unit and only kept it about 3 month before upgrading today a pid should not be an expensive addition option although the silvia pro with pid is dollar2200 here in canada much too expensive,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.4978950023651123, 0.4164014756679535, 0.08570355921983719]"

4321,right on target rancilio and gaggia are the best option around that price range i have the gaggia for almost an year and it is all true it wa significan notly cheaper than the rancilio at the time here in canada so i think i made the right choice a i drink pure espresso way more often i would be disappointed buying anything that could not handle at least that fine grind i actually expected the gaggia to handle finer grind when i bought the gaggia there wa an option to have a pid installed by the seller but it wa a bit expensive good entry level machine but yeah you will get frustrated with the lack of temperature and pressure control milk frothing can indeed be inconsistent a new basket is a must you can easily find bottomless portafilters to use a scale and bigger cup i will stick to it until i can afford a decent,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.44879093766212463, 0.4445638656616211, 0.1066451445221901]"

4385,daniel moriss jeffery no problem happy if my suggestion help even the smallest bit please tell me if i am rambling though i do not want to bore you or come across a a know all grind is very important especially with non pressurised filter basket so if you really want to get better espresso more consistently having your own grinder is important i use a baratza encore with a small mod to enable it to grind fine enough for the unpressurised system electric grinder on the cheaper end of the scale probably will not be suitable for what you need it for and even some of the more expensive are made with a focus on grind consistency for a coarser grind for brewing method such a v60 filter but are not great for espresso it is worth doing some research and reading review if the thought of spending almost the price of the coffee machine again on a grinder put you off i am sure you could get a good manual grinder for le than gbp euro dollar100 it is a delicate balance getting the quantity of coffee fineness of grind and firmness of tamp correct if the coffee is too fine it is very easy to overtamp a bit of adjustment is to be expected when wouldialling in different coffee anyway even a the coffee age it may be necessary to grind a little bit finer to get a better extraction this is a great reason for having your own grinder that and of course the freshness each time you grind if you can persist and iron out some of these issue finding what work best for you i have no doubt the result will be worth it regarding the steam wand yes i feel it is been a worthwhile modification i have found a little technique in getting a nice steady flow of steam from the machine and with the proper frothing technique the milk is just that bit more textured more glossy and in the right hand not mine yet can make great latte art i will say that it wa frustrating at first because it took a while to get used to and the panarello already make decent milk just not quite a good a with the rancilio wand it is a toss up between the effort required and getting that little bit extra out of the machine,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.476991206407547, 0.26750242710113525, 0.2555064260959625]"

4437,i recently bought the gaggia and i would concur with your assessment it take a fair bit of effort to get decent milk texture i am not ready to mod it just yet but i am glad to know that is a fixable issue one thing i am concerned about is that the steam wand valve tends to leak a bit do not know if that is normal i am very glad i did not go with the dedica the price made it tempting but clearly i would not have been happy with it,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5168381929397583, 0.38974541425704956, 0.09341639280319214]"

4543,i have been using gaggia classic pro for almost two month now and i spent the first couple week getting to know the machine at factory setting i have to say my experience with the steamer is totally different from yours i thought the steamer wa very powerful and it worked the milk almost too fast for me part of it probably due to the fact that i usually steam only small amount for piccolo and the milk rose to the desired temperature so fast that it wa a bit hard to get proper milk texture at first note that i live in thailand and the model sold here could be a bit different after couple week i installed the opv mod spring to switched to 9 bar and loved it a week later i installed pid controller both mod actually came at the same time but i decided to install one at a time to see how much each of them affect the machine is performance and i got two thing out of it the shot are now very consistent because i now know what temperature i am brewing with and no more surfing the second benefit is that the pid also control steamer temperature so i adjusted it to be a bit le powerful about 140c not sure what is the factory set up wa but it wa higher for sure so i have more time to steam my small portion of milk all thing considered i have to say i am very happy with my gcp and a bit surprised to see it came in last in the steaming race love your review though and i have to say i knew from the get go you would pick gcp and miss silvia lol,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.5054822564125061, 0.30077871680259705, 0.19373907148838043]"

4549,well i actually have one of these in a way at least so i am able to finally chime in my machine which i purchased earlier this year for eur 519 90 would be the lelit anita or pl042temd to give it it correct designation it is a slight step up from the entry level anna that you tested the most noticable difference of course being the inbuilt grinder more on that later the anita also come with pressure gauge toggle switch a much improved steaming wand and a pid i had to add a bottomless porta filter distribution tool and tamper for the lelit is non standard 57mm design i did look into better basket which are available but have not yet decided to get one your vidoe will probably result in me ordering one okay so the grinder really is not that great not a surprise but certainly frustrating especially when you are just starting to get serious about your espresso in the end i gave in and bought a commandante which doe a much better job at grinding for espresso based drink the lelit grinder still get use for coarser setting like vietnamese phin drip filter coffee or the mokka pot though actually i wa not that interested in having an inbuilt grinder to begin with it is simply the only machine in this price range at least with a steam wand on the left side which did matter to me so doe it make decent espresso absolutely no problem frothing milk either thanks to the better steam wand it is still a single hole design but omni directional and well it just seems to work fine no issue regarding pressure or temperature either the other weak design choice which you pointed out are of course valid but in general it is a very capable little machine for the beginner mistake are repeatable no electronics to hide anything from the user and overall solid build quality it did take me two or three month to finally get to a point where i am happy with what i can do with it and the coffe it produce often far better than what pass a espresso in coffee bar okay i do invest in fresh high quality locally roasted bean too,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.533064067363739, 0.2884024381637573, 0.17853347957134247]"

4683,great review james i have always dreamed of a rancilio silvia it continues to stand out from the crowd a the most affordable proper espresso machine i am always looking out for second hand one but people seem to keep them once they have got them which is a good sign i guess interesting to hear about the ecosystem of rancilio user that is a big plus i had not thought of oh well back to my moka pot for now cheer,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6959032416343689, 0.18296028673648834, 0.12113643437623978]"
4684,gaggia classic take is spot on opv mod is absolutely necessary in order to get good shot out of this machine and definitely the steam pressure be something to be desired a there is just not enough however i think these machine last forever a long a you take care of them which is great and plus you can pick up one of these used for cheap which would give you the budget to add a pid get a new steam wand to replace the steam one on the older one buy a new basket buy a bottomless portafilter and just improve it and be at a lower price point then the rancilio however if i wa able to get a rancilio at a lower price point say dollar200 i would probably buy and switch over just for the steaming power because i make milk drink all day long,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.4495941400527954, 0.4200158715248108, 0.1303899735212326]"

4730,thanks mr james i have been waiting to know your opinion on these machine for a while now and you delivered a usual i own the same rancilio silvia and yes the temperature issue is super annoying after many decade rancilio solved this by creating the pro version with pid temperature control which is way more expensive and at that price point there is more competition congrats on the eagle prima truly amazing,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7449331879615784, 0.1458629071712494, 0.10920391976833344]"

4899,thanks for the video james i recently upgraded from the bambino plus to the silvia and the thing i had noticed the bambino wa very very finnicky to dial in it required coffee to be ground uncomfortably coarse and the result with very lightly roasted melbourne coffee wa subpar i also found that it could not maintain 9 bar of pressure consistently and led to many very frustrating brew the silvia is a tinkerer is dream built like a tank like you said i do not mind temperature surfing or the fact that it is a single boiler after a while flushing surfing becomes part of your routine in the same way that pre heating the portafilter doe one last thing is that sage product at least in australia a breville very often go on sale accordingly the bambino plus is placed at a very similar price point to that of the delonghi in australia check ozbargin for deal it often go for dollar350 aud 196 gbp at that price point it is significan notly cheaper than the silvia or gaggia and for someone who similar to me want to investigate if they want to adopt a pet called an espresso machine it is a strong recommendation however for someone who know espresso know what is involved in making it at home i would steer clear away from the bambino plus if possible while it can make decent espresso it can not really make great espresso and you will waste of much coffee trying to get to great espresso that it will not be worth it not a joy to use and not worth the hassle,"['video', 'not usability', 'usability']","[0.40664854645729065, 0.3007771372795105, 0.29257437586784363]"

4902,curious if you can control preinfusion on any of the machine that required coarser grind i have a flair and a you know it is a much smaller basket that typically requires a coarser grind because of the deeper puck but the trick for them is to go ahead and grind finer anyways and do a longer preinfusion and also end up with a longer total shot time in the 45 60 second area just curious if something like the bambino for instance can control preinfusion enough to make it work for light roast also maybe i missed it but are some of these machine getting a more in depth video that includes mod i almost thought you would cover it at the end of the video but i know it wa running a bit long,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8594084978103638, 0.09317188709974289, 0.047419626265764236]"

5182,the rancilio clearly take the cake here or would take the cake rather since for only 30 buck more you can get a bezzera hobby which since the last update is better in every regard bringing much better temperatur stability a copper boiler commercial group head etc a comment on the lelit for a few buck more you can get this with a pid and a real steam wand not sure if the boiler is bigger on that one but i reckon and read report the steam performance will be improved nonetheless since the anna wand really is sub par and more of a byproduct of the panarello rather than a wand that is supposed to be used for steaming another thing to note the lelits are a pain to service repair on the anna it is kinda ok since there is not much inside but any of the bigger machine are just a nightmare there are repair shop over here that refuse to even open those machine but still they make suprisingly good coffee for the price and i know of two machine that have been running for over 6 year now without a hitch and i do not think they even have been descaled once so at that price point you litteraly can dump them in the trash and buy a new one when they fail,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.717159628868103, 0.19331589341163635, 0.08952443301677704]"

5288,delonghi dedica tip you can remove the panarello steam cover off the wand to expose a rubber nozzle that is better for steaming micro foam than the stock or you can replace it with a silvia steam wand off ebay temp surf using the steam button to cycle it on and off make sure to flush the machine with hot water after heating up steam while temp surfing if you do this before each espresso it make it far more consistent you can also do the temp surf cycle above to get hotter steam steam button on steam off flush hot water till the light stop flashing to have hotter steam use a toothpick to break up clunk this machine is really finicky and the slightest fault in your ground bed can mess it up use a toothpick or other tool to break up small clump before tamping lastly make sure your water is at room temp in the water bin at the back of the machine if it is cold water the brew temp will be too cold and you will get sour espresso use filtered scale free water to reduce need for descaling for all machine pour boiled water from kettle onto metal end of portafilter to preheat it for hotter water for more extraction also there are 3 temperature setting and 3 hardness setting on the machine i suggest using setting 3 for a light roast,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7474997043609619, 0.16843640804290771, 0.08406390249729156]"

5389,another tip is to use medium to dark coffee but more in the dark side since the temp is no so high to use light to medium roast however i am using a hack to increase temp a follows push the steam bottom wait to be ready to steam then turn off the machine and turn on run the preinfusion cycle without the portafilter and stop the cycle when finish the preinfusion then insert the portafilter and do the espresso extraction a normal i do not have a fast response termometer but it seems the water temp is higher that way judging by the espresso flavor i get,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8477914333343506, 0.09497357904911041, 0.057235028594732285]"

5391,rincon that is a very cool idea i just tried it and the espresso seems noticeably hotter i am going to experiment with this hack the upcoming day and document my result,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6308498382568359, 0.2971459627151489, 0.07200423628091812]"
5392,hi tom i am increasing the temp stability a follows remove the spring from the portafilter put coffee ground directly in the basket with out the portafilter when done i put the portafilter without the basket in the machine and run two cycle of water to warm up the portafilter put the basket in the portafilter and wait 15 20 sec to warm the basket and finally do a normal extraction i do not have a termometer probe a you have but the coffee is now better the idea of removing the spring is to insert without effort the basket avoiding to generate crack in the puck,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.725102961063385, 0.20081059634685516, 0.074086494743824]"
5393,tom is coffee corner the basket is in contact with the portafilter and the coffee with the basket so a soon the puck receive hot water it will cool down via the basket and the portafilter water temp is key for a good extraction for medium roast coffee water should be around 92 degree thats why i am preheating the portafilter and using the temp increase hack if you still have a stock portafilter would be interesting to see a graph of temp versus time,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6908013820648193, 0.24369357526302338, 0.06550497561693192]"
5394,a rincon i think the best thing is to use a bottomless then the espresso can not come into contact with anything at a lower temperature plastic portafilters are bad because even if you try preheating them they do not retain the heat the is one big downside to the portafilter of the bambino plus,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5233294367790222, 0.322776734828949, 0.1538938581943512]"
5395,tom is coffee corner interesting but anyway the problem is the portafilter will drain the temp in the puck so need to be hot before the extraction have you seen an all plastic portafilter that would solve the problem too or an isolation with the basket but this could be challenging,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5667706727981567, 0.3371286690235138, 0.09610063582658768]"

5534,i personalised the amount of water for a double shot i press the 2 cup button i recommend you to stop the shot in order to get the amount of coffee you like according the coffee ratio you want for example if you like 1 2 ratio you start with 14g of coffee and you stop the shot at around 28g of coffee do not let the machine till the end a it may be too long that is probably why your coffee is sour,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8174009323120117, 0.1262936145067215, 0.056305453181266785]"
5535,very pleasing video to watch i like the aesthetic a lot for your coffee setup i would hightly highly recommend some modification 1 get an unpressurized basket or even better a new bottomless portafilter 2 unfortunately you will have to get a new grinder the kg521 can not grind fine enough to produce a decent espresso maybe some super dark roasted bean might work but you will be very limited 3 weight after grinding unless you get a single dose grinder you lost 2 6g this way the kg521 ha a lot of dead space 4 you want to have a ratio around 1 1 5 1 2 5 of dose to espresso in the cup e g 14g should give you 28g coffee and when timing i would aim for a little slower because of the pre infusion time of the ec695 5 before making the first coffee always do an empty run without the portafilter installed of water into you cup the temperature of the water after turning on the machine will otherwise be too inconsistent and it also help with cleaning the machine and the water pre heat your cup 6 optional if you want to make any milk based drink you should replace the panarello wand an intermediate solution is to just take the panarello off and lock the plastic wand below into place using a zip tie the panarello can not produce microfoam you will always get too fluffy big bubbely milk,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.7600644826889038, 0.20083880424499512, 0.03909674286842346]"

5949,adding my voice to the dedica is cause i have had one for about five year at least 3 double espresso milk drink every day never needed repair so far bought a 3rd party bottomless and therefore non pressurised basket and holder grind my own coffee with a relatively cheap but good enough wellhome grinder consistently delicious shot plenty of crema i have the 680 so do not have the variable wand i believe the model demonstrated is the same a mine there is some technique to frothing milk and while i can not do latte art with what is produced i have a decent micro foam not the insane bubble bath a shown at it price point i feel the dedica is a good fit for anyone who want to take their coffee more seriously but is not ready to start weighing their dos you can pull a better shot on other machine but it is a big hike in price and it is more involved not saying anyone should not do this or indeed that i will not do this in the future but upon waking up the first thing i do is stumble over to the dedica and through my still half asleep haze throw together a flat white capuccino latte hybrid that beat the flavor of any chain coffee shop non pressurised bottomless basket holder bit of time getting the grind size right bit of time getting the extraction time right once you have got that set you will have delicious coffee in a very short amount of time with the least fuss,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7919232845306396, 0.13506421446800232, 0.07301250845193863]"

5953,i have the delonghi and i have had it for about 3 year and i make about 2 to 3 double shot of espresso just about every day since i purchased it i can attest to the quality of the machine because it a workhorse and have never had to replace anything on it since the purchase i grind my own bean in a baratza sette 270i and i produce wonderful espresso with nice crema unlike what we saw in this video she did mention that she expected it to have been a better performance for this showdown so it is ok and for the frother if you use it all the time you will know your machine and how it froth and you can switch to steamed milk setting on the wand and work it manually like a traditional wand and produce thicker smoother froth on your milk i love my delonghi due to the quality and heartiness of my machine i think i would buy stinkin car made by them if they made one haha have a great day,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.6163392663002014, 0.2942444086074829, 0.08941633254289627]"
