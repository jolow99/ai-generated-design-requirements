up the great work would love to know the original sound track used here very calming,it is cool but usually le is more is this something you really do everyday,curious why you would use your e685m when you have a lmm there,cuanta gilipolleces para tomar un caf,hi i have a question every one of my coffee is terribly sour every type of coffee is sour i tried change the temperature pressure and non pressure sieve different type of water i decalcified the coffee machine with the original preparation and also with vinegar i do not know where the mistake may be anymore can you please help me i am already desperate i own a delonghi dedica ec685 m coffee machine and a delonghi grinder kg521 m,have you tried different bean,you have the single shot button programmed a a double have you tried bottomless portafilter for the dedica and have you noticed the pump is not strong enough to get water through too finely ground bean on my breville grinder i have to do it about a 13 14 because if i go below an 11 the pump can not get any water through lol,this is the mo artly commercial i ever saw damn,5 min to make a coffee it a joke,why are you using a delonghi while standing next to a la marzocco,wait you have a marzocco and use a de longhi to make coffee,this is so satisfying,,,what is this soundtrack,como diria o saudoso casimiro mermao se esse maluco faz isso todo dia pra tomar um caf eu sou um chamyto,the temping is really uneven the way you do it,nice i love ur stye vinyl and coffee is also my mood i even bought vinyl player to match it up while taking a sip of my coffee,could you please share what song is playing in this video neither shazam nor audiotag recognize it edit found it here is the info for anyone else wanting to track it down song fascination performed by japanese mandolinist masao koga at first i thought it wa guitarist antonio koga album screen mood koga guitar romantica 1965 compilation of film music arranged by makoto saeki song originally written by fermo dante marchetti in 1905 record label nippon columbia jps 5024,i am learning i love coffe,hey im totally new into this with my delonghi 685 i just bought lavazza coffe bean caffe crema grinded it and put it into my portafilter i noticed that it very fluid and not really creamy what im doing wrong is this crema only given by using espresso bean,you might need to a grind finer b get a fresher bag of bean from the coffee store instead of supermarket,a question how did you change that steamer i bought a new one but the steamer is different,yes he changed it it is the rancilio silvia steamwand it is definetly a really good upgrade,life s to short for bad coffee,this wa a whole vibe dude your video are amazing keep up the great work,do u use the standard filter or other,imagine being that slow,the steam wand is not the original one i suspect where did you get this upgraded one,hey there what song is this,un video molto rilassante sento il profumo di caff,oh mate speed up life is too short,nice video 18g coffee in one shot usually in youtube coffee master take 14g per double shot what filter basket do you use i can not see it in equipment list,nico hey i also have a dedica and i am not able to fill it with nearly 16g of fine grain or the liquid just doe not pass through what is your way of doing it in consequence,nico fair i have a magica with 58mm portafilter thus i go with 18g but i would rather lower the dose and keep the ratio than change the ratio unless you prefer a different ratio then go for it,patbm2811 not for a 52 mm basket if i grind for a ratio around 2 1 and put 18 gramm in my dedica usually suffocates,18g for a double shot is actually pretty standard most will range between 17 20g 14g is a rather small double shot especially if you consider the normal 2 1 ratio he ha a quite short ratio with 18g in and 28g out making it a mix between espresso and ristretto go for a 18g in 36 40g out for your double shot if you want to be somewhat safe or even better experiment a long a you got exactly what you like best but always enjoy,cool but why do you need the scale after putting the coffee in the espresso machine i understand that you need to measure how much you put in the machine but after that i do not get it is use,he wanted to measure the amount of brewed coffee usually ppl is looking for 1 2 ratio so 18g ground coffee and try to get 36g of brewed coffee in this case he got about 30g so about 1 1 7 ratio,i looooove the little scale what s the brand it doesnt look like classic kitchen scale,you have a good set up however what you did is a ristretto am i right 18 2g of grind to 30 1g of liquid resulting to a 1 1 6 ratio thank you,pretty much thought the same thing,did you change the nozzle of milk frother,yes he did,i love the classic brazilian music perfect with coffee,great video just out of curiosity why do you still have a dedica when you also have a la marzocco a linea mini from the look of it any reason for keeping both,igor versiani i use linea for small pitcher a well and i get perfect result,my guess dedica warms up much quicker and linea mini is steam pressure is too much for such a small pitcher,hi how do i change the wand to a more progressional one without the bulky tip,you can get a rancilio silva steaming wand which you can put into this machine it is a bit of a pain though,i m interested too,link to get your steamer wand please hate cleaning the stock wand,i think it is the rancillio after market but a link would be nice,hello i got a question do you turn the steamer to cappuccino or hot milk option for doing latte art i tried the way you did a couple of time but failed to do art on the surface of the espresso however i made a single espresso how many gram of milk do i need or how many second shall i steam the milk shall it be foamy or intense could you please help me,hey ive been having problem a well i would definitely use the hot milk option for latte art with the cappucino option your foam will get to stiff and dry in my experience,i believe he is replaced the stock steamer with the rancilio silvia steam wand,i do so,remove the cover from the wand just leave the black rubber part it should help with foaming,he ha a upgraded machine his steamer is not to compare with the one included to the machine the one wich is included there is not much of a difference between the two option but anyway try to angle the steamer and just let it dip into the milk not to deep try to create a little vortex without putting to much air into it silky and smooth it should be not foamy and stiff xd,which coffee bean do you use any recommendation for good coffee bean,for espresso it best to use coffee between 2 6 week after roasting,buy directly from the coffee roaster or a specialty cafe or from a online coffee store for an easier brew using espresso machine use medium dark to dark roasted coffee bean preferably a blend specifically made for espresso,gaya mutu keunggulan,hey arty i am using ec680 and my espresso always so watery what could be the problem,gavin chrisaputra late reply but the finer the grind the more pressure it need to get through the coffee thus having a longer extraction time try to shoot for 25 second on average with a ratio from 1 to 2 5 for espresso so 18g of grinded bean to 45g of espresso,seyed ahh okay thanks for the info bro,make sure that the bean are grinded right,how many ml of milk,arty home thanks a lot,160 ml,what is the song name,arty home thank you,song fascination f d marchetti album screen mood koga guitar romantic arr m saeki,hmm relaxing what is that basket you are usung mine is a lot smaller,04 20,18 2 g is to mach,i use a non pressurized portafilter with that you can get a perfect sharp and creamy espresso,instablaster,whats the title of the song bro,what is model of weighing scale,2021 ver i guess,timeore,what pitcher size are you using,how big is your portafilter,hey great video i got the same machine with the original frother my milk is sometimes too bubbly any tip,replace the steamer wand with a different one,do you time the extraction by yourself because the machine ha pre set extraction time in it,you can customize the extraction time but holding down either button for a long a you want,what temperature configuration do you use saludos de chile,i use middle,someone said time counter should be started at 1st drip however someone said time counter should be started when pressing the ec685 coffee button i would like to know which one is correct many thanks,just ha to be a reference,i think it work for both which method do you like use that method,hey i could need some advice i am using the delonghi with a bottomless portafilter but i always get espresso that taste a bit sour i only have a graef cm 702 grinder but at the finest setting even with really light tamp the machine can not press enough water through the coffee when adjusting the grind i got a seemingly perfect shot 17g in 25g out in 27 no channeling but i still have some sourness i used two different type of coffee so i do not think that the coffee is a problem also the two were quite dark roast do you have anny tipps advice i would highly appreciate it thanks,it can also be a temperature issue unless you have temperature control try to preheat the system a much a possible,you try to increase the amount of ground coffee more,great work your video are very relaxing could you write the soundtrack playlist in the description thanks,yes the soundtrack please,arty home yes can you please add the soundtrack music in the description a i can not find any so lovely to listen it while you make and drink your beautiful coffee xx,thank you,hi where i can buy the little metal cup where you put the grinded coffee and later put in the the filter,from ebay you search stainless steel 2oz cup,nice i see your ec685 have other cappuccinatore than my can you confirm thx,i have a problem with my delonghi in which the espresso doe not pour out beautifully but rather in drip doe anybody know how to fix,it flow slowly or quickly grind the coffee bean too finely or too rough,very very veryyyyy cool,great jobd man,i have the same machine it doe not make the foam properly i followed many tip and video but it never bring the foamy milk like the one you got i am not sure if you used the same foam you got fr the dedica,hi could you share your setup i use the same dedica with normal portafilter and 2 cup basket but no chance to put 18gramms of grind coffe into it and somehow single shot time is only 15 17 but somehow i get more than 70grams of extract so ratio is more than 4 i watched many video but could not figure out what is the problem any idea thx in advance and sorry know i am newbie,got a 51mm non pressurized filter basket on amazon took out the black plastic part it fit perfectly i can live with the screw third hole for better coffee good coffee bean fine grind size even distribution and tamp your espresso will be perfecto,i have had the same problem with you with the default portafilter coming with delonghi dedica coffee machine the maximum capacity this portafilter get is about 14gr of not so finely ground coffee in the 2 cup basket i have tried with finer grind and wa able to put in 18gr of coffee but the result wa not being able to extract proper espresso shot only after changing to non pressurized portafilter i have managed to extract proper espresso shot with really fine ground coffee here arty home ha modified the default portafilter to fit the non pressurised basket i believe a non pressurized basket the one with multiple instead of one whole in conjunction with finely ground coffee is your solution,i think a good grinder and fine grinding will help you,filip cicmansky thx what did you bought sell this and buy an other one still an option a i drink just espresso and cappuccino,most likely your grinder isnt fine enought i had the same problem u til i invested into proper espresso grinder around gbp200 i would auggest going to a coffee shop and asking them to grind you a dose and trying to extract it with your portafilter at home,loving your video and i appreciate your workflow mine for my dedica is similar but i do not have a nice of a grinder so i usually do the water spritz trick when i load my single dose into the hopper because i get slightly worse static you took the plastic insert out of your portafilter right how did you prevent the drip from the middle hole and still fit the basket in,i cut off the top of the plastic you can watch the video,u are using stock portafilter with a dfferent busket may u explain more on your setup thanks,i want you to watch video on my channel then you will understand

your product,absolute rubbish it is ok if you want 10 mil of coffee bring my breville espresso machine back out best coffee ever half the price give me a call delonghi if you think i am bad in your full slamming your product,da come esce il caff deve essere una schifezza schiuma bianca,worst espresso ever seen,hello i have a delonghi d dica ec685 for a couple of month now however i am always in trouble to take a coffee right if fill the compartment with grounded coffee using the right measure that is available with the machine then a press the coffee just a bit with the right tool however the machine doe not take any coffee i need to use le coffee than the right measure to take a coffee doe this happen to you guy any suggestion of what is happening thank you,yep just bought this machine i had a breville coffee machine best expresso machine on ever had big hype about this delonghi it is absolute rubbish,before i got a benchtop grinder i used to use regular bagged coffee this never got me good result till i bought espresso ground coffee which is more finely ground i can get this at the shop i just have to read the label correctly a for tampering i press quite firmly to remove any airgaps so that it a compact puck work a charm for me what i do is fill the basket with coffee till the brim more then 1 scoop of coffee the provided scoop give then i tamper it quite hard hope this help,v v not yet i think it is exactly the opposite the coffee is not grinded enough i will try other coffee,hey i too am facing the same problem have u found a solution,happy to see good coffee next time,,what kind of cofee wa that omg,you mean the coffee brand dallmayr classic,nice video and unboxing but you need to learn to properly make an expresso not adequate coffee with hole inside it is not the pressure you just have to pressure it evenly,thanks for the tip,not good,i must admit you really did not make this machine seem any good i have this machine and i am no barista but it actually is a good machine having said that when i first used it it did seem a bit crap now after learning it and some of it feature it make a great coffee i am quite lazy though and i use the ese pod save time and mess,banan muhammad you can take off the metal tube and just use the silicon one if you want to have complete control on how much steam you put in though you do need a little experience,banan muhammad i made 1 perfect steamed milk from this machine i started with push down the tube to cappuccino first for fist 5 sec of steaming process then push up to hot milk mode for the rest until you get temp that you want during the process of steaming have to tilt a jug a bit and let is the milk moving in circle you gon na get perfect milk for latte art,my steam tube is not working so well sometimes it is stopping just even 5 sec anyone have problem with it,can you have control of how to texturize the milk like not making it too foamy to have latte texture not cappuccino,how many mililiters should i get for 1 cup,steam cappuccino mode it work for like 4 5 second then it go off and then the single and the double coffee button blink on the machine it is a new machine what am i doing wrong here,dinesh nadar i have problem with steam mode too can you tell me how to solve it,surprise unboxing club ok so i wa not pushing the steam switch properly to the extreme right the reason it get stopped now sorted thank you for your reply,hi when the steam cappuccino mode is lightened press it then you can use the steam switch on the right side of the machine to get hot milk or foam when you release the switch all 3 button are lighting up again then you have to press the stram cappuccino mode again if you want to use it again but there is no time limit to use the steam cappuccino mode 4 5 second is definitely too le then i guess there is something wrong with it,1percent coffee 99percent milk,hehe exactly a lady coffee,solo le per la grandezza delle bolle che hai nella crema di latte dovresti vergognarti d,what is tamper diameter,51mm,,i made a creamy espresso using delonghi dedica with a non pressurized portafilter,artem yavorskyi eureka mignon is the grinder which i use it is good and compatible with many type of coffee machine,coffee nomad what grinder do you use,daniel 12345 i think i shall try it,i also use the dedica non pressurised with the sage dose control pro grinder the coffee is incredible,all what we need is a grinder and the perfect coffee bean,estas chavo,which is better this one or the ecp 35 31,very very light coffee did u drink that,hi it wa the first one i ever made i am still using this coffee machine daily but now i got some more experience with the right coffee bean it really taste not bad,my machine is having a problem making foam,i am having the same problem sometimes try to clean the milk frother this help me,with this piece of junk,thx for this video i needed,thank you luis happy to hear that,is this full stainless steel cause on other color like red or black seems plastic,lena t i got the stainless steel one it is all metal very high quality exceeded my expectation good machine but the milk frothing is a joke,it is partly plastic i think,also consider the new german wmf espresso lumero model also in even better quality own brand stainless steel it look very similar but more square in design anyone know if dl ha licenced it production to wmf a specification i think are exactly the same,that is not a good cup of coffee,gordan babi and it pressurised i non pressurised mine because the coffee tasted artificial with the stock pressurised basket,the goat pear it is underextracted 16 second it should be around 25 watery and no crema you can make way better cup of coffee with this machine but it required knowledge,why,like a barista mi cojones jajajajajajajajs,the coffee is not espresso soft grind it likely for brewed coffee thats why the extraction is not well enough nice unboxing vid and machine,thanks mohammed for the info that wa my first ever made coffee and with this machine i did not know when i unboxed it now i know,good machine bad barista,the shot is terrible ill probably look for another brand,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,my office have this one thats why i need to learn how to make it,good to hear hope this video help a bit with it,i have demo a video on how to make latte art,thanks,you are welcome glad to hear,crap demo,barista lol your coffee is watery tamping is bad and the overall finished drink look quite poor,v b forgetting a single letter ha nothing to do with spelling the title is misleading and the tutorial suck judging by the like dislike i am not the only one sorry for triggering you lol,first of all learn to spell and second of all stop hating people on the internet just because they are trying to help others out do not get me wrong i am very sorry that an internet tutorial channel did not meet your high standard,thats bad barista very light coffee,that tamping wa not great you could see the hole in the top of the puck the water would have channelled through this is why the shot wa so light in colour nice video though,pressurized basket do not need 30lb tamping like nonpressurized so i think the problem wa what the other viewer mentioned,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,pourquoi le connoisseur du caf ont parfois de cheveux argent s,everything i hoped it would be i love the simplicity of this keurig mybest kitchen i have had the old school original keurig for forever i decided to upgrade to button lol same great quality without having to measure your water this keurig doe all the thinking for you i also love not having to put water into the machine every time i want to use it simple and perfect,thx for your video i have a jura impressa s90 and want to change to a barista machine the problem you mentioned switching between coffee and steam you have with the most automatic coffee machine because the most of this machine have only one boiler too so this is not a real problem for someone who want to change to a barista system what i think about the dedica it not the best on the market but okay for those who start his barista experience and absolutely okay what you get for the price you can change to an expensive one later if you unsatisfied with your coffee machine,just a little point i can hear the british english you got taught popping through on certain word or is it australian,nice english congratz,wtf is that man that s not a real coffe change the setting on it and make a real shot the best machine can be the worst if the user doesn t know how to use it proper,,which is better this one or breville bambino,good point but you can purchase a bottomless portafilter non pressurized and choose the manual setting to time the shot you want from the delonghi,any recommendation please,andy love photography you long press on the shot button for how many second you want to pour best is between 25 30 second for a single shot but keep in mind that the machine doe a 1 2 second preinfuse,andy love photography i am trying to find info on that too,how would one do the manual setting i can not figure mine out,if you are going to review a product i guess at the very least you should have used it recently or remember clearly all feature the dedica while being a toy for any person who is serious about coffee with a couple of fairly simple modification can deliver great result with both coffee and milk thanks,stop fussing he did an excellent video,yeah i stopped watching he moment they said they have not used it in 6 month,spot on watching this after my first use if this machine ok third by the time i figured it out i think you nailed all the major hiccup need a separate grinder tough for making multiple cappuccino in a row and limited flexibility however for home use 1 or 2 drink at a time in conjunction with a grinder great machine for the price i like my american drip coffee and now i can crank out a great cappuccino for the lady with ease nice and small and fit great in my small kitchen would highly recommend for those with limited space fund and need,this dedica 785,is this better or smeg espresso,what is the other machine you have,merci pour le vid o je voulais savoir si je peux utiliser sans probl me un filtre classique non pressuris avec la delonghi dedica en adaptant le porte filtre videmment mais surtout est ce que la machine me permet de le faire correctement au niveau pression etc merci de me renseigner,the french review merci pour ta r ponse comme moulin j ai simplement un graef cm90,don karbone oui sans probleme tu peux acheter un non pressurise filtre sur amazon pour gbp10 et ca fonctionnera parfaitement oui cette machine peut delivrer jusqu a 15 bar de pressure et 9 suffira parfaitement je peux t envoyai un lien pour le basket si tu n est pa sur j envisage de refaire quelque video aussi sur cet machine tu pourras y jeter un oeil tu a quoi comme moulin,thank you so much for the review it gave me an overview,the french review i am about to it is currently out of stock here in the philippine i like the metal though,what did you end up doing did you buy it,uhhh plastic in the portafilter and the steam wand can be very bad for your health never drink hot liquid that passed through hot plastic,absolutely agree but the inner tubing are also plastic at this price point there is no choice at all you need to move to rancillo silva range to get copper tubing internal and full commercial portafilter the reason an old timer like rancillo is still in the market,a answer there is a plastic insert in the portafilter and it can be removed there are several youtube video on this process i do not know if this is where the bpa material is located,the older model doesnt have plastic they did that you can clean the basket,hey paul hope you good always thought the portafilter could be changed a it is not great it wa my first espresso machine at home which coffee machine do you know have,i have got this thank you,nice one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,doe anyone here have any knowledge on the delonghi ec785,it is good i like it,i have this model for it size it pack a punch pull great coffee even though the basket is pressurized,pretty good machine but my wife struggled with it definitely a learning curve for people who do not really have that passion for coffee,a great review i have enjoyed my delonghi i like it compact size it delivers good constant quality result,hello hope you can help me or someone can help me we are a home of 3 people that enjoy coffe some espresso some capuchino and some latte we are confused with what machine should we buy our option are this one the ec860 and de delonghi ec685m deluxe all your help will be appreiate it,shame about the steam wand people change for the recilio,i get far better result than that with the 40 pc robusta bean i have i get 2 third crema and a dark brown and red crema with most other bean i can not i have replaced the sieve with a normal one have used it for 3 year 3 time a day i grind my own coffee but it can also be used with senso or ese pad forgot to say ready in just a few minute not 20 like the stupidly expensive machine of my friend that get rubbish result,expected to see how the machine work got exactly that and a good laugh great job,why is it so difficult to move the filter holder from insert to close on the delonghi dedica,really like your way of presentation,what is it any diffirrent with ec785 gy recommand me pls for ec785 gy review video thanks,thanks for this review honestly the best video i watched smooth and clear explanation you go direct to the point,i wa curious if it is possible that james dedica wa set to a lower temperature setting since when i got myself a dedica it seems to be running really hot to the point where i ended up lowering the temperature setting it come with out of the box or perhaps it could be an issue with either the machine i got or the one he had,that woman is hilarious and amazing at the same time,good presentation but it is the worst espresso machine i have ever owned a machine i would owned fro 24 year finally gave up the ghost and at my age there is no point buying something expensive that will outlive me the dedica came highly recommended so much for that sorry it is a bad coffee maker if you are drawing 8 10 cappuccino a day,i find that the pump on this machine is very weak,hi i hv just decided to buy this machine because of your very nice review gail tks for sharing,thanks for the video very instructive,thanks for the demo got this machine it will be perfect for the apartment,coffee should not get in contact with aluminium and hot should not get in contact with plastic all this is ruining your health and influence immensely the taste of the coffee better to choose something more expensive with stainless steel upgrade top class professional gear doe not utilise aluminium nor plastic that may come in touch with coffee so let choose semiprofessional home appliences that take that philisophy after the best,sold,uhhh plastic in the portafilter and the steam wand can be very bad for your health never drink hot liquid that passed through hot liquid,miss you seriously made me laugh hahahhaha amazing video thanks a lot,hello thanks for video sorry l can not make first milk after that make coffee l do not know why l have to first make coffee my coffee machine same like that,i hope this thing is light year better than the delonghi stilosa which is a dumpster fire piece of crap a decent shot ai not happening i bought one and gave it a week before returning it,i too enjoyed the video perhaps you could also include how well the machine brew the espresso before adding the milk how wa the crema wa it a smooth shot wa it gritty otherwise thanks for helping buyer make better informed purchasing decision thanks,hi is this machine good for commercial use for start up small coffee shop,i have been having difficulty finding a good espresso coffee machine just for myself reading too many amazon review but came upon your review of this particular machine ha certainly made my choice a lot easier thanks,excellent gail bought one on your review love it you are a skilled presenter,i wish she would give me a hug,the video wa very interesting i enjoy espresso every day with delonghi is magnifica s i also subscribed to the channel please come visit me on my channel with love from japan,i love her,gail i just got one of these jan 2021 and wa looking for a tutorial demo video to learn how to use it thanks for a great informative and very entertaining video you had me at yeah it is me gail hiding behind these basket you rock thanks again,how doe the cup warmer activate,i would die for this woman,delonghi dedica 685 available in india now color available red silver and black delonghi dedica price r 28 000 including gst and home delievery call delonghi india contact 91 9899332022,i wonder if the new german wmf espresso lumero also in their special own brand stainless steel model is in effect licenced from the original delonghi the look amp specification are very similar price not wmf about 183 euro amp delonghi around 200eur in western europe,i wish she wa my mom,i subscribed just because how cool she is haha i love the vibe she is giving,hahahah funny way of starting,hello i am totally new in the espresso making and i have a very limited budget i wa thinking on buying an used machine of this model but i have an essential question maybe someone can help me which is the most suitable and affordable grinder for this machine d,love how she presented it,witch grind to you use,i have this coffee machine it really for newbie who want to have imitation of decent espresso or latte cappuccino you gon na ask why so portafilter with this little hole in it it not producing crema a it should be it just a trick crema disappears quickly a it not created by water steam pressure going through coffee but through this tiny hole in portafilter the steam wand doe not allow to produce decent steamed milk with correct texture it also created for people who do not have experience technique to foam milk so it extremely hard to do any latte art tamper also ha to be replaced summarizing if you want this machine because of the design it really nice though to make your espresso better you have to buy naked portafilter it not so pricy on aliexpress good grinder that allows to grind finer than those market grinder for 40dollar or you can disassemble it change grinding to finder and usable again it not perfect solution a those grinder produce a lot of coffee dust which make coffee more sour there is not much you can do about the steam wand if you do not want to loose warranty i would recommend to replace it with classic one in general if you want just design and so called espresso it ok,airplane you so crazy,that first line got me a,this lady is so great,i sick look at her better sleep at home,this woman is the best,are you going to do a review on the de longhi distinta coffee machine i quite fancy the dedica deluxe at this stage,lady is great funny and nice presentation,i removed the plastic and sawed off the bottom to make a bottomless portafilter trust me the espresso get between the plastic and the metal and when you unscrew that is portion to remove the plastic you will be very glad that you removed the plastic,can you make an americano using this machine,is the plastic inside the basket safe for long term use i believe the plastic metls over a period and cause all kind of health issue including cancer an deformity is it removable,can someone help me is it worth the money is their a better machine in the same price range do you recomend buying it,delonghi make nice tamper for this at least it is sold in europe,just discovered this channel this lady is amazing your character expertise and clarity are refreshingly rare never stop,same here,great review from a tell it like it is likeable believable person thanks want to comment that i just bought the dedica ec680 which is compared with this newer ec685 it is indicated that there are two major difference but i have only found one major one and one minor one yes the steam nozzle on the newer one ha two setting which is the major change but the drip tray on both model actually come apart not just the ec685 so you can use taller glass in both i call it a minor change however because there is no metallic removable secondary drip tray in the ec680 when you take the drip tray unit apart but if you do not want need flat hot milk then buying the ec680 is a much better deal a the unit are otherwise indistinguishable in how they function and a deal breaker for some inability to use a taller glass is actually possible in the older machine,gale you are amazing thank you dear for this great presentation,best ever video,great job could listen all day thanks,hello i still have the pressurized basket and i use the graef grinder do you have any idea why i get bitter and burnt coffee,could be your grinder i have seen other folk complain about this when you are grinder is burr get too hot then it mess up the bean it give them a sour burnt taste,is this the ec685 w thank you dedica,good job,plastic on the hottest spot not ideal,just for fun you know,love the way you talk greeting from egypt,you did not froth the milk properly you did not taste the espresso shot to see if they are extracted properly and you do not know how to pour milk all your video are like that i like to see review from true barista is,i bought it and have no regret i am saving more money here in the long run than buying coffee in cafe since it is lockdown i have great craving for coffee that this machine have met,zanke tanti,i do not even need to buy an espresso machine i am watching this video for gail,although it make nice coffee and milk it ha few problem if you have to make 2 capputsino then you have to make the first one then turn the machine off and then turn it on and make the 2nd one mine broke down within a year delonghi took it back and repaired it they didnt replace it with new yesterday it broke down again i am very happy about the quality of coffee it make especially if you know how to use it but very unhappy it broke twice,hello just bought my coffee machine coffee grinder and now i have to both set the coffee grinder and the espresso shot i have been reviewing your and some other video in regard to this topic separately but never at the same time a both set ups are interconnected how should i proceed if i set the coffee machine without coffee in it to a specific amount of espresso shot when i add my bean it might be le due to water absorbance then for setting up my grinding i need to control the flow for x milliliter of final coffee in the cup so how would you recommend me to set everything up thank you,that airplane part wa beautifully random lol,ok it look like she is too kind to tell that this machine is rubbish,a lovely video thanks i got given one of these new i find the coffee it doe is insipid,is the grinder included with the coffee machine thanx,no you have to purchase one and my advice for grinder you have to get a better one it is really effect the taste of espresso shot,why it produce so poor crema,maybe it is not a fresh bean and she use a pressurized basket i am using this machine with naked portafilter and non pressurized basket it is give me a good result,in the video the machine sounded very quiet is that how you would describe it thanks for any information,hmmm i ordered one of amazon uk and it arrived today and the milk thingy doe not work looking at it the pump doe not run when i turn the steam thingy question the long rubber bit under the metal that you removed is that required for it to work it would appear it is missing on mine so i wa going to contact amazon or whoever about that,little bit of somethin something nothing lol,great machine bought on the basis of this vid,did not know mine wa the deluxe version lol,just like my smeg one look the same,you are right my daughter ha the smeg and it look almost the same with the same button and functionality the smeg is over dollar200 more for basically the same machine,i really enjoy your review made lot of decision to purchase because of your great review short and to the point fact,good afternoon please tell me how to achieve a good foam of coffee,did you mean a crema,hahah she is funny xd,i got aluminum poisoning i do not use deodorant with aluminum my cookware

with this machine use it for a while and then get a better one,is the porta aluminum metal safe for food purpose because sometimes people tend to remove the plastic part and using non pressurize basket so the coffee get direct contact with the metal,if someone ha knowledge about this please share with u,i do not drink coffee my family doe so i can make it for the however the main reason i am looking at this machine is that when i used to make coffee for a living i also used to make really awesome hot chocolate with the frothy steamed milk and this machine is nice and thin which is great in my limited space it more importantly look to make great frothy milk and only heat required amount of water needed for single use at a time i could also make a cuppa tea with it which is awesome given it is my main drink,instant thumb up for this lady plane humour,coffee is acidic that is why it is not a good idea to have hot coffee pouring into plastic and then into your stomach,gail is review change how i think about thing,what is the size of the filter holder,the airplane bit is so goofy love it,i wan na be her friend,coffee newbe here doe making coffee out of these taste good like a starbucks latte,with a decent grinder and good bean it will taste way better than anything you can get at starbucks,is this product also called dedica style ec685 w,just bought the machine the frothing is a bit disappointimg but maybe i am not doing it right,w is a white wersion of the same coffee maker,love you gail,i just ordered mine i am so excited i can not contain myself,stealtho peep who care that you do not care,bruh who care,napz999 i have had mine for a year and it is still going i like it,it ha been 6 month since u ordered how is it are you still happy that you ordered or it wa le than what you expected im about to get one tomorrow i hope you will respond soon or any one else who had this machine thank you,how do you like it,we call that suicide of cappucino,a little bit of something something nothing i died lol,hey gail love your review how about do a few combination coffee espresso machine review,dang she is expert,you are a cool person,i bought a new ec685 in january 2019 i had one older that i bought 3 year ago but the pump gave up 3 year wa ok a i usually make 7 double shot a day i think the best advantage with my new one not shown in this video are the coffee filter now made up of 2 part the perforated filter that can be removed from the part with the one small hole for pressurizing this make it easier to check clogging in the perforated filter and the other part just hold up the part to a light window and you will observe any clogging use a needle a described in the manual to avoid clogging i also place a small round piece of filter paper that i cut out from normal melitta filter to perfectly fit the bottom of the perforated part one melitta filter give me 14 small piece and i cut 4 filter at the same time which is pretty fast and i now have 56 piece to further avoid clogging i weekly clean the filter by putting a 1 3 tsp of baking soda in the filter basket and run 2 3 water shot and then rinse the part a mentioned this is pressurized system but it would be very easy to make it a non pressurized system just drilling the one small hole to open it further i will try on the 1 shot filter to see how it work,so did you try to depressurize it,why do you make coffee the wrong way round is it an american thing,jacques du plessis i think it mix better this way also,hi what microphone set up do you use for your camera please,i wa buy this little machine super i recommend,i not disaster,why do not you make review about delonnghi 3351,thanks for posting it great video i am setting up a bike caffe a small business where i will serve espresso on wheel do you think i could use that gear dedica in that business thanks,for what a stranger on the internet opinion worth you would struggle to pull it off due to the temperature fluctuation between steam wand and espresso with this machine due it single boiler you will have inconsistent shot if selling latte and cappuccino and if you plan on making any quantity of espresso the water will be quick to overheat and it wont be so great the pressurised portafilter while convenient will not give you the kind of shot that a dedicated grinder fresh bean and correct grind size and extraction will you will be far more suited to aim for something in the prosumer market instead with a dual boiler coupled with a good quality grinder use the rancillio rocky a a point of reference if you any question i am happy to help just pop me an email at elevatecoffeetraining gmail com the world always need more coffee cheer,not bad but it cold hahahaha i do not like to drink cold coffee at all and i have tried delonghi machine it not giving hot coffee,scg ha such helpful video and always spot on i would like to know how many ounce of milk they pour and more milk foam froth detail maybe there is a video on that,love this channel i got a used ec155 about 6 month ago after discovering this channel have not used the deluxe but i would be willing to say that this machine is not worth the price difference of a 155 if you are just getting into espresso and wan na try out a cheap machine you can easily find a used ec155 for about dollar40 on ebay and clean mod it just a bit for about the same quality of drink at dollar350 i would probably save up a bit more for a breville just seems a bit more cost efficient,plastic in critical part shame i do not mind plastic body but plastic in steam line is bad,just bought this for dollar220 and it came with a free grinder best purchase ever,not sure about the machine but i love the presenter,thankyou so much for this review i will run to the nearest store to get this delongi coffee machine,or maybe you can buy it from the company that just spent time and money on a sale pitch,great vid cheer,helpful thx,nice reviewer sold,i regret why i bought nespresso citiz and saw this video,i blew mine up trying to get too much flavour out of each coffee packed the basket too tight machine deceased your relationship with the milk wand is more amicable than mine wa you present very well maybe a career in this field,i already have the dedica 680 amp love it i do not see anything that would cause me to covet the deluxe,i have the same one and i had try many different coffee and i can not get the coffee to make foam,i have just purchased delonghi ec 685 and right start from the first use it is not delivering hot water or steam i do not know what o have to do with brand new dedica,gale you are amazing never seen this channel and i do not even drink coffee but i subbed p,so i bought the ec680 2 month ago i took off the pressurized basket and bought a non pressurized one all i had to do wa remove the plastic piece inside the portafilter trim it down a bit put it back in place and inserted the non pressurized basket it work like a charm with that i bought a capresso grinder which manages to just about doe good grind for an espresso shot i put in 17g dose in the basket take about 25sec for about 34g yield espresso this is the biggest upgrade you do not need to change this machine if you do this upgrade a i get amazing shot there is such a massive difference in taste a well a the experience,harin dharmanandan what ground coffee do u use,what setting do you use on the capresso,hi guy fun review loved it i went and bought the dedica after seeing the review i like it so far but the amount of coffee it give is tiny i know it is espresso but come on you say in the video that the button are programmable but i think it is only for temperature and water hardness can the amount of coffee be programmed i have to press twice on the middle button to fill my cup thank you great channel,if you hold the button either one or two cup the coffee wil flow until you release it this volume will be saved by the machine and all your following shot will be the same volume,great review thank you,i like your energy very informative vid thanks,is it just me because i bought a machine on the european market or is delonghi a little off the standard the single cup button give me 50ml 1 7 oz and the double cup button give me 100ml 3 4 oz should not it be 30ml and 60ml 1 and 2 oz i know i can reprogram the button but how it is done seems pretty inaccurate to me,i found the same thing though it doe depend on coffee grind size and like others i find grinding for this machine deeply frustrating you can of course change the volume delivered by pressing and holding the 1 or 2 cup button until you get the desired amount then releasing the button to program it,i had one of these machine from about 14 month ago that had all these feature the boiler split and delonghi replaced it instead of repairing the new one i got is garbage the old one while loud made great shot with perfect crema i am a car guy not coffee but now it pours bugger all crema and leaf two gaping big black spot in the middle of the cup the basket come with a removable bottom now,,you are a delight a a reviewer lot of info and good showing continued success gail,0 50,honestly i just love gail haha she make me crack up and i watch video after video because she is just so great on camera keep it up,i have one it is great for home thanks for the review,mohammed al shuaili how is it holding up,this wa a treat to watch even though i am a 19 year old male i can not put my finger on it,is there any kind of water filter softener to place in the water tank for this machine,the manual read that there is one you can buy from delonghi there is a spot for it in the tank,do not think so i just use mineral water a i live in an area with very hard water the descaling alarm is basically just a counter that trigger after a certain number of us i think i pretty much ignore it now,can this machine make thicker coffee than this how do the barista in the cafe get the really thick coffee,fantastic thanks for the review,wa gon na ask wtf happened to your eye,i mean 5 17,5 23 that is what she said,i suspect the deluxe branding is just the term for the ec685 whereas the previous model wa the ec680 happy to stand corrected but i can not see any use of wouldeluxe in online store here in europe just ec685 with a suffix depending on colour m for metal bk for black r for red there is also a white version a demonstrated here but is often sold at a premium,this is true i just ordered the ec685 m and it ha all the new feature this wouldeluxe ha,i have the regulat dedica machine i do descaling on it twice a year changed the portafilter every year because it clog and it doe not matter whar type of coffee i use it will not have much brown froth foam do not matter if i tamp it little or too much sometimes the coffee drip instead of flow also feel like the machine is really trying a double shot barely count a a single show in volume i do not really like this machine bought a breville machine for my mom that cost twice a much sooo much better,what step on a rocky grinder would you suggest for it to come out smooth and not bitter,i have the standard machine and honestly there is very little difference having lived with one for a couple of year are there any downside the basket are impossible to clean and if they get clagged up totally knackered you can however get replacement basket on amazon with the bottom tray removable so you can clean them otherwise it is a pretty decent machine,hi gail i just bought my delonghi deluxe and rocky grinder but i still can not find the siting to make a good espresso do you have any recommendation,jen neuman yes do not grind very fine when using a pressurised basket use slightly coarser ground and you will get nicer espresso,i am using it in my coffee shop and it is amazing small and easy to use good choice for newbie,how is it doing now did you ever get a chance to have multiple customer waiting in line how long do you have to wait per shot,purchased the dedica a week ago and smashed through coffee that weekend love the machine great size which fit well on my kitchen work surface really easy to use and the espresso produced is fantastic make quick frothy milk ideal for flat white art bought my machine for gbp140 00 i have replaced the plastic tamper though useable is not ideal,where did you find it at that price,hi my sunbeam em5600 is getting a bit old and looking for a replacement how would you compare the dedica to the breville bes840,how much doe it cost in dollar,3,wow what a cool woman you are,5 19 that is what she said,hi dear i really like all your video including your fantastic humor thanks a lot,that lady is a great presenter,2 year later still such an awesome presenter,love gail,agree,death metal nah make her even cooler tbh,can i keep it switched on because of it automatic sleep mode because the power switch doe not seem to be the best at all love that machine good coffee for low price,still can not figure out where is the air intake of the panarello steam wand wish they upgrade the wand to those standard frothing wand instead of that standard panarello wand,i got a new delonghi machine ecp 35 31 it us the same filter basket of dedica but every time i brew an espresso i end up with a dirty brew head is that normal,hi gail do you know any good espresso machine that ha no plastic in the portafilter,for the hot milk mode doe it act like a traditional wand can i create decent microfoam with the hot milk mode on the steam wand,tina misu wang yes you can,tina misu wang no it just heat the milk with no foam,we have such machine at work and ok it is ok but when i have enough money to spare i am going for pided silvia and some grinder bottomless portafilter etc,i have old dedica and i would change it only for the colour i just love the look of white version mine is black and that is all i can not see any reason to buy it other than that so if you are person that do not have it yet just buy standard non deluxe version it is cheaper and i think that they already have even white color black metal red and white right now and i had to choose between black and metal when i wa buying it about machine itself it is really great of course it will not make perfectly foamed milk but still make decent one and i am sure it can do better with steam wand modification,i just got my standard one in black but am considering spray painting it the only downside is that i will void my warranty,huh 51mm tamper are quite common i picked up one on amazon for gbp10 the same price i paid for my delonghi bco410 on ebay,joe o sullivan aliexpress also ha 51mm tamper for anyone interested,gayle i love listening to you speak very american and funny,what is the most appropriate standard grinding coffee for this machine,fine grind,oh gail ha ha ha,can this be used for business or just for home,strictly for home use for business use you will need a high end espresso machine which usually cost a few thousand,thanks for the great video review gail almost returned this unit until i saw your video and learned what i wa doing that wa wrong,how many mm is the tamper for the dedica,51 mm,absolutely love the styling of this machine just wish they had an option that looked the same but offered higher end feature such a 58mm porta filter and steam wand rather than panarella add in some programability and you would have a winner,she is such a sweet heart,you mean he hehe,i got the exact same machine but it can not seem to extract fine grind grinder is the breville smart grinder pro i barely apply any pressure to even out the ground when temping it only drip with barely any coffee coming out in 10 second espresso taste sour help,go coarser with your grind the breville say a certain range is espresso but that is just a guideline also with the pressurized basket be very careful with fine grind there is only one hole on the bottom of many style of pressurized basket and it can be easily clogged with fine coffee grind soak your basket overnight in very hot water with cafiza powder dissolved and try brewing with the grind set to a notch or two coarser than you are using now,cornyroll i had te same problem i could not make double espresso i took it to service but delonghi said i put too much coffee two of their cup is too much for double basket idiot after that i complained to shop where i bought it and they managed with importer to give me new one this one work ok if i put much coffee and tamp hard it will choke but the old one choked with le coffee and no tamping so my conclusion is take it back where you bought it it is broken,i changed the wand on mind the standard one are terrible,do not take the plastic out of the portafilter you will have a great big screw holding the bottom,4 25,nice,gail is the best,do not forget to check her highly acclaimed video on latte design,i have had the dedica standard version for over a year now just some pointer 1 the plastic part in the portafilter doe not come out a far a im aware 2 the cup warmer ontop of the machine is non exsistent the temperature is hardly any different to the cold temperature of the bench it sits on 3 the milk steamer need to be cleaned after every use a the milk get stuck inbetween all those part the rubber and metal etc you can not just blow it out with hot steam 4 it look like they have improved the milk steamer with more frothy milk which is good 5 overall it a good little machine and im very happy with it and thouroughly recommend it to anyone it is the best in it price range when i bought it over a year ago,allison pell so do i,there is a screw on the portafilter by the nozzle that allows you to take the plastic part out agree on it being a great little machine i would not live without mine now,dedica come with pre brew or you can program it thanks,look like that frother would fit the older model a well wonder if they sell it separately,i would not rush out and buy the upgraded machine i have the original and it is not drastically different tamper you can get one amazon for around five pound 51mm otherwise it pretty much do is what it say and it make a pretty decent cup of coffee for the money only thing i would add is you a cup or something for when you put the steamer on a you get a squirt of water before it start to steam,bought my son the dedica for christmas we really enjoy the taste speed and simplicity of this unit always a pleasure to watch your entertaining review thank you,look identical to smeg is machine maybe even the exact same machine that is just branded differently are smeg and delonghi somehow related,smeg wa second delonghi made it first so smeg ripped off design it is 100percent the same machine with just changed outside design,i have the smeg seems to be the same internals with a different coat best machine i have had,i want the gaggia classic i did not realize your a store,hi gail great review i have this machine but my coffee come out tasting very watery what am i doing wrong could it be something with the water teperature keep up the good work cheer from sweden,final bos have you tried a finer grind setting with your grinder i have a different machine but i have to dial in the right fineness with my grinder for each different type of bean i use the store grinder absolutely doe not work with my machine,hi there did you manage to make better coffee cause i have just bought this machine with the delonghi kg521 grinder a few day ago and to be honest i am not really that satisfied with the shot i pull they do not really have a body i know it is a pressurized basket so i am ordering another basket and maybe a second portafilter a well to make bottomless to do a non pressurized basket mod maybe that will make thing better compared to my capsule machine before krups dolce gusto it is not that better anyway if you by any chance got some tip that helped you grind size tamping whatever i would like to hear them,i got this machine and wa really disappointed in it espresso wa not hot enough flavor wa just ok i switched to breville infuser and love it so hot amazing crema and flavor,can anyone recommend a nice grinder that is dollar100,badnercalabrese the gvx212 it is only dollar46 in the u any opinion on the gvx1 it is about dollar10 more these are burr machine right,how much,what you get is a lot of plastic for your money with a pressurized portafilter you do not make espresso just coffee,what aeroplane have you been on,what is the difference between the dedica style and the deluxe,i just do not understand why delonghi doe not use standard 58mm porta filter 51mm is really odd can not get any accessory with this size,well i am using a la pavoni and we are also using 51 49mm portafilters 58mm are usually for higher end commercial machine,surprised i do not have trouble finding accessory but you are right why do not they all stick to 58mm and provide a portafilter to hold a standard volume of ground,but have they cured the leaking problem i had to return 3 unit straight away because of massive leak from underneath we changed to a different model which is fine we are not alone,the manual mention that an excess of water under the tank would be normal and should be dried up when needed,my standard version dedica literally arrived within hour of this video can not wait to test it btw thanks gail another great video,luciano mieldazis did you test what about espresso in this machine,best budget grinder for dedica pressurized basket,the gvx212 is dollar46 u any idea if the gvx1 14 is any better or the difference,50 60euros,domo delonghi krups severin sencor russel hobbs have same internals difference is in the motor chasis and price i wa looking at capresso infinity called in my country nivona cafegrando cost about 80 90euros but mby there is something better then that,thats 300euros for grinder and ec685m cost me 180euros im looking for something cheaper about 1 2 price of machine friend owns graef cm 800 and it grind too fine for pressurized portafilter and cost around 150euros,how about feima 600n or 610n it is taiwanese but not bad for it price,i first watched the video on my phone and i wa shocked i wa like what is wrong with your eye gail now that i am on my laptop i can see you have the basket on whew thanks for explaining the difference between pressurized and unpressurized basket i hope you and the crew had a great holiday break happy new year,1 thing that seems to hard to pinpoint is the grind size the pressurized filter doe not allow espresso sized grind you need to go a little bigger that is why dedica grinder is a must buy,badnercalabrese that is my exact setup it work well enough for what i need,i set my grind size about half way between fine and medium any smaller it clog up any coarser and it is weak if i buy ready ground coffee from the supermarket i run it through the burr grinder to take it down a big finer and you get a much better coffee,i heard de longhi say extraction time for these machine is 18 21 second so i assume just adjust your grind setting to get that extraction time,i have a delonghi with that type of portafilter when i go to tap out the ground the little filter always come out any idea why i end up having to poke the ground out with a spoon in order to not fish the filter out of the trash,haha i got ta tip do not knock it out on the sink snap your wrist in the air above the bin without knocking it on anything it will come right out,wow so i am not crazy at least not about this i do let it cool sometimes i accidentally leave the ground in there until i make another cup,cool down the basket for a while 30 or le and u will be fine,activediabetic because these type of machine doe not have three way selonid valve after brewing a coffee there is no sucking the wetness out of the puck that is why is doe not work by knocking out the puck,dollar100 more expensive than previous version not much upgrade to justify that better to go for breville duo temp pro instead of this or capresso ec pro,same in sweden just bought the 685 for 150 euro my old 680 wa 200 euro 3 or 4 year ago the pump stopped working on the old one but i still decided to by the 685 a i wa very satisfied with the coffee it made,in my country it cost the same if not even cheaper than 680,just bought the ec685 for 144 euro that is dollar166 can not really complain about the price even filter coffee machine like moccamaster cost more,i got a 51mm calibrated tamper on amazon for 21 buck so far it is my favorite thing from amazon,score,jason whitton tamper in china can be bought for dollar5 or le,the dedica is a fantastic machine so simple yet so capable and a packed with so many feature for the price the first thing i did wa remove the panarello frothing nozel and just used the rubber nozel underneath with a bit of technique and a small milk pitcher you can create surprisingly good milk to make latte art some may even call it microfoam also if you remove the plastic bit in the porter filter you can actually fit a 51mm non pressurised basket found one on amazon called magideal coffee 2 cup 51mm only 4 quid and work a treat,tina misu wang if i understood well the rubber part the nozzle for froth if this is it then the problem is simple you must wash off the nozzle disconnecting it from the metal outer part if there is a i do not know this maschine in particular once milk get hard there it block the way for new milk the pressure push the rubbef down,hey scott i just got this machine and i am wondering what is the best grind setting on my delonghi burr grinder all the way to fine,utsav soni if i got you right you mean two different coffee brand if so it is normal the need to adjust the dose and grind to achieve comparable yield you can try and revert with the result and yes if there is no output from the espresso machine you can melt the pump i would stop once there ha been 10 15 sec with no output,hello scott is it possible to change the steam wand tip to change it for a 2 hole 4 hole tip thanks for the insight,scarface4u2 hey so i bought the machine and it working really well i have a question to run by you i used two coffee with the same espresso grind and using the same pressure to pack it then why doe one pour a good 60 ml shot and the other one hardly 10 ml i am not complaining about the taste but will the one taking longer time to extract damage the machine kindly enlighten me,hey guy big fan i wa wondering which one of the following would you believe make a better cup o coffee siphon chemex v60 aeropress french press,kalita wave or siphon if you want to spend the money,aeropress and french press are awesome,de gustibus non est disputandum in matter of taste there can be no dispute it is a matter of personal preference some like the way french press produce the body some like it better with siphon but to me i like how aeropress creates the body it feel bolder and with metal filter it taste richer than paper filter but when i want a thinner body or le stronger taste i felt pour over can delivers i think it come down on how the contraption work pour over have some what le contact with the grind a the water pass through and for the press well it press the grind and this extract the grind to some extent of course the bean quality the roasting grind size water quality temperature etc and many other thing that can change the end result to which eventually come down to de gustibus d,i have this machine and i have to correct you on one thing it actually allows me to make latte art i would recommend it to people who just got into coffee and brewing to learn more about it i will definitely upgrade to a better machine that allows non pressurised brewing but until then i will keep enjoying this machine,you can use non pressurised basket with this machine a well i agree with you about upgrading to a real espresso machine which is capable of producing good crema do not forget to buy a good grinder,u drawn a baby dinosaur,the original version look much better in my opinion i can only hope that the painted surface are metal and not plastic the original also ha a removable tray to fit tall cup though without the metal drip tray on the very bottom so the only worthwhile new feature is the dual mode panarello i have the original version work very well and make great coffee without taking up too much space on the counter,i just ordered the ec685 it come in different color i chose the metal design,i wa hoping to upgrade my old dedica for this machine expecting it would come with unpressurized basket and non penarello steam wand guess i will stick to my old one with self upgraded non pressurized basket and naked portafilter,you can order 51mm non pressurized basket from ebay cheap but they take a while,nice

4,what feature do you look for in an espresso machine,doe it still work fine,micah robert you want to get a machine that ha 2 boiler so the water and steam are heated seperately but they are quite a bit more expensive,non pressurized basket standard no fancy steaming wand is enough for me,one that is able to steam without overheating that quickly,good froth love cappuccino,came here because i like the machine but that milk wand is a bear the fat wand just aerates too much and it overflow the pitcher anyone else have this problem or know how to resolve it,i have found that you can unscrew the fat part of the wand and it is a much smaller silicone one underneath it is not a good a replacing it with a metal one but it is an easy thing to try,hello what are size of your cup when you brewed for 2 cup my cup are 5 oz will it work for them,hi i have the model ec685 and i use the double shot until where should i fill it,it is an excellent premium coffee machine for a family,great tute,when i grind coffe bean to nearly a powder this machine can not handle it also i am struggling with amount of coffee that go to cup seems like it is not enough even for one espresso when using double espresso button can anyone help me with that otherwise i will have to return that machine,thanks for the review unfortunetly i really wanted to hear how loud it wa but you played music over the actual coffee making part,jj shankles thanks so much for that info,sorry about that i just measured it with an app and the brew cycle wa between 50 52 db which is below a normal conversation steaming milk wa a bit louder between 65 70 db i can easily carry a conversation during the brew cycle i think my grinder is louder than the brew cycle,hi i had an updated version of this coffee machine for christmas i love it been using illy coffee in it thank you for the video can you change the temp of coffee,i am not sure i have not messed with changing the setting but i think it might have some adjustability of some setting,just got this machine for christmas and so far so good it made great espresso i am still learning the cream method hope to save drive through money ha,you need to speak more succinctly just get to the point,i can not get the coffee holder part to go in how do i do that,doe it come with the cup will a mug fit underneath,jj shankles i have read some bad review is there another you recommend in the same price range tired of returning them lol,it did not come with the cup but i just move the drip tray and a mug will fit when i want an americano or latte,where did you get your espresso cup and what type of coffee bean do you recommend thanks,the machine keep on blinking after you make a coffee how do you make another coffee after that do you need to restart the machine every time i am struggling to make multiple cup of coffee one after another,difference against ec785,the ec785 ha what they call a more advanced milk wand i do not think it would be worth paying more for,aah thank you for this tutorial it helped especially when using the steam,thank you i am so glad it helped,i followed what you did step by step with the same basket and choosing the same double shot button but it only dispensed 1 5 to 1 6 of the same cup you have do you know what could be the problem,this could happen if you are grinding too fine or you are tamping too hard to make sure the machine is working fine you could just run it with no coffee in it to make sure it dispenses the correct amount of water through a cycle,would i need to buy a grinder to use with this,it need finely ground coffee so if you get espresso ground coffee then it should work,iv got this machine but my nozzle is the one ur talking about with it been longer and it is really good must be an update one maybe,m j yes it is the one with longer nozzle yeah i will continue to look at the video i already got it to make le noise practice make perfect,is ur one the long nozzle mate mine is and i got it working good and milk is sweet type it into youtube and there is a couple of video to get ur head around it that is what i done and i make them so good now,yeah i got mine also today but i am struggling so much it is got a different nozzle from video but otherwise exactly the same it is making so much noise i am afraid my neighbour is going to start to complain i must be doing something seriously wrong i will try again tomorrow,th nks jj i like your easy to understand presentation,you are welcome,thanks for this brother,i am glad you enjoyed it,in order to get more foam you should try aerating the milk first for about 4 ish second so basically you keep the stream almost at the top of the milk and you hear this sound almost like paper ripping and after you put the nozzle all the way in to finish foaming the milk for a cappuccino you can aerate the milk for about 7 10 second which will produce much more foam a cappuccino is mainly foam and a little bit of milk but thanks for the review of the machine,thank you for that tip i have felt like my foam game could use some improvement,got this new machine this week pulled out a double shot perfectly but the milk steamer is not working a expected when i use it it work for like 2 3 second and then it go off and the single and double coffee light blink what am i doing wrong here,it is a constant blink or blinking 3 time then a pause the constant blink mean it is not hot enough just let it wait for a minute before trying again,hows it working now i have heard these go to shit after several month,i still use it usually more than once a day and it still make great espresso,look good i have the lavazza mini and it is working great but this machine may not last too long so i think this delonghi maybe my next machine,this delonghi is still working great over two year of use,great review what is your preferred ratio for the single and double shot,mine ha had really mixed result sometimes good like the one you are making sometimes cold or weak the coffee only come out of one of the two exit wodering if it might be faulty any thought,it could be too fine of a grind on the coffee bean or tamping too hard you could take the stump apart to make sure nothing is blocking one of the exit if the brew is taking over 20 second from first flow to finish then it is probably too fine a grind or over tamping,great vid what grinder do you use thanks,i have that exact capresso grinder it seems to have quite a bit of retention any suggestion to make it better,what do you mean retention mine ha been going good for a few year now,cool review thanks,i am italian please learn how to pronounce the name of the manufacturer of the appliance that you present,you have the same voice a jakenbakelive,you totally waited too long to pull your steam instead of resetting the machine you can pull hot water to come down from steam temp to brewing temp that is what happened smooth play off though someone who doe not drink 6 cup a day for the past 5 year form this machine will not notice a thing,very observant yeah it wa just an issue of adjusting thing for filming usually doe not take a long when i am not trying to record at the same time,i can not seem to attach the filter into the insert to put in espresso is there a trick or how to line it up,4 03 pitcher ok man i quit,hahaha,you make putting the coffee holder in so simple i am having trouble getting mine in how do you do this,nick bavea it might be that you have too much coffee in the tamper he showed help to level thing and ensure you do not have too little or too much,i have the same machine and in mine the group i think it is called take a lot of effort to properly lock in place is that normal,do not press too hard,great review,whole heartedly agree with this except when he said that the milk frother is not very customisable and give you the same foam every time is not true i have been experimenting after watching multiple video and im now quite able to make very frothy steamed milk while also being able to make a small amount of foam but steam the milk nicely think of the difference between a latte and a cappuccino also the machine did not overheat although someone already addressed that,i got same machine for about a year now work nice and make great espresso,so much faff i will pas,tr s int ressant merci,great review thanks,doe it collect fingerprint on the front plastic i mean it color seems to be susceptible to that,can it make americano,goattoaster thank you also wondering what the brew temperature is,yes just brew the espresso in a mug then add water,i have found if you move the milk jug up and down it a you rotate it it doe make more foam xx,can you make tea with this,you could use the nozzle to boil water into a cup with a tea bag in it,delonghi is machine is very good i use magnifica s and it taste too good and i drink too much coffee the video wa very helpful with love from japan,i tried reverse order i first frothed the milk and then when i switched to espresso the light keep flashing i then have to turn off and then turn back on and then the button are no longer flashing i will go back to first making espresso before frothing the milk but i wa just curious if anyone else ha had this problem,after frothing the milk you can not make espresso immediately if the 2 espresso button are flashing a it indicates that the boiler is too hot and the machine will not let you to prevent burning the coffee all you need to you is to turn the steam dial and let it cool down you will know it is ready when it is no longer ejecting water,gross dude you do not let espresso sit like that steam the milk first and add the shot asap when it turning black like that it mean the shot ha gotten bitter,this is so true usually it doe not sit around like that just when filming the video it had to sit around so i could film it,how do i fix it when it seems like the pump is not pumping well it ha been completely cleaned it seems like all home espresso machine work for 2 3 year then have pump problem,in this video you are cup are quite full do you push the brew button more than once i have got the same machine and find that it doe not brew much in fact the two cup button brew le than the single it doe not make sense,you can preprogram each setting by holding the button for a long a u want the water to flow so u can end up having more water in one shot mode than two,what is up with the black plastic in the steel holder they give you woudnt they burn if the hot coffee is coming through it,this review helped me decide on buying this machine over others how did you so easily swing lock that portafilter when i try to do it it feel like it get stuck towards the end and i have nearly toppled the machine over doing so any advice,your dose the amount of ground coffee in the portafilter is too much just reduce it until you can turn the portafilter properly,great video,do you know of a good similar model that come with a steam wand rather than a frother anymore steam wand are not professional a they are easy to learn in just a cup or two so you can make your own decision whether you want a latte or cappuccino and without overheating when you use it too damn this model just plain suck the ideal machine would be a company considerate enough to throw in a tamper with it is filter so you can use the thing out of the box,most company will give you a cheap plastic tamp just to get going i will probably go for the gaggia classic later but for now after my breville died in le than a year barely more than half a year i have just ordered a cheap as chinese machine it may well turn out to be unreliable rubbish but so wa my breville and the one i have ordered ha a real steam wand proper 58mm portafiler a pressure gauge and obvious rip off copied button like the breville range for a tiny fraction of the price it is called a gemilai crm3605 wish me luck,why the music i wanted to hear the noise level but instead got your music of choice i wa watching the video from the beginning and waiting to press that start button to hear how loud it is instead you played music frggin mozzart bro,how long doe it typically take to preheat the machine,jj shankles great thanks for the quick reply,i just tested and it took 40 second to preheat,bought this for myself and my husband for christmas should have watched the review first i will be taking it back,thanks dude got my wife one for christmas and your video had u making the perfect coffee in minute,he actually doe not do it quite properly,thanks i am so glad i wa able to help merry christmas,what a great tutorial i wa feeling overwhelmed with all of the tutorial until i found yours thank you,i just got one and yes it get some failure i used it in the morning and it wa good i used it like at 2 pm and i wa good i used for my mom at 5 and it wa good but i used like 7 30 or 8 pm and u could not get single nor double shot it just would not come out not it is not the first time so idk if i should give it back or what,can this make a regular americano too just plain coffee cause my grandparent are drinking only that but i drink only latte and cappuccino,why do not you pour the espresso directly into your glass mug seems like it would be easier to skip washing the espresso glass can the mug fit underneath,it wa just to film it brewing like that on a normal day i just brew it into the mug,can this make an americano,thanks,am i the first to notice your nice le creuset mug,you are the first to point it out i love how cute it is,great honest review look like something i would consider buying i consider it overheating very minor but great to actually see it in the review,the way you frioth the milk is so not the right way i have worked a a barista for 6 year,hey man great video thanks much respect,i want this machine,no satisfied with the demonstration of the steam,what is your grinder i have been looking for one like that,what grind setting do you use on your capresso looking into getting this machine and i have the capresso grinder already,goattoaster thanks so much since it is been over a year since you have posted this do you still recommend it,i grind it between fine and extra fine,this guy convinced me not to buy this machine,katsu it is not about the machine is more about his review xd,why is that i consider buying it,can you do art with this,i have tried but i am not good at it i am sure if you tried enough time or were good at it then this machine could make latte art,my machine will not make the espresso it overheated any suggestion,great review thanks,i bought one just know im so excited to try it i hope it be received early,how do you like it,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,steam wand is very small and the hot water splashing out make a real mess a well a whenever you wan na froth the milk you got ta remove the coffee filter holder which is kind of a drag,hi the tamper is 53mm thanks,51 mm,thank for the feedback,you had me at the gallon of milk smashing the pitcher on your counter super funny,we can not make this machine make dense coffee it always come out tea style i e present this machine to my mom but it just doe not work i hardly believe our coffee can come out like yours i played with water hardness temperature nothing help i should have returned it back in time to amazon,addk3 i had the same problem wa very frustrating no matter what i did the coffee came out bitter and watery so i started watching tutorial and finally fixed my problem now my espresso is perfect and better than anything i tasted before at any coffee shop now i did many thing such a buying proper grinder non pressurized filter proper coffee and the same tamper he us but before doing all of that i learned one technique that you can try right away and it might just work without all other thing i learned that there must be a space between coffee level and the top screen from where water come out i always thought that coffee should touch that screen and loaded the filter a such that wa a big mistake if you think that you may also load too much try loading le and compress harder test your load lock it into position and remove do you see any scratch on the coffee surface are there any coffee grind on the metal screen of the machine if yes then you are loading too much apparently it is important that water fill the empty space called headroom first and then start sipping through compression is very important press hard and make sure it is levelled watch some video how to press properly these two thing headroom and proper compression should make a big difference adding all other thing i mentioned will elevate it to all new level,doe it include the cup for the milk,no mine did not come bundled together i had to get it separately,we bought this about 18months ago and still love it,thank you goattoaster just bought this one and trying to figure it out never owned one before this wa very helpful can you recommend a coffee bean grinder that is not too expensive i see one on your counter there thanks,thank you for this review you lovely soul,mine doe not produce any crema i did read the manual adjust the temp setting primed the machine by releasing 100ml of water through the nozzle and made more than 5 attempt one of the worst coffee experience i ever had the coffee wa too hot bitter and had no crema whatsoever,freddy fufu make sure coffee doe not touch the top part of the machine where water come out and apply more compression there must be a space between coffee and the top screen called headroom up to 3 mm is recommended the level in his video is pretty good proper compression is also very important this should make a big difference,what the tamper size 49mm or 51mm thank you,it us a 51mm tamper,i just got my machine i am not sure is my mine have problem or is just how it is i weighted my milk after steam it will have 20g more after that i found out the steamer spay some water out while i steaming the milk is it normal or something wrong with my machine,goattoaster i let some water out before steam but still have some water let out,i am not sure exactly how much it let out but initially it doe let out a bit of water while clearing the steam pipe my method is to let the machine heat up for steam then release a little bit of steam into an empty glass first to clear out that water then you can use it a normal and it will not let out a much water into your milk hope that help,hi can i use capsule too,it doe work with pod like this but not the plastic nespresso pod i have not used these personally but delonghi say they work,i have this machine since december but not it doe not have enough pressure or something else is going on that is not pouring like when it wa new i have discale it 3 time and also i live in nyc and the water is good i am almost putting it in the garbage and get a breville,that is odd i have used mine for almost 2 year and it work great still are you using the same grind setting and pressure while tamping whenever tamp too hard or grind too fine it can struggle to get at good brew,oh my god you are a life saver i work s in a cafe and our coffee machine is broken and they bought me this delonghi coffee machine and i didnt know how to steam my milk now i get it the machine wa already used and doe not have the manual thank you2222,i am so glad you found it useful,very nice and professional review thanks,glad it wa helpful,mine is out of order i need a place to fix it any suggestion,sorry i do not have any recommendation i have not needed to get mine serviced delonghi ha an official list of service center on their website or you could probably look locally for somewhere that work on coffee machine,thanks btw,just got this the other day great tutorial,it look like a nice one but the review on it are not that great also you made a latte not a cappuccino not that there is much of a difference it is just the way your poured the milk in,lol yeah that wa definitely a latte,hi i have just bought one of these based off your video can i ask why your esspressos are so much larger than mine make ours make maybe 1 5 the amount that yours doe what are we doing wrong also how can we make an americano,ragnotzo try to measure it next time proper single shot espresso should be about 30 ml only and double is 60 this machine ha a special setting a well to change temperature of you shot and amount of coffee that give each time,jj shankles thanks for your reply in hindsight the americano question wa a bit daft wa not sure if there wa a particular setting for one one last question if i may i am getting very little crema in my esspresso shot i am using illy bean with the de longhi bladed grinder do you think the inconsistency of the bladed grinder is the problem or something else really appreciate your help,are you getting a good flow i have had that issue when i put too much ground coffee in or pack it too tight also for an americano i brew the espresso into a mug and top with hot water,my rotate to close made me want to throw the machine out the window,how is it holding up where did you get tamp i am hoping to get this machine soon,it still work perfectly after a year and a half i do have to clean it about every 6 month and the tamp i found on amazon i put a link in the description but any 51mm tamp should work,sadly amazon review indicate a recent high machine failure rate i went for the breville bambino plus a it recently had a dollar100 00 price drop,i have had the reverse my new shiny bambino died after only 7 month so now i am back to using the dedica again it is a pretty feeble machine but at least it still work unlike the breville,they should have incorporated an alarm to let u know when it is preheated do you know if the machine ha this option,it honestly doe not take long at all to preheat so there is no point in that feature,i wish it had that option i have not seen anything like that in the manual,how do you get it ready for first use the instruction in the manual are confusing,i own this machine but lost the scoop that wa included do you happen to know about how much espresso equal two scoop is it comparable to two tablespoon,i think around 12 14grams is about the right amount for the double espresso basket,lauren masaitis the scoop is not ideal for beeing used to get the right amount of bean a even if you try the amount of bean will vary a lot and you should not need it a since you have to fill the cup anyway better orientate with the fill size of the cup or use a scale,one scoop is about one rounded table spoon so two scoop is a little over two tablespoon,your machine stopped frothing at around 06 33 because by the time you actually turned the lever handle to the steam position the machine switched back to the espresso shot setting your timing of this wa perfect a you can see the single shot button light up a soon a you turn the handle to steam 06 23 for some reason the steam setting only stay on for a set amount of time before the machine switch back to the espresso shot presets i am sure there is a good reason for why the machine is programmed this way,it will be a heat thing the machine would rather disable the steam wand then just shoot subcritical water into your milk,lol you messed up the steamer demonstration there mate,great video love my machine but my one complaint is that the unit doe not get hot enough for the steamer the lack of heat will stop the steamer mid way so i usually pre warm the machine for 5 minute or so after i make my espresso,jcosk8 so what position for the steam should we push the knob further to the back sometimes i think knob position play a role in here but i do not know if it is true or not,jcosk8 i think that is what i saw him do i usually do a quick release of course when you do that some water is going to come out before the steam it is just purging a bit of the line anyway it is all good i love my machine and it ha not really been a big issue,anthony according to the manual you should position an empty container under the cappuccino maker and open the dial for a few second to eliminate any air left in the circuit close the dial again so you should not draw any water just make sure there is no air caught up in the tube this is very different from the instruction for cooling the machine to make coffee again to make coffee again immediately after frothing milk the boiler must first be cooled or the coffee will be burnt proceed a follows place a container under the cappuccino maker open the steam dial to deliver hot water and cool the boiler you only need to draw hot water when you want the temp to go down to coffee making level if you draw water before wanting to use steam you are basically cooling down the machine before you start it make no sense,jcosk8 i think he is doing it correctly he first draw it down to release some of the residual water that is how it is explained in the instruction manual a well i understand that if you continue to draw water it will cool down the boiler so that you can make espresso again i think he is right in that it is not the strongest heating element so you have to let it warm up for a few minute i also have my toaster plugged in to the same outlet i do not know if that make a difference,do you do it like him if so it is wrong the down position is to draw water and bring the temp down so you can brew coffee after steaming milk if you draw water and bring the heat down then it stop midway in the steaming if you do it correctly it should not stop you will actually have to cool it down to continue using it for coffee,hey man cool video and thanks for uploading i have this machine and am having trouble getting a nice flow through the espresso it start to flow after approx 5 second and then becomes a little temperamental am i doing something wrong i am using espresso ground coffee in the double shot filter i am also tamping down well,you may be tamping down too hard if it is having trouble getting a good flow the 5 second delay is usual for it to build pressure,how do you get 2 scoop to fit i used the scooper it came with and can not get 2 scoop to fit even putting a little le than a scoop i can not get it loaded because it is too tight,are you tamping hard enough to make a little puck i do not overflow the scoop and now i usually just pour in the stump because i know about how full to make it,i have the same delonghi dedica machine but i can not get a nice crema like yours what is the trick i have the default setting should i play with temp and time setting or is it my choice of coffee any tip would be appreciated thanks,jj shankles thanks i just ground a little more with a good strong tamping yes with 25 30 sec brew time default setting and i wa able to get a little crema out of it i think i am getting somewhere thanks for the tip,are you getting a good 20 25 second brew time i still have the temp set at the default adjusting how fine of a grind you use and how hard you tamp the grind will change the brew time hope this help some,your cute,super helpful thanks,i got aluminum poisoning i do not use deodorant with aluminum my cookware seems ok i use a water filter for drinking water i have this expresso machine and idk if maybe there is aluminum leaking from this porta filter doe anyone know if the porta filter is aluminum,thank you so much i think i am going to get this one great review,ndr shr yes i purchased it last year and i love it i definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a space efficient model,how do you like it,i just got mine and it wa really noisy and leak so wa waiting to hear the noise of the pump to compare it to a working one and,the build quality is very poor pop the top and you will find a bunch of plastic component waiting to fail mine did a couple of week after the warranty ran out,i bought the same machine but at first use the sump handle just got stuck while making coffee when i pressed the double cup button to make the double shot espresso just few drop came out and nothing at all i tried to remove the sump handle it just stuck and not moving at all,jj shankles thanks a lot for your reply you are absolutely right in my case since this is my first espresso machine i grind the coffee too fine which created pressure and water through coffee filter could not pas through well i left the machine for 6 hour but still took a little more force to release the handle the next shot wa much better a the coffee wa medium grind,i have had this issue when i pack the coffee ground too tight or grind the coffee to fine sometimes when the stump get stuck like that just leaving it for a minute to depressurize will make it easy to remove again hopefully that help,what coffee grinder do you use,jj shankles thanks i am curious if the cheaper but from what i have heard is still a good grinder called wilfa wscg 2 can grind the coffee fine enough for espresso what do you think,this one by capresso,de long e eeeeeeeeeeeeeee for the pronunciation nice review,great review i just bought one and this helped me understand how to use it,did not follow review and bought it anyway got a lemon had to return it bummed me out,you are so close to better espresso get an unpressurized filter this fit my delonghi get a real wand to to make legit latte art foam even with the cover taken off that wand it is not the same here is a replacement off a 700 dollar machine that fit our machine i have done these upgrade and it definitely help nothing but preground v fresh more helped change the espresso coming out that machine then these upgrade these are the main thing that separate this machine from a breville duo temp btw my man you got ta take that wand apart after every use for sure that is the value of the pro wand harder to use but faster and le cleanup there is bad milk all up in that wand trust me mine never lost temp like that either and a traditional cappuccino is 1 3 espresso 1 3 steamed milk 1 3 milk foam better wand and another filter is no more work,thank you for a great video i brought this machine today i agree with you about it edge over the breville espresso at similar price point very pleased with my purchase it a bargain at the end of the day i m just learning how to use the machine i am getting good result but a i learn it will get better,thanks for this i have the same espresso machine but mine just drip am i doing something wrong,goattoaster 9 that is probably it thanks,that can happen if you overpack the ground or if they are ground too fine or you could try putting a little le ground in,thank you now i know what i will purchase,for the double shot in this video what cup button did you select at the top,i pressed the middle double shot button,is this independent test or is that product placement thank you for answer i am asking just because everywhere i am collecting info about espresso machine i read that is better to have a coffee in the coffee house than buying anything like this because machine like this are not able to keep stable pressure 9 bar and temperature 90 c,jj shankles thank you for answer,i bought this machine myself and wa not paid to make a review i am also not a professional barista so i do not know the specific of bar or pressure i have just enjoyed using this machine and think it make good espresso so i made this review video,,you can remove the cover from the steam wand by twisting left and pulling off now you have a wand you can use like a pro,this i wa ging to ask thx,rakanwd or you could just let it be a it is and use it like a pro cause in the end it is just a steam wand pretty simple or even better just purchase a dedicated machine from severin that doe not need steam at all for perfect latte foam,rakanwd hello may i please ask you for more information which one is suitable for dedica thank you very much for your reply in advance,pro tip,what is the daily clean up like do you remove the portion cup and rinse then just rinse the cup with the handle,daily i will leave the cup in the handle and rinse it out about once a week or two i will pull the handle out and rinse them separately to give them a good clean,i have trouble in lining up the filter underneath the machine the filter doe not slot in easily,this happens to me when i put too much coffee in the filter try putting le ground in the cup,if i do not have a grinder and in order to get a good crema can i buy the illy ground coffee for this machine,the crema depends on the type of bean some bean have more characteristic that show a nice crema layer and some le,i have used illy and made some great espresso with this machine,i have been reading a lot of review about this particular machine and it seems people have issue with longevity a reoccurring problem with leak and failing pump ha anyone else had this issue is this machine going to last,sai peri hi i have had this machine for 5 year zero issue used 1 3 time per day i can say most issue with people that think they have a leak is that they filled the water reservoir up to far it will drip out the bottom pump ha been flawless any issue with flow had been i put to much in the filter,what setting on your grinder do you use i have the same one and i am thinking of buying this espresso machine,i use it between fine and extra fine that range work well for me,if i press the powder coffee a little too hard the coffee doe not come out,jj shankles but in the video you have pressed it pretty hard,i have had that happen i think it is because the machine can not build up enough pressure to brew when the ground are too tight,my favorite very stylish look,haha you fucked up the milk with water i use a thermometer and i stop at 60 degree since this appliance is weak you do not have to move the mug that much it is not a real machine it can not make latte art either with or without milk your espresso look disgusting there is no crema at all i have this appliance for two year now at first i wa very excited figuring i wa upgrading from stove espresso pot big change however after 2 month it started to piss me off the portafilter wa just dripping and the taste wa bitter watery and undrinkable breville appliance stand in the same category this quality level doe not offer any stability in heat or quality it is pressurized basket coffee not a real espresso machine it is a fake espresso it will never get a close a a great starbucks real espresso although it is a fair machine for a tight budget looking for a heat exchanger pid e61 group head the very best that is a real machine,get an unpressurized basket,just bought a dedica but a i tried to make the first real espresso today the machine worked with huge sound but then suddenly stopped after unboxing yesterday i already made four double shot any help on that thx,mine make a lot of loud rattling noise at the beginning before the espresso start coming out i put the whole machine on a dish towel and that help a little bit but it is normal to be loud at the start of the brew,what is your favourite coffee bean,goattoaster 9 k,my go to is lavazza super crema or gran crema or illy is also a really good brand,this video wa a big help it give important setup and operation tip,nice vid straight to the point no bullshit like these other video you sir get a like,thank you for the kind word it mean a lot,doe the machine stop when the coffee is ready automatically or do you have to stop it,the machine stop when the brew is done it also ha an auto turn off feature if you forget to power off the whole machine so it will not stay hot all day if you do not turn it off,got this a a gift and it is sat on the shelf for some time a i wa not sure how to use it thanks for helping out coffee is now a feature,so disappointing no art latte,i recently bought this machine and ive been having problem with the steam wand my process is choose steam button wait till it stop flashing purge but to do the next step the other 2 button start flashing a they did in your video a you said it probably mean it over heated but the problem is that the do not stop flashing no matter how long i wait one time just to test it i waited 10 min they never stopped flashing other time i can start the steam wand without waiting but then stop just like it did on your video but then take age to be able to use the wand again any suggestion i honestly do not understand what im doing wrong,to stop the flash turn on the knob again amd it will run the water let it be around 5 sec until the water stop flowing and the flash stop thata it yoir machine is ready again,after you use steam wand when the lihts flash mean it over heated you need to open to knob and let the water floow until it stop around 5sec and the light will stop to flash amd your machine is ready again,just picked this machine up do you have to let any steam out after making the espresso but before removing the handle ground holder,no after the espresso brew i just rotate the handle off,thank you,i am glad you liked it,i have had mine for over 2 year it is getting tired now i keep cleaning it out i run vinegar through it work well for a while then it is done i think the pump is going but it ha been a good machine,i will have to use vinegar next time i have to clean this out,goatoaster at the time 06 28 something go wrong the mode that you use is to cool down the machine after foaming that by no mean is the machine overheating this is used after foaming up milk to be able to pull a espresso this mode run water thru the boiler to cool it down since espresso is made at a way lower temperature than the steam,recently bought one of these machine it worked twice then went wrong it did not produce enough pressure for the water to flow the coffee got a refund,you probably packed it too much so the water then can not flow through the ground,tua tua were using the single shot i am having the same issue only a little dribble of water come through the coffee,that is odd but good that you could get a refund,thanks for the great review what grinder do you use and have you tried many different one thanks,this is the grinder i use i have used a simple blade grinder but i really like this one,like wet yogurt,instant dry yogurt,a opposed to dry yogurt,too much bl bl bl,i am gon na get this when it get cheaper it is pointless to get such an expensive product then you have got ta get rid of it when you move from one province to another,my filter holder is stuck on the espresso machine too hard to turn the handle any idea to solve this,try loading le coffee ground in the filter i have trouble turning the handle when i load it too full,vedere gli inglesi fare un caff espresso,xdddddddddddd,nice video i bought the same machine and have now re watched the video one thing your video doe not show or maybe i missed it is how to remove the used coffee ground or puck from the machine my puck are like rock and they simply do not come out i have tried everything but i usually end up trying to slice it out with a sharp knife and then scooping the rest out with a spoon i am sure this is not the right way to do it any tip,alexander troy,suz thanks i will try that,just put the unwanted ground through another cycle the compacted ground when wet are easy to dislodge,doe not work with this cheap appliance the basket pop off,alexander troy i have used the preground illy bean but have not had issue that bad,i had a breville but it started leaking at the bottom so returned it to get the delongi both are similar and personally i prefer the delongi,hi if u do not mind me asking what exactly make u like the delonghi over the breville,i have the same machine and i have been using for a few year now couple year ago i managed to open the machine up and changed the steam wand,jj shankles thanks for such a nice practical relatable review i like your relaxed but well organized style question have you done a video on how to modify to the non pressurized use and for your non pressurized what grinder can you use i do not want to pay hundred for a grinder my delonghi is making some pretty good espresso for me but i am interested to try non pressurized if i can do it with my bodum bistro grinder thanks goat toaster oh do you like your goat toast golden brown or dark brown crunchy,how many espresso can you get in a day,i have been thinking about doing that i recently did the unpressurized stump mod and really like it,omg it tfue nice video i almost bought it ended up getting the 420 1 but now i think it a bit too big,hey man loved the review do you think picking up one of these used but in like new condition would be worth it it is nearly half the original price thanks,a m i just bought a new machine with a few year warranty just to be safe,sk8ingthemystery how would that turn out for you im in the exact same predicament it is substantially cheaper to get a like new but i am paranoid,jj shankles sweet thanks for the advice i am picking one up right now,i buy a lot of thing used from amazon and have not had any problem and the saving are substantial amazon also ha great return policy so if it is not like new you can send it back easily,i noticed that by turning the foam handle more in hot water function the pump start to run what doe it change,pretty good review,thanks,thank you a lot i have one and i love it,you will hate it when it start having orange flashing light issue,thanks for showing u how it work i just ordered mine,how do you like it,how do you like it,thanks so much for the video i got the same machine it is awesome,i love the quality of espresso for how easy it is to use now that i have worked out a good system,this wa an excellent video informative and comprehensive while remaining short and lightly entertaining thank you i will buy this machine now,the foam looked like hot milk i am sorry but u guy down there still have not yet understood the difference to have more air in the foam and avoid burning the milk to liquid againg you must touch the surface with the tip of the froathing pen only if the pen is deepened all the way in a she is doing the hot side will burn the milk and if touched the bottom the machine will overheat and stop,thank you alan i usually did it all wrong result the milk wa all over my kitchen,thanks for letting me know i will work on that i usually just drink the espresso black so i do not get much practice frothing the milk but those are great pointer i will try out,my god what a mess u making mate,haha thanks for the laugh could not agree more but a they say you do not give a ferrari to a new driver,use mine multiple time a day my heart beating really fast,lol,thank you for the review i have stayed with the nespresso machine under dollar100 for more than a decade there are many point i do not like they break so easily then i decided to switch to this delonghi dedica deluxe and it is another world feel so professional i ordered box of 150 soft pod from italy borbone napoli it is much cheaper than nespresso aluminum pod and far better and yes the foam and the aroma we love this machine i will try your technique without the pod in amazon europe your tamper is about dollar30,can you use pod,i am so glad you like it i think any metal tamper would be better than the plastic on that come with the machine but even that one doe the job,great i brought the same machine it is just a great one,mine did not come with a frothing cup,did your machine come with the frothing cup,it really is great i love how easily it make great espresso,it is a really good review i am actually only getting started with my new machine and it wa really helpful i am a former barista and it wa my dream to make this kind of coffee at home one day really looking forward to using it and make a perfect coffee with it,bezzzzo hey the silvia steamer doe not fit without some modification took me around 40 min make all the difference for steaming your milk about the unpressurised basket i find it easier to make latte art when using graef unpressurised basket hard to say what the difference is but the pouring of the milk is a lot easier to get it like all youtube video afterwards it is just practicing overall remember while modding to take time it is easy to get thing the wrong way and you will have to disassemble the whole machine hopefully this gave you some answer,mr fredriksson hi mate doe the rancilio steamer fit the delonghi machine or doe it have to be modded also with the unpressurized basket will this also help with making a flat white sorry i am new at this,goattoaster 9 yeah it give about 0 control but if you are drinking plain espresso i would really recommend go and buy the unpressurized basket cut off a piece from the plastic insert of the portaholder you would be amazed of the amount aroma and crema you will get,i have heard good thing about those mod the steam wand that come stock really doe not give much control over how the foam is made,jj shankles do this and thank me later change the steamer to one from rancilio silvia gen2 buy some unpressurized basket graef 145722 cut off a piece of the plastic in the bottom of the portafilter so the new basket can fit some people cut the actual portafilter so they get a naked look but it is not needed best of luck on your barista adventure

bottom,dutch home barista thank you so much for the kind and detail explanation,hi k king there is no standard coarseness it is depending on the bean and factor like humidity if you have new bean you

delonghi,how can i adjust or chose which temperature i want on this maschine,depending on the roast of the bean with dark bean i use the standard middle setting,hello i wa wondering how would you put 14 gram of coffee in the double cup basket my machine doesnt make any coffee and it just choke maybe my grind is too fine or it because i use pressurized cup with fresh ground,drill a bigger hole in the bottom of the basket and you can grind finer and use 14 gram of coffee,maciek k 14g is a bit too much or the grind is too fine if the machine choke i go with 13 or 13 5 max,jataa from pressing the button,dutch home barista 25 second from pressing the button or from after pre infusion or from after first drop hit the cup,thank you very much have a good evening,how you made it i have delonghi ecp 33 21 but i can not make such a creamy foam you have a steam engine like coffee machine in a cafe did you have one or did you change it yourself,i replaced the original wand by a rancilio silvia v1 v2 steam wand the rancilio silvia wand give more focused steam on youtube there are video is on how to do the modification it took me about 30 minute i think it also fit on the ecp 33 21 but you have to check it p even with the rancilio silvia steam wand it took me lot and lot of practice,karen need a coffee,i am in love,i do not get it my dedica kick out steam for a whole 3 second before overheating then it ha to be cooled end up taking 10 minute to steam milk it is so annoying that i do not even use the thing anymore technical support is someone reading the same manual you own back to you over the phone,nvm turn out it wa a smeg machine look like this machine with a different shell on it though the user replied that it worked for them anyway got ta be worth a shot before sending the unit back,i actually saw this problem on another video and the video creator said to wait until the milk frothing light stop flashing before frothing if that light is flashing it mean it is not ready to froth and you have to wait until it stop flashing and remains lit,i am just a user of the machine and have no relation with delonghi but it sound like there is something wrong with our machine you should check your warranty,nope how disappointing i have this delonghi machine too unfortunately it is the same subpar cremma i wish i would have purchased the gaggia classic pro i have never seen so much cremma produced from an expresso machine the gaggia machine is incredible,where did you order your coffee grinder,i bought it in a dutch online store fonq nl,what is the model type of manual bean grinder did you use thanks,the ginder is a gefu lorenzo,thank you for your video you have used single then double shot how wa the coffee taste it is strange that for the single the basket take 9g but for the double the basket take only 14g for nice espresso we need 18g so what is the solution thanx,alessandro cini and do you get double shot for that i mean if u use 14 g do you still need to get 28 g of espresso to have all the three flavor f the coffee sourness creamy sweat and bitterness thank you for your helpful reply,i used the single shot button by accident i prefer to use the double shot button and stop the extraction manualy at 25gram the extraction of this shot wa way to long but it wa okay a a latte i use his machine only for single shot is,nice video btw which grinder is that,dutch home barista thank you,thanks the ginder is the gufu lorenzo not the best grinder for espresso due to the big step it is often to to fine or to coarse,wow u made a nice tulip i also found a way to froth a good milk,cool video thank you i have one question about coffee extraction when it wa choking like in the video i thought it is wrong i thought coffee should extract rather fluently am i wrong or this is actually correct please i am newbie thanks,the choking wa my mistake normaly i use the two cup button and stop the extraction on 25 gram of coffee in this video i accidentaly used the single cup button which resulted in to litte coffee therefore i pressed it twich this is the choking part the extraction in this video is far from ideale the hand grinder i used grind to fine or to course best to aim for 20 25 gram output in 25 30sec,ohh wow lovely,did you custom the steam nozzle if it is true how did you do that i am sorry for my english skill i am japanese,dutch home barista thanks,i replaced the original wand by a rancilio silvia steam wand you can buy the wand on ebay or amazon on youtube there are video is on how to do the modification if you are a bit technical but not that hard to do it took me 30 minute,hello i also have a dedica fairly new with the silvia wand my machine doe not texture very good and it produce wet steam even afer purging the condensation water it add about 18 ml of water into 150 180 ml milk steamed any help or thought thank you,dutch home barista thank you for the insight,my dedica also give some condens while steaming but not that much i think every few second or so i see condens when the block is heating up the silvia wand take longer practice it took me a few week to master it the trick for me wa to place the tip just on the surface of the milk in an angle that make the milk spin,hi the steam wand you purchased it separately or come with the delonghi machine my wife bought the same machine but the wand is the basic one we could not get that kind of foam,i purchased it separately i t a rancilio silvia v1 v2 steam wand you can buy the wand on ebay or anazon on youtube there are video is on how to do the modification it is are a bit technical but not that hard to do it took me 30 minute good the know that even with the rancilio silvia steam wand it take some practice to get good foam,server for bussines,just to enjoy at home,good video thank you for making,doe your coffee taste sour,gayming and enatrmainent i grind the bean myself,gayming and enatrmainent i use coffee bean but i already discover my problem it is the grind my grinder do not let the bean fine enough i just bought a little quantity of grounded coffee for espresso and the coffee got better,dutch home barista do u use grinded coffee bean or pre grinded from store,gayming and enatrmainent no sugar only steamed milk,do you add sugar to your coffee,,pokong cheong hi pokong see the link below for the youtube guide i used,dutch home barista could you share how to replaced,yes i replaced the original steam wand by a rancilio silvia steam wand,what milk do you use for latte art also what grind setting do you use,i use whole milk regarding the grind setting best to aim for 25 30sec brewing time,hello i am thinking to get this one is it easy to replace the steam wand i just want to buy practice for latte art do you think is it good enough for that,to replace the steam wand you have to be a bit technical there are good step by step video on youtube to guide you it took me about 20 30 minute a you can see you can make latte art on this machine but it is a entry level machine and need more practice,awesome video i have been trying to decide between the delonghi and the smeg think i am gon na go with the delongi,the smeg is the same internal machine a this de longhi so the extra cost is only for look,great machine had mine for 3 year will not die,good luck in my experience is the delonghi a geat entry machine,the new wand is thicker and somehow different what are your thought on that,hi victor if you mean the new rancilio silvia want model i do not have experience with it,that wa awful just from looking at the shot the grind doe not look fine enough or the coffee bean are not great is under extracted the initial pour should be much darker and thicker another indicator is the lack of any of proper crema you just have a bit of foam why on earth would you stop the shot then add more water that extra pre infusion and water would make your most definitely sour shot taste even worse just set your single espresso shot to run a bit longer if you want a bit more water,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,delonghi is italian in name only all their espresso machine are made in china and do not last long because of that they use cheap component for everything just like saeco and phillips my advice is to get true italian machine like the one from rancilio they are expensive but they will last like 20 year if you want something that is quality and will last long avoid good made in china especially espresso machine,i think there is a confusion i am a home barista making video on my delonghi ec685 espresso machine i do not have any relationship with a espresso machine manufacturer,what grinder is this,the ginder is a gefu lorenzo,can i ask u something the 9g is it double basket or single basket also why change the wand i put my wand just at that level with the default wand and it splattered the milk everywhere i thought my technique is wrong,alexander khioe maybe the type of bean or the grind size ha something to do with it i use fine grind 9 gram is the maximum i can use in the single basket the maximum coffee i can put in the double basket is 14grams,dutch home barista will search for that anyway how would u even fit 9g of coffee bean in a single basket i am fitting 10g in double basket 7g in a single basket if i try to go more than that the portafilter wont snap to the machine,for 9gram i use the single basket the rancilio silvia steam wand is longer and give more focused power my experience is that the rancilio silvia wand need more practice but after i mastered it my micro foam wa much better i also made a steaming video search for how to steam and froth milk with a delonghi ec680 ec685,very nice thank you for the tutorial,your welcome,why did you pour the milk in the other pitcher before making latte art,this make the milk smoother for latte art,too tedious what u did to make a cup really,a long a the taste is good,you change your wand right,i replaced the original wand by a rancilio silvia steam wand you can buy the wand on ebay or anazon on youtube there are video is on how to do the modification if you are a bit technical but not that hard to do it took me 30 minute,very nice vid but for my machine it real quick for cool down blinking started after i purge out some water from the wand so i need to purge again n reselect the steam option could you help,sound like there is maybe something wrong with you machine on my delonghi i do experience inconsistency in steam pressure and temperature when steaming when that happens i just keep on steaming and the pressure recovers afther a couple of second if steam option stop out of it own then maybe it is good to check your machine,it wa nicer latter art than other youtubers in this machine,thanks it took me a lot of practice,nice video what kind of milk are you using regular 1percent or 2percent,the more fat the smoother and richer the foam is,thanks i use whole milk 3percent fat,i think i need te practice more can you make a video on how to steam the milk,nice milk you make,nice tutorial thank you for making it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,do you make espresso at home what are your tip for better coffee with cheaper home espresso machine,we are in china we use bottomless filter to upgrade the coffee quality they are cheap and easy to find here by the way i am using air pump coffee maker made in china good result and not expansive,i bought the same coffee maker 1 week ago but i can not make an espresso with foam i followed all your step but nothing what do you recommend,my first little krups did really well once the kid grew up i could get a better machine that little machine pumped them out for year,long time dedica user here here are a couple of tip not mentioned or fully explained in the video 1 absolutely do get the proper non pressurised basket you can get it on amazon or elsewhere either with the whole portafilter or just the basket warning the default delonghi portafilter ha a plastic part inside that prevents inserting a deeper proper non pressurised basket but with a little patience and a hacksaw you can simply cut a centimetre or so from the plastic part to make everything fit so you will be able to continue using the default portafilter p ka the pressurised basket allows you to brew essentially anything but you have very little control over brew time in this video they were quite lucky to get something espresso like in most case you will struggle to square a circle it will either choke or brew too quick or you will get inconsistent random result so definitely get the non pressurised basket 2 the button are programmable just push and keep pressing it for the desired length of time it will then remember how long you pressed it very useful when dialling in new coffee just settle on the right dose and grind size get the time right 25 30 s and next time you will get the same result consistently 3 use darker roast look guy i know we are all fan of the light roasted hipster coffee here but this machine can not extract them properly sorry for the allcaps but this point need stressing i learnt it the hard way so perhaps you will not have to if a specialty coffee roastery in czechia and abroad tell you oh do not worry our espresso roast is perfect for home machine they are lying to you it is still way too light roasted to be extracted well by dedica you see the machine doe not really produce high enough temperature even if you set see the manual the water temp to max i remember reading it only get to about 86 c which is simply too low for proper extraction of what modern roaster call espresso or medium roast what you will get will be intensely sour and unpleasant at least to my palate without sugar on the other hand if you use something more traditional doe not have to be very dark just darker than what most specialty coffee roaster usually offer you will get a quite pleasant traditional espresso thick creamy not too bitter not sour sometimes quite sweet i found that brazilian coffee usually work the best with this machine in short look for more developed roast with low acidity 4 steaming milk the wand ha 2 setting use them you can really produce quite acceptable microfoam if you start with the cappuccino setting get some air in and then switch to hot milk to get that vortex swirling going that produce very fine foam it take a bit of practice but it is not hard watch some video on general tip for milk steaming after you finish clean the wand and then you will have to open the valve again to let off the excess heat steam so that the machine return to the normal coffee brewing setting 5 comandante grinder setting naturally this will depend heavily on the coffee bean and dose you are using i only use non pressurised deeper basket and my dose is usually between 17 19 gram the corresponding comandante c40 setting are usually between 7 10 click finer for darker roast coarser for lighter roast be careful not to choke it machine totally you might rupture the o ring in the grouphead it can be easily replaced but be extra careful not to tear the thread on the screw the bed is made of plastic and it can easily happen a you try to tighten it then it will not hold the shower screen properly and the o ring will keep popping out replacing the plastic part is quite a pain in the as for the non mechanic like me so be aware,what is the ratio of milk you used while making cappuccino,is it just me or doe anyone else have problem getting this machine to consistently produce hot temperature,i can not steam milk well in my dedica it push large bubble that pop and make a lot of mess i can not get it silky enough,thanks good video,chia s tuy t v i,nice video sadly bottomless portafilter still ha 15bar of pressure which is not good for a good espresso reducing that would make this machine a real option,but bottomless ortafitlers is not always better otherwise every afe would do that and the majortiy doesnt,your face when you tasted it i bet it wa too acidic d,hey what an excellent video thanks for sharing your expertise,i am using this machine a well and it ha been about 1 year plus i also upgraded with the bottomless portafilter and my espresso is superb tip for making nice latte art or frothing the milk switching your frother to cappuccino for about 10 12 sec than switch back to hot milk you would love the milk texture thank me later p,the bottomless portafilter is available from amazon,can you paste a link,been using this for 15 month work like a dream,which one from that many there are a lot of with bad review,nice video i already use a bottomless portafilter with this machine and the key is get a good enough grinder i use the sage barista one and the combination is fantastic but i couldnt make decent latte with the existing wand i have now removed the metal rod and by just using the existing rubber tube i can make great latte not need to do the rancillo complicated exchange i may see if i can get a longer rubber tube to make it a little easier but by just using the existing rubber tube is a game changer in itself thank you it doe go to show how capable this machine is,when i can find the professional portafilter the name and type,whats the name of the portafilter that you use on video,which portafilter did you use i have checked the link but can not find it,wow thank you for your advice on this machine i wa wondering why my coffee wa not so tasty i will follow your advice an look how i can improve my coffee,this machine keep increasing price in my country it cost approximate 305 euro now,wow that is a lot hope it will go down or you can get something second hand,general question to the other viewer do you also watch these video because you are interested in the process even though you do not like coffee or are you normal,thanks for watching,last year our 685 died and we have decided to buy a new coffee machine after spending 1000euro and 6 month later we have decided to sell it and buy 685 again the reason is simple it is great simple and coffee coffee that 685 make is flawless,hi great video i have the same 2 question can you share the exact name diameter of the portafilter you used and sometimes after pressing the button the water is stuck inside and nothing come out know why thanks,i have the exact appliance and tbh i would not buy it again if i knew i would go with an avx or save up to a gaggia classic,european coffee trip it is a pressurized coffee maker appliance that imo doe not justify it is price you can get the same if not better coffee in some case from cheaper option imo one example would be delonghi is older ec155 secondly you have to invest in accessory or mod it to get the best of it especially a unpressurized portafilter thirdly at least for me it feel full of plastic and cheap fourthly being pressurized the grind greatly affect the extraction you either get a runny diluted coffee or you choke the appliance lastly while i do not expect it at this price point i would like to have more control on the extraction in term of temperature or pressure not just extraction time i know it ha some kind of low mid high setting but i would like more,thanks for sharing what is your main critique about the machine it can be very useful for people considering buying it,i would say the ec685 is a decent machine and when u own one your coffee quality will be a good a your grinder and bean,true,hi can you tell me the grind size for pre ground bean,lovely video,what brand milk did you use from what store,it wa honestly random full fat milk we got at the shop around the corner do not have anything specific to suggest,this wa my first espresso maker when using naked portafilter with non pressurized basket and steaming with the rubber wand and pairing it with a nice grinder it give you amazing latte it is so good that i stopped going to coffee shop highly recommend the upgrade,you can easily depressurize the included portafilter by drilling the outlet to a ca 5 mm hole,or buy non presurrized basket and use the original portafilter,hi for bottomless porta what ratio do you use for double shot,hey around 1 2 3 2 5,the extraction time for a 16 gr using a bottomless portafilter is the same than original pressurized 11 4 gr 25 sec thanks in advance,25 30 sec,hi what size of bottomless portafilter did you use looking to buy one and have the same machine but unsure what the exact size is thanks in advance and great video,51mm,great video i have a delonghi dedica and i have bought a bottomless portafilter similar to the one in your video now i am just waiting for my grinder to arrive i am really looking forward to getting some good coffee out of this thing,thanks,hi i am trying to use solid metal tamper and bottomless portafilter on my ec685 and it resulting in coffee spattering from the bottom around the cup in totally random direction grinder is eureka mignon manuale any change of grind result in same issue,spattering is usually a sign of channelling make sure to break clump and maybe use a distributor wdt tool like a fine needle for example before tamping,my wife love her cappuccino when i steam honey along with the milk i use this brand machine usually but when i want stronger i use an imusa,i apologize not this brand a tengyi the imusa ha no pump us steam pressure only hold double the ground of the tengyi,hello but you don t tell u in part 3 portafilter upgrade in 16 5g the out and the time that you used like part 2 barista routine,hey pixelar i think it wa something like 16 5 38 40g 27 30 sec,i recommend securitng the rubber steam wand with some kind of strap so it wont shoot out while steaming,link to the upgraded portafilter please,great video do you guy count the pre infusion the roast that i use dedica plus eureka mignon and same bottomless portafilter with most of the time 18gr in 36 out come a bit underextracted when i brew 30 sec with pre infusion included so i counr 30 after the the pressure start,it take about 4 5 sec for the extraction to start i count since i press the button we had brew 25 30 sec i think finer grind would get jammed make a really hard time for the machine,great video im getting this machine very soon to go along with my 1zpresso jmax,that sound like a nice combo to play with espresso at home have fun,i bought a bottomless portafilter and a better tamper but i get bad channeling everytime can not figure out the best grinding procedure,european coffee trip i use an electric one but also have a manual one either i am grinding too fine or too coarse but coffee splash everywhere when making an espresso,what grinder do you use,i have this machine but it to cold for brewing,i have the same problem,nar2086 i did try the ro water with scot is mineral profile my best guess is the temp,suba yes and yes before pulliing in put two shot of water through,david koplan do you let the machine warm up before and do you flush the portafilter,if you allow me try using different water if you have not tried that,hi really good video thanks i have the same machine but i had little to no success brewing with the advanced mode first i modified my delonghi coffee grinder to be able to grind finer coffee that worked out great then i tried loading that finer coffee into the pressurized basket but the machine fails to brew it it just pump and barely any coffee come out whatever come out is super bitter at the end i did not tamper the coffee at all just scoop it in and brew and it just simply fails to brew fine coffee i have a feeling the machine ha some trickery with the opv valve and it is just pumping and never releasing pressure completely pressing the coffee together and not letting any water through i have purchased unpressurized basket obviously i had to cut out plastic piece from the portafilter to fit it it is a basket with many hole on the middle but not in the entire basket like yours this wa the only one i found locally but it is not pressurized and that is the point i had better success brewing espresso grind coffee with it but even after many many attempt the quality never come close to the one brew with the pressurized basket on default coarser coffee the output wa always bitter you have no control over the water quantity only the brew length also i think the opv might have some special tuning not really suited for this i wa to be honest surprised it worked for you and now i am suspecting it is something with my machine i wa also suspecting my skill are bad and they might be still but then if you copy everything at least some crappy coffee should come out not undrinkable bitterness so i just go with the crappy machine theory not in general but mine i am a bit tired of upgrading it i also did the wand upgrade and i think i will step forward to a breville dual boiler,d niel bulyovcsity i know this might sound weird but have you cleaned the sieve where the water come out of the appliance mine had a blockage last year that made the coffee taste funny,ketadine hi a i mentioned i did purchase unpressurized filter but anything finer than medium grind and the machine is not able to brew even is i do not tamper it i really really played with it many kilo of coffee went into the bin tried all the different grind setting with different tampering strength it wa never good it might be the machine might be the grinder at the end i do not care to be honest both have to go when i upgrade,i also had this delonghi coffee appliance it is not a machine at this price point and also the grinder i did not mod it but used it at 3 5 based on the coffee if the grind is too fine the appliance basically choke because it try to push water through a plug with a very small point and it can not do that a such you are overbrewing and from there you get the bitterness oh and also the delonghi grinder is not the most consistent one for espresso it might be for french press or pour over but not for espresso now you have 3 option either continue with the pressurized basket and decrease the amount of coffee and increase the grind setting until you find a setting you like setting on a coffee or go non pressurized but with a different portafilter see aliexpress for 51mm bottomless portafilters and again find a setting you like or the third more expensive option upgrade the grinder to a better one imo first come the coffee bean then the grinder and finally the espresso appliance machine i have the baratza encore but i would have gone honestly with either a manual good grinder or save up a bit for a better espresso grinder like the lelit pl 043 fred,you need a better grinder different bean require different grind size,hey i think the grinder is super important maybe try to ask in a local cafe for an espresso grind and check if that is not the case if not then probably something wrong with the machine,hi are tou planing to make an app for android,european coffee trip n thnx,yes it is in making hope to release it in june,hey i am still interested in what your setting for temperature and water hardness were,hey a i mentioned always the highest temperature is the best with this type of machine water hardness depending on the water you use,please provide a link to the bottomless portafilter and handle,okay we need to find out we borrowed it to make the video so we do not have all the detail at hand,the handgrinder is more expensive than the coffee machine if you have more dollar buy good one they are expert we can not have the same result it take time to learn,great to see dedica on your channel guy because of it low price point this should be a go to machine for everyone interested in trying out espresso game at home,exactly enough of the prejudice,nice video always like video with this guy,,thanks tomo is a great presenter with a focus on detail coffee he roast taste amazing too,i wa hoping you would share more tip on dialing in with the pressurised portafilter how much coarser wa the grind size compared to unpressurised how fine should one actually go did you use the single or double basket why did you use that 11g 30g ratio instead of 2 1 did you change the setting to the hottest level cheer,tomo l thanks for the response i find it interesting that you have used a similar grind size i still play around with my old dedica just for fun my daily driver is lelit elizabeth and niche zero and i noticed going a fine a possible would yield pretty bad shot i assumed the pressurised basket needed a coarser grind to compensate also interesting that you used 11g in the double pressurised basket mine can fit quite a bit more all very curious cheer,hey maruel of course a i mention in the video the highest temperature is the best the grind wa very similar we used a double basket we used that ratio because it tasted the best the smaller ratio tasted underextracted hope that help cheer,the dedica and the comandante ha been my setup for almost two year i also have both upgrade my recipe is 17gr in 38gr out at 8 9 click 17 with the red clix would love to know how many click did you use great video guy,alberto sendra i am in the exact same position a you with similar upgrade i am tempted by a manual espresso maker though a they can pull fantastic espresso at a low price point beyond that it would be a case of spending closer to the gbp1000 mark for a true long term upgrade,alberto on the shooting day i had almost the same recipe d 16 5g and 17clicks thanks for sharing and totally agree 100percent with your sum up of dedica basically we tried to showcase what you have written hi5,dan firth keep in mind that i bought this a my entry in the espresso world i can not really say how much better thing would be with a better machine gaggia classic rancilio silvia but once i got a good grinder a non pressurized filter and a botomless portafilter so i could really see and improve my puck preparation the quality of the shot is very very good in my opinion and everyone enjoys them a lot my biggest con would be the low steam power and being 51mm there are no precision filter basket vst etc and also the puck is quite thick for a 17gr shot also due to the small size is quite annoying to have a coffe scale while pulling the shot for the price i paid 150 euro 50 on upgrade i could not have asked for a better machine and a a newbie it ha allowed me to experiment and improve my technique i would be lying if i said i wa not planning on upgrading to something better but i am looking for something in the 1k range because i do not think a gaggia classic or a rancilio silvia would be a noticeable enough improvement,hey i never comment to others so i hope you do not mind how ha your experience been with your machine i am moving out in two week and would love some real world feedback from a coffee person i have a decent grinder and filter setup but would love to know if you rate the machine enough to pick one up cheer,we are waiting a picopresso review,hi thanks for the video can you make a video about making espresso and cappuccino with delonghi eco310,thanks for the video how much coffee for single shot,how many click on the comandante c40 did you use both for the original portafilter and for the non pressurized one have you ground finer for the non pressurized one,alberto sendra thans for sharing alberto,hey martin the grind wa similar around 14 17 click with red clix although there is circa 5g difference in coffee amount,i have the exact same setup and my recipe is 17gr in 38gr out at 8 9 click 17 with the red clix using a non pressurized naked portafilter hope they answer with theirs,,i have had a delonghi dedica for a while now and these tip have been really handy a i have wanted to try and upgrade eventually what wa the upgraded port filter that you used,tomo l thanks for the advice,hey james happy to hear it wa interesting to you for the portafilter or basket that you can buy and use delonghi portafilter google anything that is 51mm,neouza amazon,european coffee trip thank you very much,thanks good question i will try to get the answer for you asap i assume it wa not too specific or high level portafilter though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,4 tuning tipps um au eurer delonghi dedica ec685 alles raus zu holen ab sofort versenden wir unsere kaffees auch nach deutschland via kaffeemacher de maschine und sieb und milchlanze zur verbesserung bei amazon welche erfahrungen habt ihr mit der maschine gemacht wir sammeln eure feedback hier wenn ihr euch maschinentests w nscht schreibt und da gerne al kommentar auf dieser seite wir aktualisieren hier regelm ig unsere testliste,e gibt f r die ec685 eine pumpe ulka ex4 48w 230v 50hz mit 18bar alle anschl sse sind identisch einfach austauschen viel mehr druck ist e dennoch nicht aber jetzt schafft e die maschiene bei sehr feinem kaffeemehl und dem doppelwandtr ger ich glaube allerdings da aufgrund de gesteigerten drucks der durchsatz etwas geringer ist aber da kann auch t uschen hab da eben erst umgebaut wenn man sich mit der maschine erstmal angefreundet hat sattelt man nicht um auf die graef hatte ja mal eine gr f da und den teppichklopfer wollte ich mir nicht antun e reicht mir wenn die kaffeem hle von graef so laut ist und in punkto zerlegbarkeit ist graef einfach total unkomfortabel zumindest wenn man die m hle mit der dosierautomatik besitzt die graef kaffeem hle hat ein mahlwerk welches leider sehr schwer zu justieren ist wenn der ring so tief wie m glich geschraubt wird zieht e nicht mehr ein da pulver wird sch n fein aber weil nix mehr nachkommt orgelt die einfach leer pr zise kann die maschine nicht und der tote kaffeeanteil ist einfach gigantisch weil der propeller mit seinen schaufeln gigantisch ist da ist jedoch nur so weil die nichts davon verstehen und gerne alten oxidierten kaffee trinken grunds tzlich hasse ich jede kaffem hle au plastik schlecht zu reinigen und sieht einfach billig au im fall der graef nimmt der kunststoff den gestank und somit auch alles m glich auf ausserdem ist die temperatur in einem trichter au plastik h her al bei einem au edelstahl und alu ist auch nur solange sch n solange e beschichtet ist sieht man ja beim siebtr ger der delonghi ec685 etc aber au china gibt e ja gl cklicherweise f r 25euros siebtr ger au edelstahl ohne boden mit holzgriff,welchen tamper k nnt ihr empfehlen,kaffeemacher akademie amp r sterei testet doch bitte einmal die quickmill orione 3000 vielen dank im vorraus und super video weiter so,ich habe die formel nicht ganz verstanden 13g x 2 5 26 gt warum teilt ihr die 13g nochmal durch 2 und addiert sie zu den 26 soda ein ergebnis von 32 5 zustande kommt k nnt ihr mir da kurz erkl ren bitte,ab welchem zeitpunkt messt ihr die zeit ab dr cken de knopfes oder ab dem ersten tropfen,hallo ihr kaffeemacher ihr macht da super mit euren test macht weiter so in der preisklasse k nntet ihr doch mal die a1 von briel testen glaub die k nnte interessant sein im einstiegsbereich,leider ist die dedica meiner ansicht nach nicht wirklich f r guten espresso zu gebrauchen e hat sicher auch einen grund da die maschine mit diesen doppelsieben ausgeliefert wird da da ganze konzept der maschine ja darauf basiert nutzt man da graef doppio sieb ist e definitiv nicht m glich trotz guter m hle und feinstem mahlgrad eine gute ratio zu erzeugen da die laufzeit immer zu kurz ist oder am ende zu viel espresso in der tasse landet dazu w rde man einen mahlgrad oder eine kaffemenge ben tigen die da sieb oder die m hle sage smartgrind nicht leisten k nnen mein ziel und mein anspruch sind e nicht einen in irgendeinerweise trinkbaren espresso zu produzieren sondern e sollte schon ein gewisser anspruch gewahrt bleiben,da video ist gut aber der ton ist wirklich ganz fies st ndiger lautst rkenwechsel da sollte eigentlich bei der videobearbeitung teil der aufgabe sein,ich habe mir ein delonghi sonderangebot au der fundgrube bestellt f r 200euros eine delonghi ec 685 mit der kg521 m hle und etwas zubeh r ich werde die m hle mit einer passscheibe anpassen und ein besseres sieb einbauen ich bin echt gespannt wa ich da f r insgesamt knapp ber 200euros rausholen kann,kann man einstellen wie lange da wasser beim espresso durchl uft,hallo alle zusammen ihr macht super video und bin begeistert werder ihr eig die kombi mit der m hle von delonghi empfehlen wenn ich damit haupts chlich milchvariationen und normalen kaffee mache vielen dank im voraus komplett leihe und besitze zurzeit eine nespresso maschinexd,meinst du die kg521 die kann nicht fein genug mahlen da kann aber mit wenig aufwand umgebaut werden,den kleber mit normalen l versuchen und einschmieren einwirken lassen und reiben dann mit sp li reinigen wenn nicht weg nochmal den schritt machen,ich habe mir eine de longhi ec 7 gebraucht gekauft die aufsch umfunktion ist da f r milch mir ist nur unklar ob ich die milch vorher erw rmen mus oder nicht,aceton h tte den kleber entfernt,auf jeden fall voll sympathisch,hallo ich glaube so langsam hat mich da espressovirus erwischt ich sehe mir nun immer fter eure beitr ge an und bin geneigt mir eine maschine anzuschaffen gerade auch weil man da so sch n zelebrieren kann und ich zum gourmet geworden bin seit ich nicht mehr rauche mein favorit ist derzeit die sage barista pro aber sie ist auch entsprechend kostenintensiv die gastrobackmaschine hat nicht die beste m hle wenn da geld nicht so locker sitzt hat man e offenbar nicht leicht al m hle halte ich die cm 800 von graef f r geeignet gibt e ne kombi die ihr mir al einsteigerempfehlung nennen k nntet vermutlich ist e sinnvoll eine espressomaschine ohne m hle anzuschaffen und nat rlich die passende m hle dazu ich w re euch dankbar f r einen tipp vom fachmann sozusagen macht weiter so gr e frank,nix gutes,moin hab da ne frage zu der maschine und hoffe ihr lest noch die comment ich habe mir f r den ersten anfang diese maschine und eine geringe menge frisch gemahlenen kaffee au meinem lokalen kontor geholt hier erz hlte ich von der maschine die verk uferin stellte ihre m hle auf espresso feinheit ein eure anleitung habe ich genau befolgt erstes problem ich kann die maschine grade so auf euer flussziel von 32ml einstellen weil die maschine alles unter 30ml nicht nimmt aber e ging grade so hauptproblem hnlich wie bei euch l uft der doppelte bei mir ab knopfdruck in 20 inklusive der pr infusion entsprechend 32ml im becher durch der kaffe schmeckt nicht mal unangenehm s uerlich und nahezu gar nicht bitter kaum bi keine crema jetzt meine frage warum so schnell und wie soll man da verlangsamen ich dachte der pressurized basket sollte auch mit falscher partikelgr e daf r sorgen das die extraktionszeit entsprechend lang ist au erdem wurde mir im kontor versichert das die partikelgr e fein genug sei um auch mit unpressurized siebtr gern gute ergebnisse zu erzielen ein abweichen von guten 33percent vom der zielzeit finde ich da schon eklatant daneben wa meint ihr liebe gr e,kleber ckst nde k nnen m helos mit wd 40 entfernt werden,hey ich glaube die frage wurde schon h ufig gestellt und bestimmt auch bereits beantwortet aber ich finde die antwort aktuell nirgends starte ich da z hlen der zeits bereits ab dem moment de dr ckens und der vorbr hung oder erst nach der vorbr hung wenn e zum zweiten mal zu brummen anf ngt danke,richtig cooles review ich finde euren ehrlichen und offenbar unparteiischen umgang auch mit maschinen im ganz niedrigen preissegment richtig cool ich mag eure video euren blog und vor allem die art wie ihr euer know how der breiten masse zur verf gung stellt herzlichen dank daf r ich kann viel mitnehmen gr sse au hessen,hallo ihr sympathischen kaffeemacher nachdem ich mir einige clip von euch angesehen habe f hle ich mich gut informiert und werde mir nun eine baratza sette 30 mit einer dedica besorgen danke an euch und prost,sind die 25 sekunden br hhei en mit oder ohne vorbr hung gemeint ich bin bei 13gramm in und 33 gramm in der tasse bei 25sek beim dreispitz sehr sauer und hab keine ahnung warum,hat wer eine idee f r ein einwandiges sieb da ca 14g gemahlenen kaffee reinbekommt ich habe die graef siebe bestellt und sie passen auch gut aber leider passt in da 1 shot sieb nur ca 11 g rein und und da 2 shot sieb etwas 20g ich w rde am liebsten etwas dazwischen bekommen any tip,zur wassermenge heisst da wenn ich den extrahierten espresso wiege sollten da 33g raus kommen oder weniger weil feuchtigkeit im pulver bleibt,ich werde da gef hl nicht los das benjamin fast ein wenig sauer ist weil man mit dieser g nstigen maschine ein gutes ergebnis erzielen kann gerade weil der weg zu diesem ergebnis wirklich kein hexenwerk ist,soll man die espressomenge mit wasser abmessen oder mit kaffee d,hallo liebe kaffeemacher ich trinke gerne kaffee und freue mich immer ber einen guten espresso die delonghi ec 685 habe ich schon seit l ngerem ich habe auch eine gute kaffeebohne mir damals aber eine billige kaffeem hle gekauft nun wollte ich eigentlich auf eine neue maschine umsteigen und bin auf eure video gesto en die video sind grandios zum gucken und ich habe einige eurer ideen sofort umgesetzt ich habe mir einen neuen bodenlosen siebtr ger bestellt und die smart grinder von sage und ich mus sagen der espresso ist mindestens doppelt so gut wie zuvor bitte macht weiter so,eine frage ist da sieb in dem siebtr ger au edelstahl oder aluminium,hallo ich habe mal eine frage die menge die du da gemacht hast ist angibst ist ein 13gr kaffee frisch gemahlen f r einen espresso oder sind da ein espressi also quasie doppelter espresso,v llig ok wird mein pers nliches wort de jahres,besten dank f r den super berblick meine 680 hat gerade ihren geist aufgegeben und ersatz mus her wollte direkt 685 kaufen frage mich jetzt aber wa e mit der 785 auf sich hat ist die in den zentralen aspekten identisch und hat nur mehr zubeh r und ist etwas besser verarbeitet oder ist da ein trugschluss dankesch n,tolles video bei meiner nagelneuen dedica tritt kein kaffee au mus da einzige loch unterhalb de siebtr gers extra durchsto en gibt e alternative klassische siebtr ger,vielen dank f r da sehr informative video ich habe mir die maschine ebenfalls geholt und bin soweit auch zufrieden nur mit der temperatur bin ich noch nicht so ganz zufrieden trotz einstellung auf h chster stufe der espresso ist trotzdem nicht richtig heiss ich lasse vorab auch immer eine tasse leer durchlaufen ich hoffe das mit meiner maschine alles in ordnung ist vielleicht hat da ja noch jemand ein tipp f r mich,fazit e ist okkeee,hallo super beitrag ich berleg mir diese maschine f r den einstieg zu holen interessieren w rde mich kann man auch langen kaffee der dann auch schmeckt damit zubereiten habt ihr daf r ggf auch noch einstellungstipps parat danke,hallo danke f r die tollen video k nnt ihr mal die neue kitchenaid testen,hammer ihr zwei seit ja echt der mega knaller ich hab keine ahnung von dem thema durch zufall ist dy da erstes video zu espressomaschinen und jetzt wei ich meiner meinung nach schon alles wa ich wissen mus normalerweise recherchiere ich tagelang zu einem thema ich bin euch wirklich dankbar und werde euch in jedem zuk nftigem gespr ch weiterempfehlen danke,mich w rde interessieren wa ihr von den filterpatronen haltet die man zur enth rtung de wassers in den wassertank einsetzen kann,hab die kaffem jle cm 800 von graef mit den doppelwandigen sieben aber keine gute idee schafft garnicht genug druck aufzubauen mus dann schon mehrere doppelte beziehen damit berhaupt tropfen rauskommen mit gr berem mahlgut funktioniert e schon aber da h tte e auch eine noch g nstigere m hle getan l sst sich diesis problem mit einwandigen sieben l sen die von graef sollen ja angeblich gnaz gut sein aber passen wohl nicht so gut in den siebtr ger,wer legend kann hat vorteil lane in cappucino mode stollen und da schau kommt von allen und ist fein genug fuer 95pc der leute und ist sehr leise beim sch umen kauft dann ein 5 eur normsieb und fertig,wir k nnen auf jeden fall legend mode,ein tolles video eine gute maschine und im bundle zu empfehlen aber schade da hier beim geh use und im siebtr ger auf kunststoff gesetzt wird so ein siebtr ger braucht masse also gewicht damit man die maschine nicht fest halten mus wenn man den siebhalter einspannt,kann mir einer sagen in welchem video die zusammenh nge zwischen mahlgrad extraktionszeit und extraktionsmenge erkl rt werden bei meiner dedica standarddoppelsieb schmeckt der espresso sauer nach 13g gemahlener bohne graef cm800 stufe 14 und 2 5x extraktionsmenge ich bin ratlos hab mir auch den empfohlenen bodenlosen siebtr ger gekauft in dem sieb steht 2 und da gehen aber mind 17g rein da hab ich doch hinterher viel zu viel espresso f r mein mixgetr nk ich hoffe mir kann jemand helfen,,die maschine entspricht der audioqualit t,kann man irgendwo die espressotassen kaufen,ja die gibt e hier,wenn ich diese mit den funktionen mit eurem teuren 1000euros maschinen video vergleiche hat diese einen extremen vorteil vom einschalten bi zum ersten kaffe vergehen keine 5 min in der zeit wo die anderen noch am hochheizen sind habe ich 5 g ste mit cappuccino versorgt da kann eine xenia nicht mithalten auch die anderen gt 1000euros haben keine automatische wassermenge zeit da ist einfach bei maschinen ber 200euros pflicht,kleiner kommentar zum thema aufkleber wenn e mit wasser und sp li nicht geht einfach mal wd40 versuchen hat dann bei mir oft extrem einfach geklappt,sind nat rlich echte first world problem aber trotzdem danke daf r schenk die maschine meiner frau zum geburtstag,hallo ihr zwei ihr habt mir schon sehr geholfen k nnt ihr mir eine gute bohne f r diese maschine empfehlen und den malgrad f r die graef m hle vielen lieben dank schon mal und macht weiter so macht echt spa euch zuzuschauen viele gr e sabine,welche m hle w rdet ihr denn empfehlen f r die ec 685,13g die kaffeem hlen mit waage sind extrem teuer ist da ungef hr ein l ffel der dazu geliefert wird,korrektur s video ab minute 9 00 der siebtr ger ist nicht au chrom stahl sondern au alu,vielen vielen dank jung f r da video e war sehr hilfreich f r mich zum entscheiden ich liebe cappuccino mit doppelter espresso am vormittags f r mich e ist ein ritual mit bio kaffeebohnen und bio frische vollmilch ich habe einede longhi kaffemaschine vollautomat seit 10 jahren und funktioniert immer noch gut aber der reinigungsservice kostet 270 chf nie wieder kaufe ich mir eine vollautomat zum richtige reinigen man mus die maschine demontieren die delonghi barista pak kostet rund 400 chf und wenn ich da kaufe und da ergebnis meine erwartungen nicht entspricht ich verzichte lieber 2 jahren auf neuen zu kaufen und kaufe mir la specialista de longhi ahh die tonqualit t ist nicht so wichtig,ich komme beim br hen nicht auf die 25 sekunden br hzeit wie kann ich da verbessern ich komme maximal auf 17 sekunden,professionelle video kompliment euch beiden,hallo liebe kaffeemacher ich habe ebenfalls die dedica und habe folgendes problem bekommen bisher hatte ich fertigen filterespresso gekauft der lief problemlos in den 25 sek ca durch da ich espresso und cappuccino liebe habe ich in eine sage grinder pro jetzt investiert sobald ich dort meine bohnen gemahlen habe und den wasserbezug starte l uft e nur tr pfchenweise durch den tr ger habe nun verschiedene mahlgrade eingestellt aber e kommt mir so vor al ob die dedica zu wenig druck aufbaut damit wasser durchflie t bevor ich jetzt in eine neue siebtr germaschine investiere habt ihr eventuell einen tipp wie da wasser wieder normal durchflie en kann,hi i have this machine with a bottomless portafilter if i use 16g in and 40g out same 1 to 2 5 ratio doe the timing stay the same at 25 second or should the timing be longer since i am using more coffee and water,ich schau grade und einen tamper mit 50mm finde ich nicht e gibt 49mm und 51mm ich nehme an ihr meintet 49mm,ne kurze frage an den pad sieben heist da e findet ein pad ala senseo platz oder ist e auch m glich die doppelten pad ala senseo cappuccino zu verwenden meine freundin trinkt keinen richtigen cappuccinatore nur diesis pad ged n wenn da doch beides kombiniert ist w re da ne gute einsteiger maschine mit padfunktion f r die freundin,nur ese pad 44mm passen rein demn chst werde ich testen ob der espresso gut wird,leider nerven diese lautstarken unterschiede in diesem video bitte beim n chsten video darauf achten,kleiner tipp einfach oliven l f r da entfernen der aufkleber reste verwenden,the guy with the beard is really really serious he did not even crack one smile during the whole thing,bin siebtr geranf nger habe mit deiner hilfe gerade eben einen wirklich guten espresso gezogen ganz herzlichen dank an dich euch ihr vermittelt auf eine sehr angenehme und witzige art fachwissen da anwendbar und die geschmacksinne sensibilisiert,betr kaffeemehlmenge bei den verwendeten sieben expresso 12g doppelter nur ca 15g da passt wa nicht,espresso und doch da stimmt so da einersieb hat nicht halb so viel volumen daher auch nicht die doppelte halbe menge,eine frage zu der brewratio bei der maschine programmiert man die wassermenge mit oder ohne kaffee im siebtr ger ohne kaffee kommt 32g wasser in der tasse an mit kaffee bleiben dann noch 22g brig wahrscheinlich weil der kaffee ja auch wasser speichert,michel ist in dem 1 vergangen jahr 10 jahre gealtert,habe mit der kaffeemaschine probleme vielleicht kann mir wer helfen habe alles nach gebrauchsanweisung eingestellt leider kommt der kaffee nur tr pfenweise soll ich da loch evtl aufbohren auf 1mm hat wer erfahrungen damit bin ber jede antwort dankbar,kaffeemacher mist habe mir im tchibo eine packung mahlen lassen sollte beim n chsten mal erw hnen e n chstes mal gr ber zu mahlen oder evtl doch in eine ordentliche kaffee m hle investieren vielen dank f r die schnelle antwort,gr ber mahlen,richtiges sieb kann man nachkaufen d,guy thanks for making this video and the rest of the valuable content i would like to share my experience and challenge with dedica ec 685 after several month of use my setup is dedica eureka silenzio grinder i have a single bottom filter basket for two cup and original double bottom my biggest challenge wa consistent extraction at what seems to be that sweet spot for a particular coffee type i did pretty well in avoiding channeling playing with the right amount of coffee and extraction time keeping everything clean and yes sometimes result were surprisingly good but sometimes the acidity bitterness wa present that i could not explain i understand that there are people who might not have this issue and are perfectly happy with their cup of espresso from the single bottom filter basket on dedica i am just not one of them now come the part why i am writing this after month of using a single bottom re watching this video i decided to give it a try with 13 gram in the double bottom basket that came with the machine i wa surprised how good coffee wa and how easy it is to consistently reproduce the same taste compared to a single bottom filter and le messy even without channeling i wa too focused on getting that right shoot with single bottom and completely overlook double bottom i am using a relatively fine grind setting but avoid much force when tampering just enough to make coffee sit nice and clean inside the basket hope this will be of some help to anyone struggling with the single bottom filter on this machine,this is strange i am just ordered new dedica because old one is broken and i also ordered single layer non pressurized basket everyone say that espresso is much better with this type of basket i am not satisfied with original basket so i have to test it i need to grind fine and press a lot to get extraction time around 23 25 and 1 2 5 1 3 ratio we will see soon,uhm aber durchlauf war weit unter 25 sekunden wie kommts,da w rde ich dann eher die kleine gaggia classic kaufen 100 euro mehr aber schon super und wa bringt e f r 200 euro eine kaffemaschine zu kaufen und dann 300 euro f r eine m hle auszugeben,hi ich bekomme die 32 5 gramm ungef hr hin aber die zeit ist viel zu kurz bei mir mus ich den kaffe noch feiner mahlen ich habe eine graef cm 800 und auf stufe 5 stehen finde ich schon ziemlich fein danke f r die tipps,da kann man pauschal nicht sagen weil e komplett vom innengewinde abh ngt da ist individuell verstellbar verstellt,teuer ist nicht immer gut,kleberr ckst nde gehen mit l und gut rubbeln ab danke f r da video,dementsprechend ist der gro e siebtr ger f r einen einfachen espresso geeignet und f r einen doppelten m sste ich 2 ber hrungen durchf hren,lieber michel aeschbacher haben sie schon mal diese espressomaschine delonghi dedica ec 685 mit der delonghi icona eco311 w oder delonghi ecov311 vergliechen liebe gr e,de longhi ec 685 um 200eurosergattert bin sehr zufrieden aber aber entkalkung leider nicht m glich macht bitte da einmal ein video,machen wir wa zu interessant das sie im moment in de so teuer ist die maschine kostet in ch 150 euro,h h h eine espresso maschine unter 5000euros da kann nur abfall sein f r die unterschicht da kann man ja auch nur 2euros kaffe einf llen ja wem da schmeckt der sollte lieber gleich sozialhilfe beantragen,hallo from russia ty for this video,danke f r den test und die tipps habe die maschine seit 2 jahren und bin mir sicher mit den tipps wesentlich besseren espresso machen zu k nnen,den testsieger aufkleber einfach in der schliffrichtung de edelstahls entfernen dann klappt da r ckstandslos zumindest bei meiner,tipp um klebereste zu entfernen tuch mit etwas l benetzen und die klebereste damit einreiben anschlie end mit sp lmittel entfernen kleber basieren h ufig auf fettbasen daher verbinden sie sich gut mit l sp lmittel entfernt dann deutlich einfacher die so gel sten klebereste funktioniert in 99percent der f lle,hallo danke f r da aufschlussreiche video eine kleine fragen hab ich dennoch die zeitangabe der extraction bsp 25 30sec ist die inklusive oder exklusive de vorbr hen,inklusive,danke ihr seid die guten steige jetzt mit der maschine ein heute und freue mich aufs experimentieren,guten tag welchen mahlgrad habt ihr f r die de longhi dedica eingestellt,wo finde ich denn den angek ndigten sage sieb link,haben wir gel scht da e nicht mehr kompatibel zu sein scheint,sehr cooles video mich h tte e auch gefreut ein tutorial zum cafe crema zu sehen,danke f r den guten beitrag k nnt ihr mir sagen ob die neue krups virtuoso baugleich ist mit der delonghi dedica sprich gibt e nur optische unterschiede oder auch welche in der qualit t wenn letzteres werdet ihr die krups virtuoso demn chst einmal testen,w re die dedica auch geeignet f r langen kaffee creme l uft da wasser schnell genug durch die br hgruppe ich glaub max 20 sekunden war ein kriterium da ihr mal erw hnt hattet in nem video,felix korff ich habe gestern gelesen das man da einstellen kann bei der dedica und e daher theoretisch gehen k nnte,w rde mich auch interessieren glaube fast nicht habe sie auch und ich meine da wasser ist nicht schnell genug,meine frau war von euren ausf hrungen ganz begeistert da unsere alte de longhi eco 311 r icona gerade da zeitliche gesegnet hat wird diese gleich bestellt danke,toll gemacht da war mir wirklich eine hilfe die akustik l sst zu w nschen brig leute,hallo sie beide ich benutze diese maschine schon drei jahre und bin sehr zufrieden mit ihr um so mehr freut mich ihr video habe ich doch bisher fast alles richtig gemacht sogar einen festen schaum kann ich herstellen wa wohl an der milchsorte liegen mag und an der milchmenge ich danke ihnen f r diese sch ne weiter f hrende vorstellung lgingried,hat jemand nen passenden temper gefunden,gutes video akustik leider katastrophal,ein tipp f r euch macht bitte mal blindtests von espressi und co wenn man h rt wie ihr ber manche dinge redet bekommt man doch schnell den eindruck das ihr sagt der kaffee hier ist geil weil die maschine 7000euros kostet und der hier ist so joaa naja weil die maschine 200euros kostet wissenschaftlich wird is erst mit einem blindtest und e w re sicher ein spannendes video,alpha kralle habe ich james hoffmann testet ger te auch so gut wie nie im blindtest mus aber auch sagen das seine einsch tzung der dedica eher meinen erfahrungen entspricht und er ist da deutlich negativer insofern doch noch mehr plus an die kaffeemacher das sie die maschine so gn dig bewertet haben spricht eher noch f r sie al gegen sie und unterstreicht meinen standpunkt das sie gerade nicht abgehoben sind,draht maul guck dir mal james hoffmann an der macht is bei solchen test richtig,da ist doch schwachsinn klar w re ein blindtest objektiv aber die faktoren die eine gute espressobr hung ausmachen sind auch bekannt und objektiv die kaffeemacher loben brigens auch deutlich g nstigere maschinen al 7000 euro f r ihre espressoqualit t oftmals haben diese in detail dann doch da nachsehen gegen ber teureren maschinen e wird aber stets betont das der kaffee lecker ist diesis und jenes in der verarbeitung milchschaumperformance etc aber besser sein k nnte verstehe nicht wie man darauf kommen kann das sie hier einfach stumpf die teuer gut schiene fahren aber die leute f hlen sich nat rlich auch immer schnell angegriffen in ihrem setup habe brigens auch ne dedica,onkel iroh na dann kann man doch mal einen blindtest machen dann wird man ja sehen ob die herr solche profis sind,hab ich fr her auch immer gedacht bi ich mir selber die linea mini gekauft hab e hat schon einen grund warum die maschine 4600 kostet da zahlst du nicht nur wegen dem namen erst jetzt wei ich wie schlecht der kaffee au der sage oracle touch war die ich vorher hatte und da ist auch keine billige maschine gewesen aber bestimmte marken oder maschinen sind einfach in einer eigenen liga da schmeckst du auch probier einfach mal einen kaffee au deiner neben einer teuren maschine und du willst keinen anderen mehr haben da problem ist einfach euch fehlt selber der vergleich die meisten menschen k nnen sich halt die maschinen nicht leisten ich eigentlich auch nicht,bitte weniger superlativen stapeln ganz ganz ganz klein seh sehr sehr skeptisch mega mega mega schwierig etc unn tige f llworte lg,hallo benjamin k nnten sie eventuell eine testung von vollautomaten vorziehen danke im voraus,welcher von euren kaffees w rdet ihr empfehlen,kaffeemacher super danke f r die schnelle antwort ich war zu voreilig und habe gestern den dreispitz amp bio pat bestellt ich denke der passt auch ich bin noch totaler neuling und habe mir mal die de longhi gekauft weil wir oft imwohnmobil unterwegs sind und dann vermutlich pat verwenden werden danke f r die informativen und unterhaltsamen video liebe gr e marion und han georg,alle mit der dedica den apas,hallo vlt kann mir hier jemand helfen ich habe mir die delonghi dedica ec 685 zugelegt bekomme mit ihr aber keinen leckeren kaffee creme hin bohnen mahlen tempen und dann bei 30 sek bei mittlerer hitzeeinstellung ab daf r der extrahierte kaffee schmeckt aber einfach nur bitter hat jemand erfahrungen mit dieser siebtr germaschine einen caf cr me zu machen,danke viel gelernt wa haltet ihr von dem ger t,,ich habe da ding geschenkt gekriegt kompliment an euch ich mus nach jedem kaffee die komplette k che sauber machen ddd,al qualit ter bin ich von eurer art angetan behaltet die qualit t eurer test bei seid durchaus mutig auch niederpreisige dinge anzuschauen immer nur im top level tummeln ist keine kunst und dann auf hohem niveau quengeln eigentlich ist e ja ein niedriges niveau sondern ganz sachlich begr ndet die wesentlichen dinge herauszustellen die ist euch m e gerade mit diesem test dieser maschine und dem video gut gelungen da gepl nkel am anfang darf durchaus etwas straffer daherkommen und dadurch schneller zielf hrender sein wa mir gut gefallen hat das eure hohen anspr che nicht so gewaltsam durchgeschlagen haben sondern ihr euch um ein ausgewogenes urteil bem ht habt dy ist toll und finde ich zeige eure handwerklich ordentliche grund haltung und dabei habe ich noch viel lernen k nnen vielen dank mit besten gr en au badischen landen nebenan sozusagen,ich war nicht sicher mit dem einstellung f r cappuccino danke,f r alle die den einstieg in die kaffeewelt mit der dedica wagen wollen aktuell steht meine mit s mtlichen modifikationen und extra nach inspiration au diesem video zum verkauf,kann im sage oder graf zweitassensieb auch zum beispiel nur 10 gramm zubereiten oder wird dann nicht genug druck aufgebaut oder ist die menge im siebtr ger egal,hallo zusammen zuerst einmal danke f r eure informativen video ich habe mir vor ein paar monateneine dedica ec685 gekauft und den siebtr ger sowie die dampflanze modifiziert bei eher dunkel ger stetem kaffe bekomme ich nun ziemlich zufriedenstellende ergebnisse ich hatte nun jedoch ein paar eher helle r stungen versucht und der kaffee wurde immer ziemlich sauer auch bei extraktionszeiten von 30sek oder sogar dr ber ich habe ebenfalls versucht vor dem brauen den siebtr ger mit heisswasser zu w rmen da ich dachte eventuell liegt e am temperaturabfall jedoch sind die ergebnisse nicht wirklich berzeugend habt ihr dazu vielleicht erfahrungen oder tipps,hallo mit therischen len z b lavendel kann man super die r ckst nde de klebers entfernen,schon bel wenn man da lachen deutet die 10 000 euro maschinen versus so eine kleine plastikbombe au italien die auch noch gut aussieht ich w rde euch zwei mal bei einer blindverkostung sehen wollen da w re ein spa aber die 10 000 euro boiler m ssen bestimmt besser sein mal billig contra megateuer da w re ein video wert e lebe die kaffeeindustrie toll der schlu satz gutes wasser guter kaffee und richtige temperatur 3x dinge,24 02 der strahlt ja vom herzen,welches fassungsverm gen haben denn die verwendeten metallbecher und woher bekomme ich diese gr e au berlin,wa f r ein schn sel e gibt auch leute die keine 5000euros f r eine kaffeemaschine ausgeben k nnen verw hnter bengel,e wurde ja auch nie behauptet das man eine maschine f r 5000 euro ben tigt ich w rde mir auch nie einen teuren wein kaufen verstehe aber da qualit t ihren preis hat und das leute bereit sind diesen preis zu zahlen und mit unter 200 euro geh rt die maschine aber ganz einfach zur g nstigsten kathegorie kann dementsprechend auch nur so gut abliefern und sie betonen ja immer wieder das sie daf r trotzdem gut abschneidet und wie man da beste herausholen kann,gutes video danke,bitte mal einen test von der bezzera hobby machen ist eine sehr g nstige einsteiger maschine mit bz br hgruppe,kann jemand einer armen kaffeegenie erin die e aber trotzdem nicht unbedingt so feinschmeckerisch haben mus eine zur delonghi dedica passenden kaffeem hle im preisbereich von 50euros bevorzugt elektrisch aber wenn da gar nicht geht dann nat rlich manuell empfehlen sie w re extrem dankbar,sehr guter test vielen dank aber macht doch mal wa mit eurer mikrofonierung der ton ist oft sehr indirekt ihr sprecht nicht immer in die kamera sehr halliger ton oft nicht gut verst ndlich ein oder besser 2 f r euch beide lavalier mikro mit funk w re da optimal,da ist ein lteres video k nnen e leider im nachhinein nicht mehr ndern,servus top video sehr gute produkt vorstellung und beschreibung macht weiter so,hallo zusammen erstmal vielen dank f r die hilfreichen video ich mal ne kleine bitte und zwar k nnt ihr mal ein video ber die aldi ambiano espresso maschine mit mahlwerk drehen bzw testen ich dank euch ganz herzlich und freue mich bald von euch zu h ren viele gr e,sch ne video ihr seid schuld habe mir die maschine jetzt bestellt um zu sehen ob ich bock auf siebtr ger hab habe jahrelang einen vollautomaten gehabt und bin durch reparatur wieder auf filterkaffee gekommen habe mir ne m hle wilfa uniform gekauft und werde jetzt neben filterkaffee mal esspresso mit siebtr ger probieren,wa w re mit der option die mitgelieferten siebe der dedica unten aufzubohren oder abzus gen soda au dem doppelwand sieb ein einwand sieb wird jemand erfahrung damit gemacht,super video am ton k nnte man noch arbeiten habe mir die maschine besorgt nach einem vollautomat einer pad maschine und einer kapsel maschine der kaffee hat mir dort nicht mehr geschmeckt die ersten selbst gebr hten kaffees schmecken schon echt gut kein vergleich zu den senseo dingern etc macht auch spa,kleber 99percent isopropyl geht leicht,der witz mit der stiftung warentest war gut,welchen kaffee habt ihr in diesem video verwendet,bin kurz davor mir so eine maschine zu zulegen trinke am liebsten espresso ab und an mal einen cappuccino finde die siebtr ger spannend m chte allerdings nicht mehr al 300euro ausgeben soll ich diese delonghi kaufen oder k nnt ihr etwas anderes empfehlen,danke f r da video ich habe die gleiche espresso maschine von einen freund f r 60euros bekommen ich bin kompletter neueinsteiger in sachen espresso habe keine bedinugsanleitung dazu bekommen k nnt ihr mir helfen benutze den lavazza espresso finde der passt sehr gut welchen w rdet ihr mir empfehlen,bedienungsanleitung gibts nat rlich bei de longhi,vielen dank hat mir weitergeholfen,welche kaffeem hle verwendest du denn,leute wieso ist euer sound immer noch so schrecklich,kaffeemacher ist ja nicht so das ihr nachher nicht auch noch video mit schlechtem sound gemacht habt,schaut im nov 2020 ein video vom sept 2019 und wundert sich das der sound noch so schlecht ist,ich w rde mich noch einmal sehr daf r interessieren ob e m glich ist mit dieser maschine auch einen vern nftigen caf creme zu beziehen wenn ja wie mus hier da verh ltnis von gramm pulver zu gramm erzeugtem caf sein und wie lang ist die daf r klassische extraktionszeit vielen dank f r da sehr informative video und nat rlich eure hilfe oder die der community,wenn dann mit einwandigem sieb,danke,wa haltet ihr davon eure video in kapitel einzuteilen eure video sind recht lang und e w re manchmal hilfreich direkt zu einem bestimmten punkt springen zu k nnen danke,liebe kaffeemacher und die profis unter euch vielen dank erstmal f r die vielen informativen video ich bin auf der suche nach einer neuen kaffeemaschine und absoluter neuling unter den siebtr gern kurze frage eher die de longhi dedica mit beispielsweise sage smartgrinder oder direkt die kombi de longhi specialista wie gesagt pure anf ngerin die auf der suche nach nem machbaren espresso f r zu hause ist w re super wenn ihr mir helfen k nntet vielen dank,will meine freundin zu weihnachten mit der dedica berraschen gibt e den preislich eine passende m hle dazu,diese maschine hatte ich auch f r da geld war die wirklich spitze,leider ist die de longhi auf dauer nix f ngt an zu tropfen und irgendwann nach 3 jahren hatte die pumpe aussetzer wa mich dann dazu bewogen hat mich davon zu trennen,super video kleiner tipp f r aufkleber r ckst nde zitronen l z b 1 2 tropfen und man kommt ewig au,de longhi sind nach meiner erfahrung klasse maschinen f r otto normalb rger sie halten auch jahrelang jederzeit wieder,e ist okay,tolles video ich bin seit 3 jahren von der maschine begeistert da sie mir f r meinen t glichen latte ma ausreicht auch habe ich schon einige mod verbaut ist e glich das ihr die gaggia new classic 2018 testet,lustigerweise steht die heute auf dem tisch,super video habe mir vor einer woche eine delonghi dedica ec 685 gekauft nun wei ich auch wie damit umzugehen waren doch einige gute tipps dabei wie andere schon geschrieben haben an der akkustik im raum k nntet ihr noch bisschen wa machen,elaine fillname nein dann werde ich gesteinigt ich werde da noch aufr sten,darf ich fragen welche kaffeem hle und welchen tamper du verwendest,danke dir wir sind st ndig dran zu versuchen die akustik zu verbessern da video ist mittlerweile auch schon ein jahr alt seit dem ist viel passiert,hallo ihr lieben danke f r eure video die sind wirklich hilfreich wir haben un gerade die delonghi zugelegt nur wir haben folgendes problem bei 13g kaffee die m hle ebenfalls von delongih steht schon auf dem feinsten mahlgrad halten wir 25 sek gedr ckt f r mich hei t e dann auch 25 sek extraktion oder ist da falsch kommen wir auf ca 50g getr nkemenge selbst wenn wir 1 3 ansetzten w rden ist der ertrag laut formel zu hoch vielleicht habe ich auch wa falsch verstanden bin um eure hilfe sehr dankbar ich verzweifel langsam,deiner pr zisen beschreibung entnehmen wir das du alles richtig machst aber deine m hle nicht fein genug mahlt rgerlich evtl gibt e die m glichkeit die grundeinstellung der m hle feiner zu stellen analog,testet doch bitte mal die la specialista von de longhi w rde mich sehr interessieren wa ihr noch au ihr rausholt,w rde mich auch interessieren,sehr ausf hrlich aber ich will doch nur kaffee trinken,da kann man mit der auch einfach zweimal wasser durch laufen lasse dann hast einen sch nen kaffee crema,ein 51er tamper passt perfekt rein die verkauft delonghi ja auch selbst 50er sind doch auch eher ungew hnlich,huhu kann jemand helfen wenn au einer nagelneuen maschine au dem dampfaufsatz nur wasser kommt wa l uft falsch ich hab schon ausprobiert da ganze bi zu einer minute laufen zu lassen aber e wird einfach kein dampf kaputt sein sollte sie ja nicht schon oder ich w r um antworten dankbar,super video danke f r die tipps,grandios sympathisch und vor allem sch n zu sehen das ihr bzgl neutraler bewertung voll durchgezogen habt double like von mir,also ich bekomme super schaum damit hin der auch perfekt steht,also ist latte macchiato m glich,genau da will man nicht zumindest f r latte art,ich habe da problem das meine delonghi ec 685 oft den bezug nach der preinfusion einfach abbricht ich brauche aber die menge und den mahlgrad f r eine vern nftige extraktionszeit gibt e da einen tipp oder mus ich mich damit abfinden dann einfach den mahlgrad ndern zu m ssen liegt vermute ich daran das der druck nicht ausreicht btw super video war bei mir kaufgrund f r meinen einstieg in die siebtr gerwelt,wa haltet ihr denn von der wmf lumero diese maschine habe ich n mlich f r 62euros geschossen,ich habe irgendwie nicht ganz verstanden ob ich durch bet tigen der kn pfe die kaffeemenge in der tasse oder die extrahierzeit einstelle kann mir bitte jemand helfen,nach 2 monaten d rfte die frage schon gel st sein die kn pfe kannst du hinsichtlich der wassermenge programmieren die dauer bi da wasser durchl uft h ngt vom mahlgrad ab,wa empfiehlt e sich bei der temperatur mittel oder hoch,im video wird hoch empfohlen bei dem verwendeten kaffee der namentlich nicht genannt wird,boah der fusselbart maaaan lass e doch einfach klebereste mit salat l wegrubbeln klappt quasi immer und die oberfl che von ger t und haut bleibt sch n,misst man die extraktionszeit ab druck auf kn pf oder ab flie en vom kaffee,und man stoppt wenn da maschinen brummen aufh rt oder wenn der kaffee nur noch tropft,k nntet ihr auch die ariete 1313 mal testen,k nnt ihr nicht mal etwas k rzere video machen ziemlich langatmig ich hab e mit doppelter geschwindigkeit laufen lassen interessant w re mal ein vergleich zwischen verschiedenen maschinen und ein ranking,ist doch super das e die schnelltaste gibt f r dich ist e schneller f r die vielen die lange video sch tzen ist e lang wir berlegen aber ob wir noch mal zusammenfassungen machen,vielen dank f r da video ich habe noch schwierigkeiten den milchschaum gut hinzubekommen ich f nde e mega wenn ihr noch mal in einem video genauer zeigen und erkl ren k nntet wie man mit der maschinen einen halbwegs vern nftigen milchschaum hinbekommt also wie lange wie tief oder schr g eintauchen etc,mittlerweile aug 2020 passt ein 51er tamper top video,wa f r ne tamper matte habt ihr den liebe gr e,hier wird nichts ber die langzeit nutzung der maschine gesagt denn bereits nach 6 monaten ist der druck quasi nicht mehr vorhanden dementsprechend niemals kaufempfehlung,w rde mich auch interessieren wie denn die dauerhaltbarkeit ist die schlechten rezensionen auf a sind ja eher in der minderheit bei der gt 10000 bewertungen trotzdem bleibt ein fader beigeschmack,e gibt einen bodenlosen siebtr ger zu kaufen der perfekt passt der hat sogar bereits ein sieb dabei in da ca 17 gramm kaffee passen kintrade kaffee bottomless portafilter 51mm f r delonghi ec680 ec685 edelstahl,margret schuchardt gl ck gehabt ich hab auch einen der perfekt passt allerdings habe ich die maschine zur ckgegeben da mir der damit zubereitete kaffee nicht geschmeckt hat,mikethespike meiner passt allerdings perfekt ich nutze ihn jetzt bereits seit 10 monaten ohne probleme,hast aber schon die rezensionen gelesen oder,can someone translate if the other guy liked the taste,both boy liked the coffee taste,tipp orangen l f r da entfernen der stickerr ckst nde verwenden,feuerzeugbenzin geht auch,normales brat l geht auch,w rde isopropanol alkohol empfehlen wenn auch orangen l sicher besser riecht,mein leben lang kein orangen l gesehen bzw gebraucht,danke f r da hilfreiche infovideo wa die kleber ckst nde angeht solltet ihr mal nagellackentferner ausprobieren d rfte echtem edelstahl nichts ausmachen lg,hallo wenn ich 4 oder 6 caff machen will mus ich immer die maschine au machen zwischen jeder 2caffe,hallo zusammen bin richtig gl cklich mit der maschine ich wei leider nicht wie da entkalken geht und wa ich f r einen entkalker nehmen soll beim letzten mal blinkte die rechte taste orange auf aufsch umd se und ab und da bekomme ich nicht weg e st rt mich auch weil ich da blinken sehe sobald ich sie einschalte ich habe nach anweisung entkalkt e ist bereits einer in der verpackung gewesen und e blinkt leider trotzdem weiterhin jetzt w nsche ich euch allen einen sch nen sonntag und liebe gr e au oberschwaben,ggf da entkalkungsprogramm nicht vollst ndig beendet 2 durchlauf grunds tzlich geht die blinkende taste im anschluss daran au,tolles und informatives video mein linkes ohr dankt euch,finde e echt gut wie ihr da macht man findet bei euch von bi und nicht nur sehr teure sachen schlussendlich kommt e auf da erreichbare ergebnis mit dem vorhanden werkzeug an allein da ambiano tuning mega interessieren w rde mich noch die m hle au dem set von der dedica ich habe zwar f r filterkaffee eine baratza encore die auch recht fein mahlen kann aber eine zweite m hle kann nicht schaden gleiches design macht sich nat rlich gut nebeneinander daf r mus da mahlergebnis aber auch gut sein sch ne gr e,wie w re e mit einem test dieser g nstigen maschine der druckmesser h tte wa severin espresa plus ka 5995,kleber r ckst nde entfernt man mit l nicht mit geschirrsp lmittel oder glasreiniger,ich finde sie ist schwer und nicht leicht,evtl bl de frage aber kann man mit der maschine auch normalen kaffee machen mus dazu sagen da ich mich nicht auskenne w re f r kaffee evtl eher die delonghi la specialista zu empfehlen,warum zeigt ihr nie den mahlgrad wie die fausto eingestellt ist,weil e zu fehlern verleitet,gilt die br hzeit schon aber der vorbr hung,eig ab dem zeitpunkt wo der erste tropfen kommt,k nnt ihr die quickmill orione 3000 oder cassiopea genauer unter die lupe nehmen das w re super genial liebe gr sse,hey danke f r da klasse video k nntet ihr mir einen tipp geben wie ich mit der maschine einen leckeren normalen kaffee bekomme meiner ist meistens zu d nn selbst wenn ich da gro e sieb zwei mal neu bef lle,001vendetta ah gut die dedica hat ja die funktion solange wasser laufen zu lassen wie man auf den entsprechenden ausgabeknopf dr ckt um die wassermenge zu speichern vielleicht klappt ja dann die von den kaffeemachern beschriebene methode einen cafe crema zu produzieren dummerweise kann man sich echt viel mit espresso und dieser maschine auseinandersetzen d siehe da tuningvideo der kaffeemacher zu dieser maschine oder da kaffee netz forum,phoenix0i4 hey danke f r die antwort ja da video hatte ich wenig sp ter gesehen e ist eher der cafe crema den ich versuche mit der maschine hinzubekommen ich werde auf jeden fall versuchen den kaffee zuk nftig abzuwiegen um ein optimales verh ltnis zu bekommen,da ist eine espresso maschine die macht standardm ig keinen normalen filterkaffee wa du vielleicht suchst ist ein cafe americano dazu einen einfachen oder doppelten espresso mit hei em wasser auff llen ist halt geschmackssache in welchem verh ltnis espresso und wasser stehen soll e gibt sogar von den jung hier ein video dazu,bin gerade durch zufall auf die kaffeemacher gestossen und fand eure test zur aldi und delonghi dedica maschine erfrischend mein fazit wer sich m he gibt kann auch au g nstigen maschinen guten espresso zaubern nur weil man ne la marzocco hat heisst da noch lange nicht das dann der espresso auch automatisch spitze wird wie sch tzt ihr nach solchen testergebnissen den anteil der m hle und der bohnen an der qualit t de resultierenden espresso ein,danke f r die hervorragenden video und testberichte ein super kanal wa w re eurer meinung nach die bessere wahl die sage barista pro oder diese delonghi plus eine m hle,habt ihr spiritus oder entsprechenden glasreiniger versucht um den rest de aufklebers zu entfernen,also ich habe diese delongi ec 685 und ich mus sagen da ich seid ich euch verfolge mit diesen video da mein kaffee deutlich besser geworden danke an euch beiden da ihr diese video macht ihr habt mir sehr geholfen ihr seid super,danke euch ich habe auf euch geh rt und fange erstmal mit einer sette 270 und dieser maschiene an mehr ist gerade nicht drinn wenn ihr noch mal ein sieb findet w re da super da empfohlene ist nicht mehr zu bekommen danke p noch ein wa kauft man eigentlich f r tassen,da sieb von graef gibt e wieder bei amazon,ich suche zu dieser maschine eine passende m hle wa w re eure empfehlung,elaine fillname ich wei e ist schon komisch eine m hle zu kaufen die hnlich so teuer wie die maschine an sich ist jedoch ist der mahlgrad eine der gr ten fehlerquelle und super wichtig e ist ein zusammenspiel au beidem ohne vern nftige m hle bekommst du selbst au einer 1000euros maschine keinen tollen espresso bzw nur mit gl ck und oder viel m he da mus ich aktuell auch leider festellen umgekehrt siehst du aber auch hier mit einer der g nstigsten maschinen bekommst du ein vern nftiges ergebnis solange der mahlgrad richtig eingestellt ist,elaine fillname da ist die g nstigste und bekannte,kaffeemacher und wa w re die g nstigste variante die da noch halbwegs angemessen hinbekommt,sage smart grinder pro,ich wette da der caff au meiner unter 100e maschine die ich alle paar jahre gebraucht f r 15 20e kaufe genauso gut ist wie au euren prestige maschinen e kommt n mlich wie so oft weniger auf is ger t al auf den bediener desselben an f r diesen hier mich mu die maschine auch nicht zentnerschwer sein ich habe noch zwei arme und kann sie festhalten und chrom verbessert den geschmack auch nicht aber so gut wie eine teure ist sie nat rlich trotzdem nicht f r is bruttosozialprodukt,warum soll da auch nicht ok sein ihr seid so verwundert e ist doch immer der selbe prozess in der extraktion unterschied ist nur die bohne die leichte temperaturschwankung und die extraktionszeit und nat rlich edelstahl v plastik ganz ehrlich f r jemanden der sich mal schnell einen hochwertigen kaffee machen will ist da doch v llig egal in professioneller umgebung geht sowas nicht aber die barista community mus langsam einsehen das die meisten leute keinen anspruch auf gro e einstellungsschwankungen haben,hallo ich habe auch die dedica und mus sagen da der kaffee nur warm rauskommt bin etwas entt uscht aber wom glich mache ich wa falsch mfg fabio,leon fretter danke da hilft aber leider nicht wirklich mus wohl die tassen weiter vorw rmen,du kannst die wasser temperatur zumindest ein bisschen einstellen zw 3 stufen ausw hlen,hi wird die extraktionszeit hier ab dem dr cken de knopfes gemessen oder erst ab dem zeitpunkt wo da wasser nach der vorbr hung zum laufen beginnt stelle ich die wassermenge mit kaffeepulver im siebtr ger ein,verwendet terpentin zum abl sen vom kleber,hier mein feedback nach den vielen lobeshymnen habe ich mir diese expressomaschine gekauft und mus gleich dazusagen das ich ein blutiger anf nger bin aber nach all den ermutigenden video und kommentaren dachte ich e wird schon gut gehen nach etlichen versuchen und herumprobieren ist mein fazit wie folgt sicher bin ich selbst schuld wenn da ergebnis nicht gut ist aber ich bin halt auch kein experte und diese maschine ist ja wohl f r otto normalverbraucher gedacht e gibt so viele dinge die man falsch machen kann ist der kaffee zu fein gemahlen wird er schlecht ist der kaffee zu grob gemahlen wird er schlecht hat man zu viel getampert wird er schlecht hat man zu wenig getampert wird er schlecht hat man ein gramm zu viel oder zu wenig genommen wird er auch schlecht etc etc von 10 versuchen ist vielleicht einer f r meinen bescheidenden geschmack brauchbar gewesen vom aufsch umen ganz zu schweigen ich hab mir vorher zig video dar ber angeschaut aber nicht einmal hat e bei mir ann hernd geklappt zu fl ssig zu viele blasen unten dick oben d nn usw fazit ich geb e auf und mache wieder kapsel kaffee m gen die kaffee p pste auch die nase r mpfen und wa war da ganz am schluss selbst mit der maschine kannst du keinen guten expresso machen war da ein wink mit dem zaunpfahl,vielleicht hat sich die maschine auch gew hrt weil du e x presso machen wolltest aber mal im ernst ja e braucht bung und viel konsistenz toi toi toi,danke f r video wie kriege ich die optimale einstellung brew ratio mit dem einersieb hin hat da wer tipps danke,ber den mahlgrad bei gleicher kaffeepulvermenge einer sieb ca 11 bi 12g bei eher etwas dunkleren r stung,k nnt ihr verraten welchen kaffee ihr benutzt habt und welchen mahlgrad,da kann man leider nicht bertragen,hallo liebes kaffeemacher team wenn ich jetzt mit dieser maschine einsteigen m chte in die welt der siebtr ger nat rlich mit neuem sieb welche m hle w re dann eure empfehlung f r mich liebe gr e au stuttgart,mit wd40 gehen die kleberr ckst nde her bissl wa auf ein tuch und rubbeln,auf euren tip hin hab ich mir die maschine gekauft leider krieg ich weder espresso und schon gar keinen kaffee hin am besten gehts noch mit ich wei ganz gro e sakrileg vorgemahlenem espresso au dem supermarkt doch auch da wird jeder bezug anders trotz beachtung aller channeling tip abwiegen de kaffeepulvers etc mit selbst gemahlenem kaffee sage smart grinder pro frisch vom r ster gehts gar nicht da kommt nur ungenie bare essigbr he heraus ganz egal wa man am mahlgrad einstellt leider sind die von euch empfohlenen sage pro siebe aktuell nirgends zu bekommen und mit dem werksseitig beigelegten equipment krieg ich jedenfalls berhaupt nichts hin da ganze entwickelt sich zu einem zeit und geld raubenden nervenkrieg und ist weit entfernt von einem guten t sschen kaffee zur entspannung man hat die ganze arbeitsplatte voll ger tschaften m hle siebtr ger waage me gef e tamper etc berall kaffeepulver nach jedem bezug eine reinigunsorgie und v llig sauber kriegt man den auslass ohnehin nicht egal wie man putzt und da ding auch auf den kopf setllt e h ngt immer noch alter kaffee irgendwo drin den man nicht rauskriegt jedoch beim n chsten leerlauf zum anw rmen im leeren siebtr ger hat wie ich da morgen schnell meine zwei k beltassen voll leckerem cremakaffe rauskriegen soll ist mir v llig schleierhaft ich will meine alte petra padmaschine sie ruhe nach fast 20 jahren treuer dienste in frieden zur ck kann man mit dem ding berhaupt normalen crema kaffee machen oder nur hom ophatische espressomengen und wie kriegt man wenigsten die mit dem originalzubeh r hin kann e sein das da ganze thema siebtr ger nur f r masochistisch veranlagte zeitgenossen mit zuviel zeit und geld geeignet ist,probier e mal mit orangen l so bekommst du die klebereste weg super video ich habe mir die maschine letztens gekauft,mir ist der doppelte ein bisschen zu viel kaffee koffein wie w ren die parameter f r einen kleinen 7g kaffee menge in ml extraktionszeit danke,jakob89 herzlichen dank f r deine antwort ungef hr so habe ich da auch gemacht dann betr gt dir extraktionszeit aber nur ca 10 alle angaben die ich bisher fand gaben ca 25 extraktionszeit vor meine eigentliche frage ist also ob ich irgendwie daf r sorgen mus das der kaffee auch bei 7g 25 rausl uft oder ob da dann k rzer sein darf,kannste doch selbst ausrechnen brew ratio 1 2 5 dh 7x2 5 entspricht dann 17 5g bzw in der tasse dann ml schnelles umrechnen f r k chenzutaten um die ma einheiten von wasser umzurechnen brauchst du gar nichts zu tun ein milliliter wasser hat genau einen gramm masse via google extraktionszeit misst du dann einfach mit dem iphone vorausgesetz deine waage hat keinen timer wichtig ist das soviel wasser durchl uft bi in deiner tasse 17 5g drinnen sind und dann nicht vergessen den timer zu stoppen dann hast du deine antwort,al laie und einsteiger ist da video wirklich sehr hilfreich leider gibt e in kombination mit der h ufig im bundle angebotenen m hle delonghi kg521 folgendes problem folgt man der video empfehlung von 13 g pulver und einer endmenge von ca 33 g kann die extraktion maximal auf 14 16 sekunden gedehnt werden dy f hrt leider zu einer sehr sauren note einzige nachvollziehbare erkl rung w re die zu grobe mahlung trotz einstellung in der feinsten stufe kennt jemand da gleiche problem bzw kann sich einen reim drauf machen,die m hle kann leider nicht fein genug mahlen hatte da gleiche problem und un die m hle getauscht,kann ich mir kaum vorstellen du kannst doch auf der 2tassentaste so lange gedr ckt halten bi du deine 33g voll hast und dann loslassen dann ist die eingespeichert wenn du die 33g jetzt schon in 14 16 sek voll hast dann denke ich auch kann e nur am mahlgrad liegen und am verdichten,ich hab diese maschine jetzt seit ner woche und ich mus wirklich sagen ich bin sowas von zufrieden ich bin espressoanf nger daf r finde ich al laie bekomme ich dadurch einen wirklich relativ guten espresso hin ich habe die ersten tage mit der werksteinstellung gearbeitet da ich ja keinen vergleich habe heute habe ich mich getraut die menge abzuwiegen und versucht in der brewratio von 1 2 5 zu kommen ist nich einfach bei dem doppelwandigen boden aber machbar hier habe ich gemerkt hey der schmeckt wirklich besser und da habe ich echt den spa dran gewonnen ich habe al m hle die baratze encore berall lese ich sie sei f r espresso nicht gemacht da kann ich nicht best tigen ich habe schon oft in pizzerien bei leuten mit teuren siebtr gern oder bei vollautomaten espresso getrunken ich habe auch mal in einem cafe gearbeitet und ich mus sagen mti der baratza encore im zusammenspiel mit der delonghi dedica bekommt man einen wirklich guten espresso hin ich habe mir einen extra bodenlosen siebtr ger mal bestellt mit normalen sieb bekomme e nicht bers herz da zu zers gen und werde damit auch rumprobieren aber trotz doppeltem boden und einer angeblich zu groben baratza encore m hle habe ich f r mich pers nlich und meine freundin wirklich absolut zufriedenstellende ergebnisse erzielt klar ich habe keine erfahrung mit 1000 euro m hle und 1000euro siebtr ger aber da sind f r mich auch preise die f r mich einfach berhaupt nicht im verh ltnis stehen kurzum e ist eine wirkklich super einsteigermaschine die man absolut empfehlen kann e wird nich perfekt aber e wird richtig gut ich bin zufrieden und dank eurem und coffeeness video habe ich viel mit der mschine arbeiten k nnen,reabal alhadidi ja sie funktioniert noch,hallo wenn ich sie mal fragen kann ist die maschine noch funktioniert einwandfrei,diesis begeisterte gesicht nach dem milchsch umen hat mir direkt gute laune besorgt,coole video aber wenn ich bei mir 13g pulver in den siebtr ger mache ist viel weniger drin warum,cool danke f r die antwort welche kaffeebohnen werden empfohlen,hell ger steter kaffee,ich m chte sehr gerne mit dem erlernen von latte art beginnen allerdings bin ich aktuell knapp bei kasse und kann mir keine teure espressomaschine leisten ich besitze einen c40 commandante grinder und k nnte somit zumindest so eine gute mahlung garantieren reicht die maschine um in da thema latte art einzusteigen ich w rde mich sehr ber eure r ckmeldung freuen,kaffeemacher danke euch f r die schnelle antwort,auf jeden fall da geht viel spa bei deinem lernweg,hey jung gro artiges video ich habe mir tat chlich die dedeca gekauft auf euren kanal bin ich dann allerdings nach dem kauf gesto en ihr habt vollkommen recht man mus zwischen ger ten f r den pro f r den passionierten privaten gastgeber und dem einsteiger unterscheiden ein passionierter moutainbikefahrer schl gt vielleicht auch die h nde ber den kopf zusammen wenn jemand ein mtb f r unter 2 000 euro kaufen m chte kostet doch schon die federgabel 1 500euros letztlich wird aber da rennen nicht am material entschieden die dedeca bietet mir al absoluten einsteiger und vor dem schauen eurer video hatte ich berhaupt keine ahnung erste tolle zubereitungserfolge nach diesem video habe ich mit mahlgrad extraktionszeit kaffemenge und ausgabemenge herumexperimentiert meinen geschmack trifft e nun am besten bei einem br h verh ltnis von etwa 1 2 7 vermutlich schmeckt e mit einen super kaffee nochmal besser den hack mit dem anderen sieb werde ich auch umsetzen die anderen drei nicht so reversiblen hack vielleicht erst nach ablauf der garantiezeit da erste kleine herz wurde auch schon geschafft hier gebe ich michel recht das e unfassbar viel bung bedarf 20 30 tassen brauche ich vielleicht noch bi e mir noch besser gelingt jedenfalls vielen dank f r da wirklich gute video und den super vortragsstil da ist kurzweilig und macht spa,hallo zusammen wir hier sind absolute anf nger und haben un diese de longi gekauft in diesem video zeigt ihr da man 13 gramm kaffe in den siebtr ger bekommt bei un irgendwie unm glich dann bekommen wir den siebtr ger an der maschine nicht mehr zu woran kann da liegen ok wir haben noch keinen guten temper sondern nur den der bei der maschine dabei war k nnte e daran liegen gewogen haben wir mit einer k chenwaage k nnte sein da die nicht richtig abwiegt wir nutzen den einsatz im siebtr ger mit den zwei l ffeln in dem einsatz ist nochmal ein kleiner sieb mit gummiumrandung sollten wir den rausnehmen da wir die 13 gramm untergekommen gr e und ber eine antwort w rden wir un freuen,k nnt ihr mal die billigmaschine vom aldi antesten ich kann mir nicht vorstellen das die wa kann,i wish there were english sub in this good vdo,habe mir diese maschine gekauft und wie im video beschrieben eingestellt hat super viel spa gemacht und schmeckt f r mich kaffee laien sehr gut vielen dank f r is zeigen,welche kaffeem hle verwendest du denn,ich saug eure video gerade auf wie ein schwamm vielen dank f r da know how hat meine sicht auf kaffee komplett gepr gt und da interesse daf r geweckt da kommentar bezieht sich auf die bisher gesehen video nicht nur auf diesis macht weiter so ihr habt deutlich mehr like und subscriber verdient,kurze frage z hlt man bei der maschine die vorbr hzeit zu der extraktionszeit also den 25 sekunden dazu,hier findest du die antwort,test hallo hallo 1 2 3 test kommen die kommdntare fragen durch,kaffeemacher achsoo ok dachte irgendwie technisches problem oder so gruess,wie erhalten zahlreiche kommentare auf allen kan len e mail wir schaffen e nicht alle individuell zu beantworten einmal pro woche beantworten wir viele live am donnerstag um 17 30 auch heute haben wir so wieder viele beantwortet,danke f r da gute video und die hilfreichen tipps probier gleich mal da sch uen au super wie ihr r ber kommt nat rlich und nicht so youtube steif verklemmt wie viele andere,informativ aber zu langatmig da ganze h tte man auch in 15 minuten aussagen k nnen,genau infogehalt sehr gut aber zu langf dig in der k rze liegt die w rze,hello jung top arbeit im stiftungwarentest urteil fliesst halt auch der preis mit hinein deshalb relativiert sich diesis urteil der delonghi themawechsel ich lese h ufig von den lelit maschinen pl41 pl42 em temd modelle letztere hat die m hle mit an bord die meisten meinungen sind sehr gut und sowie preislich wie auch vom erscheinungsbild sehr ansprechend kennt ihr die lelit k nnt ihr wa erz hlen lg,hallo liebe kaffemacher ich habe mal eine frage wa haltet ihr von der solis espressomaschine mit manometer dampf und hei wasserfunktion pid temperaturregler 54 mm siebtr ger mit doppelauslauf 15 bar 1 7 l wassertank edelstahl barista perfetta plus typ 1170 f r 424 euro diese w rde ich sp ter gerne im wohnmobil verwenden ist die qualitativ besser al die delonghi dedica 685 vielen dank,,e kam wie e kommen musste jetzt habe ich die delonghi ec685 mit den gr f sieben einwandig und meine bisher wirklich sehr nette kaffee m hle wilfa svart kommt nat rlich nicht an die feinheit de espressopulvers so fast h tte ich mir die graef ding 800 gekauft und zack entdeckte ich euer testvideo dazu ui auf sooo viel totraum hab ich null lust shit wa nun ich fand keine alternative m hle in eurem kanal habt ihr eine info zu einer anderen m hle die mich nicht in den endg ltig finanziellen ruin treibt aber die mir bitte jetzt mal crema macht bohnen habe ich drauf geachtet das sie neu sind also mus eine feinere m hle her bei der ich bitte nicht st ndig auseinanderbauen mus um tonnen von mehl da raus zu holen bitte ich bin f r jeden hinweis dankbar auch gerne unter 230 euro,k nnt ihr mal die delonghi la specialista testen danke,frage passt der siebtr ger f r kapseleins tze graef 146506 in die delonghi,dedica ec685 v sage ses810 wa w rdet ihr bevorzugen und warum,18 05,hallo frage an die profis ich trinke gerne normalen kaffee filterkaffee oder kaffee au vollautomaten mit dieser maschine k nnte man ja einen caf americano machen wie ist eure meinung zu diesem thema geschmacksunterschied caf americano v caf regular filter kaffee danke im voraus,kaffeemacher akademie amp r sterei super danke f r die schnelle r ckmeldung wo w rdet ihr kaffee au einem mokka beh lter sehen danke,du kannst gleichm iger extrahieren wenn du einen filterkaffee machst die st rke ist aber geringer al bei einem americano lungo cafe natur wir machen dazu mal ein video,so nach diversen test gebe ich euch recht die maschine insbesondere in kombination mit der graef cm800 bietet zu wenig kontrolle man kann keine konsistenz erreichen die justierung an der graef korreliert nicht ausreichend mit der durchlaufzeit bei der dedica 685 f r meinen geschmack erreicht der espresso auch nicht die notwendige temperatur er bleibt sauer und ist einfach nicht rund ich w rde al fazit von einem absoluten fehlkauf sprechen,mit der 2 tassentasse und dem 2er sieb komme ich zwar auf ca 25 sekunden laufzeit aber in der tasse enden ca 70 gramm wie soll ich da auf die h lfte 30 gramm k rzen und dabei die laufzeit halten nutze die graef cm 800 mit einer 11er einstellung und einen normierten tamper mit ca 14 kilo anpressdruck viel feiner l sst sich da espressomehl nicht gewinnen mein espresso schmeckt zur zeit auch etwas s uerlich crema ist sichtbar,denke mal die jung haben da so eingestellt das sie ganz fein gemahlenen kaffe nehmen und dann auf 13g im siebtr ger auff llen soda letztlich bei der 2 tassen taste und einer laufzeit von ca 25 sek bei denen ungef hr 32g in der tasse landen wa schon eine etwas dichtere masse zu sein scheint bei mir landen auch aktuell ca 66g in der tasse,da einstellen der temperatur war schon eine herausforderung der hersteller h tt e nicht komlizierter machen k nnen die wassermengeeinstellung noch nicht gefunden danke super tolles video,beim bezug so lange auf die einer oder zweierportion dr cken bi die gew nschte wassermenge erreicht ist danach ist die wassermenge gespeichert,kleine frage zur wassermenge erstmal cooles gelungenes video du sagst 13g kaffee pulver und da 2 5 fache an wasser programmierst du die ca 32g bei leerem sieb oder 32 g fertiger espresso,nachdem ich mir auch die frage gestellt und recherchiert habe beschreibt die brew ratio da verh ltnis eingesetzter kaffee zum eingesetztem wasser speziell beim espresso allerdings wird dy anscheinend anders interpretiert gehandhabt mit dem verh ltnis eingesetzter kaffee zum kaffee output fertiger espresso somit w re 32gr fertiger espresso die antwort auf deine frage,kann mir jemand helfen nach dem aufsch umen der milch f ge ich den milschschaum in die tasse der legt sich aber direkt obendrauf und nicht wie bei allen anderen al erstes unter den expresso e nicht m glich wa sch ne zu zaubern wa mache ich bitte falsch hat jemand einen tipp,poison85,kaffeemacher wooow danke f r die mega schnelle antwort k nnt ihr da mal ein video von machen w re bestimmt interessant auch f r viele andere anf nger lg,zu viel volumen zu lange ziehphase die verk rzen und mehr rollen,hallo jung finde da ganz witzig eigentlich bin ich auf der suche nach einem espressokocher oder wie man e auch bezeichnen mag und dadurch bin ich irgendwie auf euren kanal gesto en ich bin n mlich berhaupt keine kaffeetrinkerin sondern trinke mal einen milchkaffee oder latte macchiato und da auch nur gelegentlich aber jetzt bin ich am berlegen mir die de longhi zu kaufen f r mich al gelegenheitstrinker optimal 1 platzsparend da kleine k che 2 zum kleinen preis und 3 hat einen milchaufsch umer dann noch da super aufkl rende video zur maschine einfach perfecto schon einiges gelernt w re prima wenn ihr mal die klarstein bella vita espresso 1575 w testen k nntet um zu schauen welche besser abschneidet danke daf r grazie mille,hallo ihr lieben danke f r da coole video auf das ich durch arne von coffeeness aufmerksam wurde ich selbst nutze die dedica wie auch bereits da vorg ngermodel e gibt ein thema da bin ich st ndig am experimentiere da ist wie bekomme ich einen anst ndigen caffee crema mit der maschine hin welche bohnensorte espressobohnen oder cremabohnen pulvermenge und malgrad ich habe eine graef cm800 wassermenge f r eine gro e tasse kaffee verh ltnis pulver wassermenge hei e wasser zu gie en oder nicht habt ihr hier den ultimativen tipp oder zumindest wie w rdet ihrs machen herzliche gru christian,bei 13g und tamper kommt bei mir fast oder gar kein wasser mehr durch espresso schmeckt dann auch immer total s uerlich kann jemand der auf einwandige siebe gewechselt hat sagen ob da damit besser wird komische ist mit normalen kaffee bohnen funktioniert e bei gleichem mahlgrad und der espresso schmeckt dann auch viel harmonischer,habe mir da video angeguckt nachdem ich die maschine gekauft habe d hatte aber zuvor da erw hnte video von coffeeness gesehen und auch den test von stiftung warentest danke f r euer video ja der ton k nnt optimiert werden die info sind aber klasse ich bin der meinung das die maschine einen wirklich guten job macht gut ihr al kaffee experten stuft sie al ok ein ich w rde ein gut abgeben preis leistung ist hier wirklich top maschinen ber 1000 euro kann sich nicht jeder leisten achja der aufkleber von stiftung warentest ist zum gl ck nicht mehr auf die maschine geklebt,misst man die extraktionszeit bei der marschiene oder generell wenn man auf den knopf f r den shot dr ckt oder erst wenn kaffee au dem siebtr ger kommt und sollte die extraktionszeit generell bei 25 sec liegen oder h ngt da auch von der menge de kaffees ab,tat chlich ne frage die mich auch besch ftigt ich denke z hlen tut eher die menge die nach der extraktion auch unten herauskommt ich tu mich etwas schwer da eine waage drunter zu bekommen,leute ich hab mir viele berichte angesehen und wie einige hier auch bemerkt haben kann man diese maschine ganz einfach modifizieren und somit da ergebnis wahrscheinlich stark verbessern man ben tigt dazu 51mm non pressurized basket filter und die dampfh lse der dampflanze zieht man ab da man somit wohl einen besseren milchschaum erzeugen kann ich hab die maschine bestellt und direkt auf anhieb die modifikationen umgesetzt und siehe da mir schmeckt e und ich denke da ergebnis ist wirklich top f r diesen preis 129 euro auf amazon 51mm tamper passt perfekt kann ich best tigen laut einem kommentar hier ist der 50er tamper zu klein,ahoi jung vielen dank f r da informative video welches ja weit mehr liefert al nur einen testbericht habe sofort euren kanal abonniert brigens harte klebereste entferne ich ganz gut mit orangen l weiter so joe,kaffeemacher kann ich bei der delonghi dedica auch einfach einen langen kaffee beziehen also da wasser einfach solange laufen lassen bi eine normale tasse voll ist,oder wd 40 da hilft immer,danke dir,legend r ist der leimr ckstand auf der maschine vom stiftung warentest kleber wie doof ist da denn habe gestern eine maschine gekauft mich ordentlich ber den kleber ge rgert und schlussendlich kommt bei meiner nix raus auch ohne andr cken de kaffeepulvers tropfen nur einzelne tropfen raus beim heisswasser tropfts auch nur mus am montag zur ck zu mediamarkt,ich selbst bereite seit 2 jahren meinen cappuccino mit einem klarstein siebtr ger f r 86 euro passionata 15 zu und die maschine macht wunderbaren espresso auch da milchaufsch umen klappt damit wunderbar gerade mit solchen absoluten low budget maschinen kann man wunderbar in die siebtr ger einsteigen und kosteng nstig damit rum experimentieren,hartn ckige klebereste silikonentferner sollte da erledigen aber ziemlich wild da zeugs deswegen geignete schutzmassnahmen treffen,hab die 685bk vorher die 680 und bin absolut zufrieden ihr best tigt meine erfahrungen zu 100percent f r den preis vollkommen okay und jung arbeitet am ton bitte,welche kaffeem hle verwendest du denn,w rde mich ber einen test der delonghi la specialista freuen,danke f r da tolle video hab mal ne frage wenn ich die br hzeit bei dieser maschine einstelle z hlt dann da vorbr hen schon mit oder stoppe ich die zeit erst wenn die eigentliche extraktion beginnt macht immerhin 6 7sek unterschied und ich kann al einsteiger nicht unbedingt erkennen ob ich l nger oder k rzer beziehen mus ich schau aktuell einfach das ich auf um die 25sek komme,die videoqualit t ist sehr gut nur der ton ist furchtbar deine schreibt da andere fl stert der n chste nuschelt punkt h rt ihr eigentlich eure eigene video mal ab oder ist da alles nur frei schnauze so kann man kein video schauen wieder auf dem fernseher noch mit kopfh rern,habe die maschine seit 1 jahr wegen immer wieder auftretender probleme bei den siebtr gereins tzen wurde die maschine miitlerweile mehrmals zur reparatur eingeschickt nach ca 20 eins tzen waren die siebe trotz reinigung nach jeder nutzung verstopft und e kam kein espresso durch den siebtr ger wa kann ich dagegen tun danke,vielen dank f r da tolle video geht die maschine bei euch auch in den langzeittest bei amazon schreiben so viele das die maschine nach einigen monaten keinen druck mehr aufbaut und dann lohnt sich e sich m glicherweise doch gleich mehr geld auszugeben,anna diehl geht mir hnlich ich schrecke auch vor den negativen rezensionen zur ck die ec860 hatte ich fr her auf der arbeit habe mich in die maschine verliebt berlege mir aber ob eine ec680 685 reicht ich denke da spielt vielleicht auch ein wenig gl ck mit wie lange die maschine h lt interessant w ren die unterschiede im innere aufbau der beiden genannten maschinen an welche alternativmaschine denkst du w re die ec860 wa f r dich,hallo zusammen k nnt ihr einen test ber die delonghi la specialista machen liebe gr sse,super video welches mir sehr geholfen hat also vielen dank daf r und vorallem auch daf r das ihr die maschine so ausf hrlich testet und vorstellt einzige negativ kritik die aussage mit dem durchmesser de tamper kann ich nicht nachvollziehen ein 51er tamper passt ohne zu murksen v llig problemlos und ich finde den 50er den ich extra wegen eures tipps bestellt habe deutlich zu klein aber ansonsten weiter so habe durch eure video endlich gelernt mit dem siebtr ger kaffee zu machen und verfolge den kanal gerne,mein 51er tamper von delonghi passt auch problemlos rein h tte mir auch fast einen anderen gekauft,danke dir ralf ich habe die maschine gestern bekommen und direkt einen 51er tamper mitbestellt weil ich deinen kommentar gelesen habe ich habe zu tzlich meinen siebtr ger modifiziert d h ich habe den kunststoffeinsatz in dem siebtr ger gek rzt damit ich einen 51mm non pressurized basket filter einsatz einsetzen kann um richtigen espresso zu br hen damit meine ich das ich keinen der mitgelieferten eins tze benutze da die ja nur ein loch haben um die crema k nstlich zu erzeugen ich hoffe ihr versteht wie da gemeint ist d gibt viele tutorial auf youtube man kann den siebtr ger auch so modifizieren das man eine naked extraction bottomless portafilter hinbekommt,ich war zu beginn sehr zufrieden allerdings ist die qualit t der maschine sehr minderwertig nach ca 1 jahr gingen die probleme los mit abbr chen beim br hen oder dampfgeben,gem amazon rezessionen ist da ein problem der elektronik und soll sich angeblich durch einen reset zu den werkseinstellungen beheben lassen,der ec 860 hat eine durchlaufet von nur 15 sek kann man da ndern,ich hab noch mokka pulver von illy schmeckt extrem lasch und berhaupt nicht kr ftig am liebsten m chte ich rostretro von nespresso mach ich wa falsch,recht herzlichen dank da waren genau die beschreibungen die al anf nger einsteiger ben tigt werden wir haben sehr viele video zu dieser maschine und dem milchsch umen angesehen ihre vorf hrung war die beste und ich kann so f r meine zuk nftigen bungen immer wieder nachschlagen besten dank abonniert und,die klebereste kann man schnell mit einem glasreiniger weg,wd40 geht vieeeeel besser,hallo vielen dank f r die tollen video ich habe die ec685 mit edelstahlsiebtr ger einwandigem graef sieb amp der ec800 schon de l ngerem bisher war ich soweit zufrieden nun interessiere ich mich aber f r die bezzera magica oder der rocket appartamento erstere bezzera magica habe ich schon etwas l nger im auge wa ist eure empfehlung vg,ich finde sie geil meine erste siebtr germaschine jetzt wo ich mir eine 200euros kaffeem hle gekauft habe schmeckt der cappuccino einfach ph nomenal,lieber benjamin da diese maschine bei freunden steht habe ich schon h ufig versucht damit da bestm gliche ergebnis zu erzeugen und da ich zuf llig ber da video gestolpert bin war ich gespannt zu welchem urteil ihr kommt ich habe ein paar mal festgestellt das die maschine nicht viel krafteinsatz beim tampen verzeiht h ufig lief dann da wasser auch zwischen dichtung und siebtr ger oben vorbei vielleicht stimmte aber auch der mahlgrad nicht oder die dichtungen sind nicht so optimal spannend w re ja jetzt ja im sinne der einsteigerlogik noch welche m hlen im segment interessant sind um ingesamt zu einem gut voll ok zu kommen liebe gr e david,bisschen shrimppulver in den espresso und nen teel ffel parmesan auf den milchschaum dann passt da,wie heiss sollte man die espressomaschine generell einstellen ist da geschmackssache oder darf der espresso generell nicht zu heiss sein,kommt auf da brew ratio und extraktion an,super video vielen dank,wie kann man da al gut bezeichnen l cherlich,welcher kaffee marke mahlgrad wurde verwendet bei mir l uft der kaffee mit 13g und festpressen nicht raus sondern tropft nur kann mir jemand weiterhelfen ansonsten top video,marcel kaltenh user da verr ckte ist mit normalen bohnen funzt e und schmeckt auch gut hole ich aber frische espresso bohnen beim r ster f r teures geld kommt kaum wa au der maschine und e schmeckt furchtbar und da bei gleicher menge und mahlgrad ich versteh e nicht,primeobjective also ich habe jetzt eine tchibo kaffee bei edeka gekauft und direkt die bohnen auf feinster stufe im laden gemahlen seitdem im doppelsieb 13g und fest trampern l uft und schmeckt e bestens,ist bei mir auch so kann kaum mit druck trampern auch schmeckt mein espresso immer s uerlich bin bissel am verzweifeln habe mir jetzt die einwendungen gr f siebe bestellt und hoffe e wird besser,ich hatte anfangs da gleiche problem denke mal e liegt an dem doppelwandigen sieb schau mal weiter oben bei den kommentaren da sind link zu den besseren sieben und einem anderen siebtr ger habe ich jetzt auch mal bestellt und hoffe da e dadurch besser wird,mich w rde auch mal interessieren wie die materialit t de siebtr gers ist,mus ich f r meinen perfekten espresso cappuccino eigentlich dann ganz normale kaffeebohnen kaufen oder spezielle espressobohnen warum wird da nirgends erkl rt,,ok ihr sagt man soll nur da doppelsieb nehmen wenn ich aber nun nur einen einfachen espresso mit dem 2er sieb haben will mus ich dann ca 8g kaffee nehmen und die taste f r eine tasse dr cken und diese mus dann nur ca 12 sekunden rauslaufen ansonsten w r beim 2er sieb ja viel zu viel wasser,ich fand da video super habe mir daraufhin die maschine gekauft und die tipps angewendet der hergestellte espresso ist echt gut geworden vielen dank,faustino,geilo da war meine erste maschine ich hab sie modifiziert die doppelwandigen siebe abgedrehmelt die dampflanze von dem ganzen mist befreit und man mus sehr gut temperatursurfen sonst wirds auch nicht so gut,ich habe keine m hle zu hause wen ich den kaffee im laden mahle welcher mahl grad ist der beste,dein video ist v llig okay,mein h ndler empfiehlt mir al single haushalt e s e pad die getestete maschine funktioniert auch mit e s e pad wieviel schlechter oder auch nicht schmeckt ein cappucchino der mit hilfe von e s e pad hergestellt wird,hallo thomas ganz im ernst diesen h ndler w rde ich in die w ste schicken er trinkt vermutlich selbst keinen kaffee e s e pad schmecken einfach wirklich schlechter anders und machen keinen espresso da hat verschiedene gr nde durch die mahlung von kaffee wird die spezifische oberfl che um ein vielfaches vergr ssert alterung und oxidation findet statt egal ob noch mal eingeschweist oder nicht die fl chtigen aromen von kaffee machen einen abgang da zweite problem ist da solche pad niemals einen angepassten mahlgrad haben sie bieten keinen ausreichenden widerstand wir haben diverse pad untersucht und k nnen die versichern diese kaffees sind mehr filterkaffee al espresso deshalb w rde ich dir eher raten eine filterkaffeemaschine zu nutzen al e s e pad fall dich da thema weiter interessiert unser video extraktion und st rke behandelt auch kurz zwischendurch da thema pad die haben in der regel einen st rke von um die 1 1 1 3 prozent tds,hallo euer video gef llt mir sehr gut danke hierf r wir haben die ec685 seit knapp 2 jahren mit dem optionalen edelstahl siebtr ger dem einwandigen graef 145722 siebeinsatz erst seit gestern und der graef cm800 m hle zu dem verwenden wir f r unseren crema kaffee lungo den schwiizer sch mli crema 100percent arabica der geh rt ja mit 13 99euros kg nicht zu den g nstigsten und schmeckt un sehr gut allerdings bekommen wir keine crema hin mit dem alten doppelwandigen delonghi sieb ein bisschen schaum w rt ihr so net und k nntet mir einen kaffee empfehlen wir hatten schon einige getestet aber viele marken kaffee sind nicht gleichm ig ger stet und schmecken verbrannt vg oli,araknalam danke f r deine tip dann schaue ich gleich mal nach einer r sterei in unserer umgebung und im internet werde jetzt auch zu dem meinen scarlet passion tamper gegen einen joefrax wechseln dann f llt mir al laie da tampern schon etwas leichter,13 99 pro kilo ist g nstiger kaffee guter kostet etwa da doppelte nimm frisch ger steten espresso am besten nicht lter al vier wochen aber gerne lter al eine woche damit er ausgegast ist au einer kleinen r sterei die finden sich in vielen gr eren st dten und auch im internet oder direkt bei den kaffeemachern die da video hier produziert haben allerdings k me bei denen beim versand nach deutschland wohl noch die kaffeesteuer zoll und mehrwertsteuer oben drauf lohnt daher eigentlich nicht in der schweiz kaffee zu bestellen beim mahlgrad der m hle finde ich kann man sich ganz gut von der feinen seite rantasten also so fein mahlen das nichts oder nur noch wenige tropfen rauskommen und dann so lange gr ber stellen und neu mahlen bi die menge in der tasse und die durchlaufzeit stimmen vorsicht in der m hle bleibt immer ein rest gemahlener kaffee die sollte man also nach einer mahlgradverstellung oder wenn die letzte mahlung l nger al eine stunde her ist erstmal leermahlen also ein paar sekunden mahlen und da pulver wegkippen da ist ziemliche verschwendung weshalb ich im privatbereich single dosing m hlen bspw die niche zero oder handm hlen bspw von kinu 1zpresso oder comandante bevorzuge,ich habe neulich da problem das da wasser nicht durchrinnt ich habr keine ahnung an wa sowas liegen kann,du musst den einsatz im siebtr ger herausnehmen da kleine loch ist dann meistens verstopft ich pustete da dann einfach durch,bin etwas verwirrt bez glich doppelsieb wie gehe ich denn dann vor wenn ich nur einen single shot espresso machen m chte auch mit doppelsieb und kafeemenge halbieren,ich hab die auch und die ist super,darf ich dich fragen welche kaffeem hle du daf r verwendest,super video besser al mein expresso schaffe e nicht da er gut schmeckt er ist immer bitter versuche deine empfehlungen einzuhalte er ist in 24sec draussen m chte da e ewas l nger dauert aber wenn ich etwas feiner mahle kommt da fast nichts mehr raus habe arabica bohnen drinn hat mir jemand ein tip,wenn bei feinerer mahlung zu wenig herauskommt kann man die menge kaffeemehl reduzieren gru frank,al tipp noch wegen dem tollen stiftung warentest aufkleber bevor man diesen abzieht einfach ein bisschen warm machen z b mit einem haarf n dann l st sich der kleber ohne viel schrubben und ohne r ckst nde von allein,habt ihr vielleicht eine empfehlung bei der wahl zwischen der dedica der sage bambino jeweils plus sage smart grinder und der sage barista express vielleicht w re ja sogar ein vergleichsvideo der kombinationen interessant denn sie liegen preislich in etwa dem gleichen rahmen lt 500euros p wirklich informative und sympathische video die ihr macht kompliment,danke f r den tollen test habe mir die maschine mit graef sieben geg nnt nach einwenig experimentieren krieg ich nun einen guten espresso mit der cm800 m hle hin die preis leistung ist top ich bin begeistert ich m chte meinen alten saeco vollautomaten nicht mehr zur ck,da freut un sehr wir haben un die graef diese woche angeschaut und sind noch auf keinen gr nen zweig gekommen m ssen da noch mal dran,f r den fall da jemand den optimalen tamper f r die maschine mit einem durchmesser von 50 5mm sucht ich bin hier f ndig geworden,moin bei h c ist der tamper gerade nicht zu haben habe nachgeschaut und ihn hier gefunden gru,warum nicht gleich eine g nstige m hle brauchen macht mehr sinn,chrom stahl plastik da ist alu billiges alu sieb kannst du ersetzen mit non pressurized gibts online f rn 5er,ich habe nichts verstanden aber da video ist klasse ich m chte die gleiche kaffeemaschine kaufen jung respekt gr e au russland,ich kann aufgrund einer unvertr glichkeit nur koffeinfreien kaffe trinken wir haben in der firma aber einen vollautomaten mit nur einem kaffefach darum bin ich derzeit noch auf eine eigene nespresso kapselmaschine direkt an meinem arbeitsplatz angewiesen mir ist da mit dem m ll aber ein dorn im auge und ich m chte gerne weg davon da ich die maschine nur f r mich im b ro verwenden m chte ist hier nat rlich der preis super ich w rde gerne von euch wissen ob der espresso au dieser maschine besser sein wird al au meiner nespressomaschine und vielleicht k nnt ihr mir auch einen guten koffeinfreien kaffee empfehlen der schon gemalen sehr gut mit dieser maschine funktioniert oder k nnt ihr eventuell auch pad empfehlen,w rde mich auch sehr interessieren mit dem entkoffeinierten kaffee,mal ehrlich ihr gebt euch wirklich mit einer pseudocrema au dem cremasieb und der verminderten extraktion aufgrund de n tigen gr beren mahlgrades zufrieden echt jetzt oder habt ihr mit einem einwandsieb gearbeitet,kaffeemacher danke f r die einsch tzung,crema ist un ziemlich egal der geschmack war voll ok,ich pers nlich w rde ja lieber die barista express benutzen vor allem bekommt man mehr f r sein geld,kostet aber wieder da doppelte im preissegment f r 200euros scheint man nichts besseres zu bekommen al die hier vorgestellte siebtr germaschine,mich w rde eine empfehlung f r eine passende m hle interessieren ich habe die dedica zu hause und suche noch nach einer vern nftigen m hle neu bi 300 euro gerne auch gebraucht hat jemand ein paar tip f r mich,graef cm800 130 eur bei amazon bin damit seit jahren sehr zufrieden,finde ich echt klasse da ihr auch diese preisklasse fair und ehrlich bewertet da ich nicht da n tige kleingeld habe war da echt eine riesige hilfe schade da ihr nicht da set mit der kaffem hle kg521 getestet habt h tte mich n mlich interessiert ob die auch da pr dikat voll ok bek me aber trotz dieser wirklich guten anleitung bekomme ich e leider noch nicht hin so nen sch nen espresso heraus zu ziehen wie du,my npf filter shot,investiert lieber mal in ein mikrofon ist ja grausam,update die maschine habe ich vor langer zeit zur ckgegeben hatte da problem wa die meisten hatten pumpe defekt gutes video aber wie bitte stellt ihr die menge ein welche in der tasse sein soll ja ich wei durch gedr ckthalten der taste nur treffe ich nie die menge die nach eurer formel sein m ssen zumal da gewicht mit kaffe und nur wasser auch noch unterschiedlich ist z hlt ihr die erste menge wasser beim br hvorgang mit danke,marina mueller dann kann wohl deine m hle nicht fein genug mahlen,da gleiche problem haben wir auch wir haben mit 13g kaffee gearbeitet die m hle steht schon auf dem feinsten mahlgrad wenn wir knapp 25 sek gedr ckt halten f r mich hei t e dann auch 25 sek extraktion kommen wir auf 50g getr nkemenge selbst wenn wir 1 3 ansetzten w rden ist der ertrag an sich zu hoch,habt ihr die menge von 32 5 ml auf den doppelten espressotaster gelegt ider auf den einfachen da habe ich leider nicht ganz verstanden,da habe ich auch nicht ganz verstanden da die einer ja ca 30 ml auswirft und man kann ja trotzdem ein zweiersieb dazu nutzen,marc b kler auf dem doppelten im einer passen um die 7 gramm und im doppelten 13 gramm,und ich versuche noch au meiner silvercrest einen guten espresso zu bekommen,moin mo he hatte bi vor kurzem auch ne silvercrest habe allerdings irgendwann mal gesehen das die von lidl wegen stromschlag zur ckgerufen wurde den kaufpreis erstattet bekommen und in die dedica investiert welten kannst ja schauen ob auch dein modell ist sonst lg,,tipp f r entfernen von aufklebern mit dem f n warm machen so geht fast jeder aufkleber r ckstandslos ab,einfaches salat l funktioniert auch super,desinfektionsmittel sterilium geht auch,michael wehinger wollte e auch gerade sagen,wd40 tuts auch,servus erstmal gro e lob an euch meine frage 13 gramm im sieb ca 33 gramm in der tasse ist da eine normale menge f r einen einfachen espresso oder geht da eigentlich schon richtung doppio,mani n stellst du unter da zweier sieb dann eine tasse mit 30ml oder 60ml,der einfache liegt normalerweise um die 8 gramm der doppelte ca 16 13 liegt also ziemlich dazwischen f r mich w re e eher ein einfacher mit etwas mehr wasser wichtig schmecken mus er,noch ein argument f r die maschine ist deren energie effizienz a mit automatischem standby meine frau und ich machen vielleicht 2 3 kaffees ber den tag verteilt und da erschien e mir zu schade jeweils f r einen espresso eine grosse schwere chromstahl maschine mit professioneller br hgruppe auf temperatur zu bringen bin einsteiger in die espresso welt und habe mir gerade vor drei wochen diese maschine gekauft hab gleich von beginn weg einen zweiten siebhalter bestellt welchen ich unten gekappt habe plus die einwandigen graef siebe funktioniert super mit frischem kaffee und einer guten m hle ergibt da eine feste dicke crema einzig der tamper druck ist schwierig ich wei nicht wie tolerant gr ssere maschinen sind aber manchmal kommt bei mir dann auch einfach mal kein kaffee raus p tolles video merci euch vielmal,hallo zusammen ich habe jetzt meine erste eigene wohnung und w rde so ca 400euros in die hand nehmen f r eine kaffeemaschine wa schon sehr viel geld f r mich ist ich w re auch mit alternativen zu einer maschine zufrieden mir ist allerdings wichtig das ich damit auch kaffe und nicht nur espresso machen kann h tte jemand einen guten tipp daf r w re super wenn in budget auch eine kaffeem hle p sste mit freundlichen gr en jannis p s einen milchsch uner brauche ich nicht unbedingt da ich meinen kaffee immer schwarz trinke f r g ste w re er allerdings auch nicht schlecht,orbit e gibt ein video wie man mit einer espressomaschine kaffee macht eigentlich einfach nur hei e wasser in den espresso,sehr cool und am sant den milchschaum habe ich damit noch nicht so gut hinbekommen wie du um latte art zu zaubern aber ich bleib dran danke f r den test weiter so,super video habe die maschine zu hause und war etwas verzweifelt du hast aber gezeigt das durch die richtige einstellung und perfekte handhabung ein wirklich gutes ergebnis erzielt wurde siehe der cappuccino danke f r da video und die tipps,welche kaffeem hle verwendet ihr denn die hier empfohlenen sind leider viel zu teuer f r mich,art iqx auch meine erfahrung handling ist am anfang schwer aber man lernt die eigenarten kennen und kann dann damit gut ungehen,wa ist an einem leichten tamper schlecht ich bitte um laiengerechte antwort danke,michel aeschbacher besten dank,guten abend danke f r die frage da problem ist weniger da gewicht al mehr die form mit einem so flachen und langen tamper ist e enorm schwierig pr zise zu tampen eine dickere base erleichter dy enorm und liegt auch angenehmer in der hand hilft dy weiter,toller bericht tolle darstellung aber habt ihr nur geld f r ein mikro die stimme de zweiten hallt au dem off und auch die r umlichkeiten selbst k nnten etwas mehr deko zum schallschlucken vertragen,danke f r den kommentar irgendwo weiter unten schon mal geschrieben ein funkmikro hat nicht funktioniert deshalb haben wir versucht die aufnahme zu retten und den sound von der einen handkamera genutzt,kleber bekommst du mit wd40 runter,detlef wenige gleicher tipp meiner frau,ich nehme immer normales rap bzw sonnenblumen l einfach ein blatt k chenkrepppapier mit etwas l benetzen und der etikettenschrecken hat ein ende,tolles video ihr zwei ein weiterer g nstiger klassiker w re die sage 875 w re toll wenn ihr die auch mal testet,hat jemand erfahrung im vergleich von dieser delonghi zur sage875 ist ein upgrade e wert,gibt e denn nachteile wenn da sieb nur ein kleines lock hat weil du e so oft betonst,patrick eggert warum nicht da loch gr er machen,stefan horst nein auf keinen fall eher einen bodenlosen siebtr ger kaufen gibt e f r die maschine bei amazon f r ca 25euros,also sollte mann da loch gr sser machen,vinzenz balk gute frage durch den hohen druck und die enorme wasserstauung die durch da kleine loch entstehen berextrahieren wir denn kaffee sehr stark w hrend de br hprozesses und e entstehen sehr viele bitterstoffe die bei einer normalen extraktion deutlich geringer w ren,um e kurz zu machen ihr habt eine professionelle ton und bildqualit t genauso seit ihr vom fach und habt da fachwissen welches ihr sehr kompetent weitergebt und ihr habt euch richtig zeitgenommen um da video zu machen ihr zeigt in ruhe die ganze maschine ihr habt mir keine fragen offen gelassen aber am besten finde ich noch das ihr die machine wirklich getestet habt und deswegen euer grundrezept zur bedienung weitergeben k nnt macht weiter so,ich fande da video echt gut gelungen und hilfreich jedoch w rde ich raten ein bisschen an der akustik im raum zu arbeiten die tonqualit t k nnte deutlich besser sein,f r meine minik che ist sie genau richtig ich habe mir aber einen bodenlosen siebtr ger mit einfachem sieb bestellt,black89velvet probieren kostet nichts da hast du recht allerdings besteht ja da problem darin das man zwei lav mics hat die beide die stimme aufzeichnen der schall braucht ja auch seine zeit um zur jeweiligen membran zu gelangen wenn die beiden mikros nun halt einen halben meter oder meter voneinander entfernt sind hat man einen unsch nen delay die phase anzugleichen kann dann manuell fummelig sein und phase umzukehren passt bei beweglichen mikros vermutlich auch eher selten au erdem hat da n here mikrofon ja ein deutlich bassigeres signal durch den nahbesprechungseffekt wodurch eine phaseninvertierung sowieso da signal nicht entfernen w rde deshalb mein tipp einfach ein noisegate bzw manuell da weiter entfernte lav mic deaktivieren oder in adobe audition gibt e auch hervorragende tool um hall und raumklang bzw unangenehme delay zu entfernen,benjamin l pple oder mal phase drehen probieren kann manchmal auch schon helfen al schnelle l sung,da problem h tte man vermutlich mit einem gut eingestellten noise gate auf beiden mikros in den griff bekommen oder man h tte eben da jeweils unbenutzte mikro stumm schalten m ssen der unangenehme hall effekt entsteht n mlich dadurch das die beiden mikrofone euch beide aufnehmen da diese allerdings nicht direkt nebeneinander liegen und der schall eurer stimme eine gewisse zeit braucht um zu dem weiter entfernten mikrofon zu kommen entsteht dieser effekt bei dem die stimme doppelt klingt um da zu vermeiden solltet ihr am besten so konstant wie m glich sprechen damit ihr die preamps nicht unn tig laut einstellen m sst in der nachbearbeitung w rde ich euch ein noise gate empfehlen oder eben das ihr da mikrofon de jeweils nicht sprechenden manuell leise stellt,kaffeemacher weniger raumakustik al eher aufnahme in diesem fall ist nat rlich rgerlich wenn man am ende erst merkt das die mikros vorverst rker nicht gut eingestellt waren,da ich eine sehr sehr kleine k che habe brauchte ich eine kleine siebtr germaschine und kaufte mir diese delonghi 685 mit einer comandante m hle hey und wa soll ich sagen diese maschine hatt mich voll und ganz berzeugt ich kaufte mir auch andere siebe ohne den doppelten boden wa noch mal da i t pfelchen im geschmack ausmachte kann sie nur empfehlen zur zeit mache ich sehr gerne lungo mit dieser maschine gute video bzw vorstellung dieser maschine,so geht e mir auch manche haben einfach keinen platz eine gro e maschine in die k che zu stellen wenn man diese maschine kritisiert m ge man bitte auch eine von der gr e und preis vergleichbare alternative nennen,testet doch mal die lelit pl41tem ne vern nftige einsteiger m glichkeit,danke f r diesis video ich bin laie wa siebtr ger angeht aber trinke sehr gerne guten kaffee und hatte mir von der maschine einen preisg nstigen einstieg in die welt der siebtr ger versprochen im internet findet man viele video f r den einstieg bzgl richtiger mengen vermeidung von channeling etc aber halt meistens mit deutlich teureren maschinen weswegen ich mit dieser maschine bi jetzt nur selten einen zufriedenstellenden cappuccino hinbekommen habe ich fand e sehr hilfreich mal einige tipps in bezug auf die eigenheiten dieser maschine von profis zu bekommen mal sehen wa ich jetzt au dem n chsten cappuccino herausholen kann,cooles video hey ab wann f ngt ihr an zu z hlen ab knopfdruck nach dem vorbr hen oder wenn der kaffee au dem siebtr ger tropft,volker sternemann ich w rde sagen das da dann eine spielerei ist die man mit seinen eigenen gegebenheiten kaffeesorte mahlgrad udg selbst herausfinden mus,kaffeemacher akademie amp r sterei und wann h rt der messprozess auf die frage mal komisch erscheinen aber wenn der knopf bei der programmierung losgelassen wird tr pfelt ja noch so einiges nach und by the way geht auch die kontrolle led nicht sofort au wann ist also der punkt erreicht wo die 25 bi 30 ez erreicht sein m ssen,hoi mirco ab knopfdruck extraktion beginnt wenn wasser und kaffee in ber hrung kommen gr sse benjamin,sch ne video ich benutze diese maschine seid ca 5 jahren und kann nur zustimmen man kann einen guten espresso damit zubereiten daf r sollte man allerdings noch in einige teile investieren gt siebe einwandig graef gt siebtr gerhalter au edelstahl gibt e von delonghi al zubeh r gt einen ordentlichen tamper wie ihr schon beschrieben habt insgesamt habe ich daf r ca 100 euro ausgegeben da mus man fairer weise beim kaufpreis mit einbeziehen dann bietet die maschine mit rund 250 290 euro immer noch ein spitzen preis leistungsverh ltnis die dampflanze finde ich allerdings nicht empfehlenswert ich gebe zu mit viel gutem willen kann man einen milchschaum erzeugen der f r einfache latteart in ordnung ist e macht aber keinen spa tipp man kann brigens einen wasserfilter direkt in den wassertank einsetzen,hallo bj rn ich bin auf der suche nach genau so einem wasserfilter f r den wassertank ich kann e da passende teil nicht finden hast du vllt einen link daf r gru,stefan hartzke den hager ich bei knethaken shop de bestellt delonghi 7313286019 siebtr ger f r ec680 ec685 dedica,hallo wie heisst denn genau der siebtr gerhalter au edelstahl von delonghi,danke f r deinen kommentar super so eine langzeiterfahrung mehrfach armotisiert die maschine,guter und ehrlicher test nice testet mal bitte die la specialista von delonghi da w rde mich eure meinung mal interessieren,top machine nur die siebe sollte man austauschen da sie doppelten boden haben klar den temper sollte man auch wechseln aber dann hat man eine espressomaschine zum g nstigen preis die genug druck aufbaut ich kriege damit besseren esspresso hin al ich in den meisten cafe bekomme,welcher sieb passt denn darein,also ich bin mega zufrieden seitdem die doppelbodensiebe weg sind der druck reicht locker f r top espresso,wa allerdings auch nicht f r die caf s spricht,habt ihr an der wassertemperatur auch etwas eingestellt diese kann man an der maschine ja in 3 stufen einstellen danke und gutes video,kaffeemacherhallo im video sagt ihr aber da die temperatur auf mittel war und ihr sie hochgeregelt habt wa ist richtig danke f r da hammer video hat mir sehr geholfen einfach nur gut,yep auf mittlere stufe,danke habe die maschine seit vier jahren und habe nie zeit gefunden mal ordentlich zu recherchieren und zu testen euer video bringt viele wertvolle tipps weiter so,kommt noch ein test von der sage bambino,ganz bestimmt k nnen aber nicht versprechen wann wir schreiben un alles auf und die liste wird immer l nger,hallo zusammen danke f r da informative video habt ihr erfahrung mit ascaso maschinen wenn ja wie habt ihr die empfunden sind die empfehlungswert f r einen einsteiger oder w re eine klassische rancilio silvia doch die bessere alternative,leider keine erfahrungen mit ascaso maschinen schauen wir un bei zeiten mal an,gutes video nur die tonaufnahmen sind nicht mittig,kaffeemacher dann beim n chsten mal die tonspur kurz in mono und dann wieder in stero konvertieren dann ist e wieder mittig ansonten auch egal der inhalt ist klasse und hat mir weitergeholfen vielen dank und weiter so,kaffeemacher der kragen vom hemd war einfach vor dem mikro man hat ja gemerkt da e ab und zu gepasst hat vom ton also n chsten mal ggf da mikro anders anbringen oder vorher testen,stimmt effektiv war die tonspur leider bei michel nur auf einem ohr drum haben wir rumgefriemelt um die aufnahme trotzdem zu retten wir sind im kaffee machen besser al im schneiden etc werden sicherheitshalber noch ein raummikro installieren,cooles video ich bin ebenfalls mit der dedica in die espressowelt gestartet allerdings habe ich sie von anfang an modifiziert wie schon in den kommentaren erw hnt wurde da mir milchschaum ziemlich wichtig ist habe ich sogar eine neue lanze verbaut die von der rancilio silvia v1 mit der man klasse microfoam machen konnte insgesamt war da ein super start,claudia alder auf diesem kanal gibt e upgrade f r die dedica zu sehen dort wird auch die lanze ausgetauscht,kann man denn die lanze von der rancillo silvia einfach an die dedica bauen oder ist da recht kompliziert danke f r deine antwort lg,kompliment eure aufzeichnungen sind mit abstand da besten im deutschsprachigen raum ihr seid f r mich praktisch ernie und bert de kaffees sehr syphatisch und unterhaltsam da video kommt genau passend denn ich selber habe mit der delonghi ec 680 erste version 2016 angefangen meine erfahrungen sind wirklich gut man bekommt mit viel bung einen guten espresso hin und deshalb ist f r mich die delonghi dedica der perfekte einstieg in die sieb tr ger welt denn ein guter espresso gelingt wirklich nur mit viel wissen und ausprobieren ganz aktuell habe ich mir jetzt eine lelit grace pl81t geg nnt ich bin schon sehr gespannt apropos lelit e w hre super wenn ihr mal maschinen in der unter 1000euros preisklasse vergleichen k nntet in den foren werden sehr oft die siebtr ger von lelit anna grace oder quickmill pippa 4100 empfohlen,danke christian und da ernie und bert kult sind nehmen wir da einfach mal al kompliment wir sind echt begeistertet das gerade da video der delonghi so gut ankommt und erweitern gerade die liste der maschinen die wir in dem bereich unter 1000 euro testen fr hliches kaffee trinken au basel benjamin,super video die essenzielle frage wie viele gute espressi die maschine macht bevor sie den geist aufgibt kann man in einem solchen test halt leider nicht feststellen die erfahrung zeigt ja leider das man bei solchen k ufen leider oft nicht spart sondern viel mehr geld zum fenster rauswirft denn wenn man nach der zweiten kaputten maschine dann doch eine hochwertigere kauft h tte man da geld f r die zwei g nstigen lieber anders ausgegeben wer billig kauft kauft eben oft teuer,kaffeemacher wir haben die maschine sogar im b ro dort l uft sie den ganzen tag schon seit 3 jahren und wird von 5 6 kolleg innen unterschiedlich achtsam benutzt bei so vielen nutzer innen die auch sehr unterschiedlich mit der maschine umgehen kann man bzgl haltbarkeit wirklich nicht meckern,nordros meinst du wenn der tank hinten alle ist und die pumpe luft ansaugt,ag flosse klar da liegt aber dann an der pumpe und die ulka ist auch bei den gro en namenhaften siebtr ger verbaut pumpen m gen e nicht wenn sie leer laufen und leider hat die dedeica keinen stop bei zu wenig wasser,habe die maschine seit 2015 und die rennt immer noch,english subtitle please,why,einfach ein super kanal,super video vielen dank daf r interessant w re auch mal ein review der lelit pl42 em geh rt ja auch zu den einsteigermaschinen und haben sogar noch eine integreirte m hle,ein test ber die quickmill pippa 4100 und lelit pl42 pl81 w rde mich auch sehr interessieren weil die siebtr ger ber einen manometer verf gen da sehe ich al vorteil gegen ber der rancilio silvia beim temperatur surfen,die habe ich auch im einsatz allerdings mit pid ist ganz ok allerdings h tte ich besser ohne integrierte m hle kaufen sollen seitdem ich eine extra m hle habe ist die integrierte m hle nicht mehr im einsatz gewesen und nimmt eigentlich nur platz weg,patrick beck da w rde mich auch interessieren habe auch die lelit im einsatz bin zu frieden mit dem preis leistung verh ltnis,ganz ordentlicher einstieg in die espresso welt dennoch habe ich meine dedica nach 3 monaten verkauft alle mal besser al jede kapsel oder pad maschine aber doch sp rbar weit von einem sehr gutem espresso entfernt klasse video,habe meine jetzt seit 2 wochen und habe alle parameter und ber 1 kg frische bohnen durch mit milch in ordnung aber pur einfach nur unterirdisch werde wohl auch wieder verkaufen,r ckst nde einfach mit isopropanol entfernen,araknalam ja nat rlich kostet da geld aber dann haben sie die erlaubnis die etiketten mit dem aufdruck zu produzieren und auf die produkte zu kleben hei t stiftung warentest hat mit den aufklebern nichts zu tun,ls2011schorsch erlaubnis ist gut stiftung warentest l sst sich da f rstlich bezahlen e gibt in deutschland praktisch keine bessere werbung f r ein produkt al ein testsieger oder sehr gut von stiftung warentest,mario jagern ich denke nicht das stiftung warentest selber aufkleber designed und diese an die firmen vertreibt die firmen werden m m n die aufkleber so wie alles andere produzieren mit der erlaubnis von stiftung warentest,hallo ich finde e toll da ihr auch mal im sehr g nstigen bereich testet nicht jeder ist bereit bzw kann 1000 2000 euro f r eine kaffeemaschine ausgeben wa vielleicht noch erw hnt werden sollte man programmiert bei der maschine keine wassermenge sondern eine zeitspanne f r die pumpenlaufzeit da kein durchflussmesser verbaut ist,klar hat er ein flowmeter ich habe letzte woche die pumpe und milchlanze ausgetauscht und bei der gelegenheit die flowmeter gereinigt der flowmeter ist sicherlich nicht super exakt aber er tut gute arbeit,h1 must du auch nicht ich hatte die maschine vorher und der espresso ist absolut ok und gut trinkbar,kaffeemacher da streite ich in keinster weise ab ich wollte nur vermeiden da nicht jemand denkt er bekommt ein flowmeter in dieser maschine,4ster hast du zuf llig eine idee wa die maschine zu tzlich misst,trotzdem ziemlich pr zise ein klassisches flow meter leistet nicht unbedingt bessere arbeit,hi super vielen dank f r diesis video auch ich habe mir diese maschine f r den einstieg geholt und mir eben ein cappuccino nach eurer empfehlung zubereitet und siehe da e ist ein ganz anderes mundgef hl entstanden al zuvor gr e,hey tobi wenn du experimentierfreudig bist schau dir auf youtube mal die mod modifikationen de siebtr gers an man ersetzt z b die standardsiebe durch einen 51mm non pressurzied basket filter um richtigen espresso br hen zu k nnen,ich habe meine entsprechend modifiziert da crema loch ist entsprechend aufzubohren nur so hat man den druckaufbau direkt am sieb und kann mit entsprechendem mahlwerk zum perfekten ergebnis kommen ich bin noch einen schritt weiter gegangen und habe da kunststoffinlay gek rzt und ein einwandiges zweier sieb von graef im einsatz ich finde bei diesem discountpreis kann man auch etwas basteln m ssen,ich habe meine dedica ec 680 auch ber die jahre modifiziert bei den crema eins tzen habe ich den unteren teil weggeflext al praktisch die erste schicht bi zum eigentlichen sieb hin da war schon eine lohnende modifizierung und sp ter kam dann noch der austausch der dampflanze durch die von der rancilio silvia zu dem bodenlosen siebtr ger kam ich noch nicht aber man sieht man kann noch so einiges au der maschine rausholen und da f r um die 150euros,kaffeemacher danke euch f r die vielen genialen video,sehr gute tipps danke,ganz tolles sehr informatives video ich empfehle die maschine ebenfalls al einsteiger espresso maschine f r solche die von den kapseln wegkommen wollen auch sehr positiv die dedica espresso maschine macht gg spezielle e s e pad maschinen die ber chf 300 kosten eine viel sch nere crema und einen intensiveren espresso eigentlich verr ckt f r diesen tiefen preis auch sch n und vor allem f r die damen interessant e gibt die dedica in verschiedenen farben,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,howcome did you not use a scale when copressing the coffe in order to control other confounding variable very unscientific o it affect a much a the fine put a regular scale underneath and press 15kg,great video thank you i have a question you are using the button for a single dose how can you get out so much coffee from that button did you program it,what scale did you brew the coffee at wa it number 1 5,thanks for sharing can u tell why used the single shot button not the double shot button,porque esas m quinas hacen tanto ruido,ada suara burung perkutut,incredible scene and camera,hello i have a delonghi d dica ec685 for a couple of month now however i am always in trouble to take a coffee right if fill the compartment with grounded coffee using the right measure that is available with the machine then a press the coffee just a bit with the right tool however the machine doe not take any coffee i need to use le coffee than the right measure to take a coffee doe this happen to you guy any suggestion of what is happening thank you,do you grind your own coffee maybe you grinding is too fine so the water doe not pas through a you have seen on the first shot he tried to take and the measure depends on the type of coffee usually dark roast require smaller dos and lighter roast higher dos if you are using the pressurised basket included in the machine that might be a whole other problem,beautiful shot both coffee and video i have the same machine but do not know if i can have the same result a 34gr extraction in 27 sec with the standard portafilter,valter nogueira fair enough also the only setting you can manage in the machine is amount of time for single or double shot not water flow so it pump for x second and depending on the grain size you get x amount of extraction with the standard port til filter i think you get a single shot 30gr in le than 10 second,that might be because the standard portafiller is pressurised so it will never let you play arround like he doing it take a ok coffee but it will never let you get the best shot possible,hi great video really appreciate it do you let the machine stop on it own or do you press it once you get the desired weight,pavel chamrad no programming mode for the amount of water,gallien with or without entering to programming mode,you can set it for a set amount of time by holding the button down while it pouring once you let go it remembers how long for and is set,how do you place the scale underneath and fit a cup in a well i feel like there is not enough room,this replaced a smaller keurig that i owned for 6 year mybest kitchen i wanted the convenience of the water receptacle and while this unit is much larger than the previous one i am very happy with my purchase the only downside to this larger model is having to move it from under the cabinet to place the pod and refill it i wa able to rectify this by purchasing glide mat for small appliance now it is perfect,the commercial machine always first drip is creamy the dedica start black dripping then turn to creamy,hi the bottomless are not longer available have you any others,this machine is great,interesting delonghi can be beautiful,thank you for the demo in depth with attention to detail love the final cup,hi there my espresso is quite bitter with dedica what would be the problem,how is the machine changing the time of the extraction based on the coffee mine is taking 10 second with every type of coffe,need to set the timing i assume u use pre setting mode,man what a video,what temperature setting did you use on your dedica,which temperature mode did you select in the setting how long do you wait for warming up i feel like my dedica is way too cold,where did you find tge portfliter,1,doe the black mirror scale stand on the base of the delonghi dedica in horizontal position or not,,just got my first ever espresso machine the 685 got myself italian espresso in finest ground at my local coffeeplace but the machine stop after 3 sec get no espresso trough to little pressure defect or do i need a more coars ground,what is the use of having 18g of coffee if you do not know the type of coffee you use,what bird is that in the background sound hawaiian,i can only fit 13 or 14 gram of ground coffee in my 51mm default portafilter is it because you use a different one so that it take 18g,same here i think that must be the issue the double basket is not quite double,i have a question what temperature do you advise to set low medium or high,depend on roast but darker might better with medium but high it universal mode for all roast because if too bitter you can adjust extraction time and yield lower than standard,always high for expresso,what a perfect video thanks for showing your process i have the delonghi 3420 and just ordered a naked portafilter and tamp from aliexpress so that i can play with all of the factor soon just like this i see you modified your steam wand too which is really cool,which brand is the portafilter im looking for one a well,raf yes just ordered a scale amp got a breville smart grinder pro to start it been fun,make sure you have a grinder that grind fine enough for espresso also a set of coffee scale these are very important if you want to do what is in the video,my machine is only able to do single shot no double shot any idea after somr research i found out that the thing where the coffe is inside ha a tiny hole which obstructs the inlay portalhead can be taken out and being cleaned so this wa the reason no problem after this the espresso are coming out really good and smooth now i will buy a scale now i think this is the safest way to make a constantly good coffee,34 7 gram for one shot of coffee,yes brew ratio 1 2 mean 18g of coffee to 36g of shot,how can i get rid of the sourness,did you press single shot or double shot button,could not tell the difference against the too coarse,you really need to upgrade to a better machine not saying that little guy is bad but you are clearly interested enough to justify some serious investment i had a rancilio silva good but very tricky machine for almost 10 year and one year ago upgraded to an ecm synchronika at the time it felt crazy to spend so much money on it but every single day when i wake up and get to use it and drink quality coffee i think it wa the best thing i ever did,which coffee bean u use for espresso,,how can you pull a shot using delonghi dedica when you have la marzocco linea mini,got the dedica to get the right expresso timing let said for a 18 gram of ground coffee ratio 1 3 how did you set up the time do you time the desire time ex 30 sec on the machine just letting flow hot water without portafilter or coffee and then you start to experiment with the coffee to find the proper ground,wondering the same figured it out yet,this wa so helpful,would you post link of your portafilter which grinder are you using i see you modified steam wound for rancillo is worth it is a long mode,extraction time get off on it is own or you have to manually stop it,manually hold the button for 27sec,soo how do i exactly get 1 2 ratio with the delonghi do i have to set the water extration time manually and how do you differentiate between single and double cup button,you can actually change the yield from the machine by holding the cup button see the instruction manual i did it but still get somewhat varying result i do not know if that is the machine is fault or my own inconsistency though also for all the espresso based milk drink i use the double cup and for a pure espresso shot i use the single cup one you have to adjust your dose to this a well in the video 18g were used for a single shot which is what i use my double shot button so this wa probably already changed for this machine,hi using 1zpresso jx pro grinder with this machine getting bitter shot using 17g 30m 25 s what i am missing,if you use the fine ground please do not do tamping hardly a these machine did not have real 15 bar,may i please ask how your single shot button at the end produce a double shot,tio deniz my machine give double shot from the singel cup button from the start i checked 42 gram water from the singel and about 80 gram from the double i have not programmed them,colin k yeah that make sense for me too but why use and program the single shot button instead of double shot button since it is already there d,i am pretty sure the button are programmable if you push and hold the button it will brew until you let go then it save the brew time so i guess technically you use the single shot button for a double shot,i watch every video with eye wide open so here is a suggested term to describe your video hypnotic poison,how are you able to fit 18 gram in there,it is not the original portafilter,so you time straight away v the first drip maybe i have been doing this wrong can someone help,hi great video could you give more detail on the bottomless portafilter you are using or if you got a special basket i have the same machine and bought a btmls portafilter but not able to get 18gr of coffee in thx,if your basket is smaller you can simply adjust your recipe to that if you can only fit 16g in your portafilter basket like me do everything the same way but program the machine to yield le water to match your decreased dose,hi where did you get the bottomless portafilter and also steam wand,is it possible to use this portafilter with the ec695 delonghi,for anyone curious on how to program the timer length of running water for the delonghi dedica ec685 gt,,bottomless siebtr ger siebtr ger bodenlos jetzt auch au de nur da sieb,hii do you mind telling your delonghi machine is setting the temperature water hardness etc thank you in advance,18 g of coffee per cup of espresso that is too much is not it it should be 7g for one cup,how many gram for single shot basket bottomless,is it best to time your brew from the time you push the button or when the brew start to drip i have seen some use both technique thanks,i use a different machine but i used to time my extraction from first drip then swapped to timing from when i clicked the brew button,if i put 15g of coffee in the non pressurized filtrer and at the end i have 50cl in 25 sec is ok because in this video he said between 7 and 8g of coffee for a result of 25cl in 25sec a i double the quantity is it ok to have 50cl,arty home ok but not really satisfied before i buy all the stuff i saw on youtube and amazon that with this machine and following this step the expresso is nothing compared to main bar pub and i do not see so much difference i use coffee bean name martella premium 20euros kg what do you think i taste another coffe,if you are satisfied with the taste considered successful,hi what is that thing called that rotate coffe in your portafilter before you use your metallic tamper and where do i find it thanks in advance,coffee distributor 51mm from ebay,hey i have a big problem with my delonghi dedica style coffee machine it is brand new however a soon a i put in coffee in the portafilter the machine struggle to push water through jt or so it seems and basically only work for around 5 second and no coffee come out but when i take out the portafilter i see that there is bunch of water inside it do you think it could have something to do with the size of my ground coffee,i think the problem is that the coffee you used is too fine try to make it more coarse,do not fill up the basket too full just enough that after you tamper it at the brim of the curve in the basket and do not tamper too hard if u coffee is grinded fine,i had the same problem the hole at the base of the filter wa blocked and i just removed the blocking particle,how many hole doe the steam wand of this machine have,could you please share the link where you bought the portafilter thanks,i bought it from ebay but i can not find this link,time of extraction is not automatic,i use this machine with ese pod and the espresso is absolutely great and the process is so easy,ese pod are absolute rubbish how can you compare dieter h get a decent grinder get some decent scale and a bottomless portafilter then come back,so you do not use these addon filter even,i just bought the dedica ec785 not sure if there are any difference with ec685 watching your video and reading all the comment now i am confused whether to program it using time metric 25 30 sec per brew time single or double dose or volume metric achieve 36gr for single dose or 69 gr for double,arty home thank you need to practice more while searching new electric grinder using slim plus for back to back espresso is surely painful,i think at 30 36 gram the time should be 25 30 second which is more appropriate,you press double or single,press single botton,where did u buy steam wand i want it,did u use single shot basket for 18 gr,yes it is a 1 2 brew,i have spent so much on coffee bean grinder amp machine watched all the utube video regarding how to get crema but no luck at all,a lot of factor going into final extraction im also at this point but for now my grinder is not a burr grinder so i need to get that first and then start to see what else i might be doing wrong like tamping experimenting with finer coarse setting with a burr grinder will take some time and coffee wastage which i hate but wont get the perfect brew on the first few try imo,that is why i am here same problem,your water temp is set to medium how about the water hardness then,im using nestle bottled so set it to medium check local water report stats or a quick google search might yield some result,that is so much work for one coffee,ikr but it is nice a an option if you want that perfect shot i wa thinking just using the pod,hi i have the dedica ec685 could you perhaps recommend the best budget grinder to use with this machine bare in mind i have the non pressurized basket thanks,saeed miramini i am really happy to hear that you got better coffee by increasing the tamping pressure after you got the new tamper i suggest you to adjust the grind size according to the taste of the coffee since not many people use the finest grind size of the breville smart grinder pro you may try to use coarser setting if your espresso is too bitter i hope you will get a better coffee experience with your new tamper and have a nice christmas,chan chun ho dear chan i really appreciate your comprehensive response and sharing your experience with me that wa really useful totally agree with you that due to larger pressure of dedica and the smaller thickness of coffee pack in the portafilter the optimum extraction time is shorter following your suggestion i increased the tamping pressure and managed to get a 15 s extraction finest grind setting 14gr coffee brewing ratio 1 2 the extraction and the taste of coffee wa better i have ordered a calibrated tamper to control my tamping pressure for even better and more consistent extraction thanks again cheer,saeed miramini hi saeed i have been using the ec685 and the breville smart grinder pro for half a year now i am happy to help and i hope you can find some of the point below useful 1 the normal situation is 25 30 second for 9 bar of pressure however the ec685 give you 15 bar of pressure it is expected that your shot will appear like 15 20 second 2 the normal portafilter ha a 58mm radius with 18 gram of coffee however the ec685 with the bottomless portafilter ha a 51mm radius with 15 16 gram of coffee so your shot will be even faster since the coffee puck will have le resistance 3 i have tried using the finest grind setting and it chocked the ec685 and no coffee came out a a result so if you have a short extraction even with the finest grind setting you have to tamp harder you need about 10kg of force to make the coffee puck harder before putting it into your ec685 here is the technique that i am currently using 10 15 kg tamping 15 0 gram in bottomless portafilter breville smart grinder pro setting at 9 scale from 50 to 1 extraction time at about 15 second please let me know if you made any improvement good luck,chan chun ho thanks chan i also have the breville grinder but struggling to get a 25 30 second extraction time the extraction time is very short even with the finest grind setting using bottomless portagilter what grind setting do you use any suggestion,using the breville smart grinder pro too have been using for 4 month now and it work great definitely the best choice for the price,when the scale cost more than the espresso machine neat this wa david fincher like cinematic craftsmanship well done the top down shot of the espresso machine is my favourite,thank you,sinceramente perfeito,did you set up timer on the first button or doe it automatically brew for 27sec,i saw a comment from arrty that they set that up themself i have not got an answer to how they did that setup process yet hoping they come through,i am looking forward to the answer of this question a well,,,hello what kind of portafilter do you use in the video,it is like meditation coffee asmr,haha did you go to toilet with a plan,how are you fitting 18g in this portafilter i struggle to do 16,micdogg187 lol grinder play bigger role than the coffee machine in espresso making a the expert say try playing with amount try 15 16g of coffee and see if you get a better cup,aadi maybe still trying to dial in my grind too fine a s nothing come out too course it is a water fall lol,micdogg187 then the only reason i can think of is the grind size probably it is not fine enough,aadi i have the same bottomless portafilter a well,it not the stock portafilter he is using bottomless portafilter with non pressurized basket,what is your timer setting for the single shot button do you use that timer for the 27 second or it is different from the timer of the weighing scale,doe exist also a bottomless for e s e,beautiful shot how long doe the dedica need to completely warmp up for a good espresso im currently using a flair and happy with it but i have the opportunity to borrow my cousin is dedica and im thinking if it worth the time playing around with it if i buy a bottomless pf and a decent basket thanks,the best coofee video thx from hungary,that is also how i do it annoying when you buy new grind and have to recalibrate it all again,hi what is the setting of you grinder,hi i am thinking about moving from nespresso to this i have no indepth coffee knowledge but would want to start getting to know it is this a good starter machine,vanichar s watch james hoffmann is channel i learnt most of the stuff from him,doug m thank you i have placed an order i think it will be very different from nespresso i do not really know how a good coffee should taste like i only know that i do not like the sour or burnt taste one any tip,it absolutely is the machine is easy to use but you will learn that making espresso is a bit of a skill you have to grind properly and tamp properly packing the grind into the basket and ensure you use the right amount of water i learned during this pandemic so you can too within a couple day you will be able to pull great shot out of this machine,may u explaine me what type of coffee super fine fine or gross that best creamy use with bottomless portable filter thank,thanks for this got a bottomless for my icona and had been testing out the coffee amount a well a timing etc this is a fantastic guide,hello great video do you think i can buy all this set to start and only have patience to become expert i have no experience,many thanks,hi nice review can you tell from a health perspective for example the type of thermoblock material and the rest of the part thanks and keep making good video,dateajay thanks,i once disassembled the machine to change the steam wand the thermoblock seems to be made of aluminum pipe are silicon and some plastic part,,zeljko velickovic,,how do you fit 18g of coffee in a 51mm portafilter the most i can get is like 12 and it overflowing at that point,2cups basket from aliexpress,salut tous,i can not get crema in my ec685 i use readily ground coffee it that why or is my coffee coarsely ground any advice thanks,i think the cause may be the instant coffee,sorry but i am begginer in coffee why is this the perfect shot thanks for sharing,caetano sauer thanks so much for the explanation based on your experience have a good day mate,to achieve good extraction a good rule of thumb is to produce around twice a much espresso a the coffee ground you put in in the video 34 7g espresso for 18g ground coffee within 25 to 30 second you achieve that by tuning your grind size until it is neither too coarse nor too fine,wooww look portafilter is the secret huh not the stock hope u can share that so we can xperience superb coffee,your vids are very much appreciated aesthetically absolutely top notch chapeau to your art of doing thing also most instructional too just fabulous,he even shaved his hand and arm for a nicer perfrct look,you are correct quality video

have you tried hotter yet,medium,nice v deo what would be the dose for a double shot,td0252 it is not espresso nowadays is way more than 7 gram,i think this is allready a double shot single shot is 7 gram,hello and how are you tank you for beautiful video should the boiler be cooled or not after using the steam wand of delonghi,you have 2 bottomless portafilter what difference between them,i love your shot quick question i have an almost identical setup the only thing missing is a good grinder would you advise the compak k3 touch or would you recommend another one for good espresso,hi i tried but it extraction is too fast even with fine grind,the reason of this problem is your machine creating a channel in coffee,the coffee bean must be grinded more thoroughly,and no crema,nice vid do you have a vid on how to change the steaming wand english version pls thank you,hi arty thank you so much for your gerat video which of the three temperature setting is better best wish,arty home how to

you please share the link of the distribution took and the tamper i have a bottomless filter but my tamper get stuck in it i want to order the same set of tool a you have thanks,i have got that one too,same a me sir,you grind the coffee too fine course for that machine it should not flow a drop,18g is not too much for 1 espresso at the cafe they said that they use 17g for 2 espresso hmm i am the new here,jens 34 gr is not a double shot,this is a double shot espresso,wow thanks for the video man i have been looking for this video in month,hmmm my dedica give me 17g in to 78g in the cup plus a fair amount spraying all over the floor and nearby surface all in the space of a few second how do you get it to go so slowly with an unpressurised basket,dananskidolf super i can not find the niche here but if i get lucky to travel abroad defo bringing one home thank you,mike sharp my niche solution above probably doe not help you much on a tight budget in your position i would go with a hand grinder but make sure it get reviewed particularly for espresso since you mention james hoffman he did review some hand grinder and it is a great watch but iirc his focus wa more on filter coffee coarseness so have a good look around i hope you find something that suit your need,mike sharp i wa using a kg79 that came with the dedica i have moved to a niche zero which can go much finer and is giving me better result by far a you would expect my dad is having a good time using my old kg79 for his filter coffee machine now all that is left is to upgrade the espresso machine,dananskidolf what grinder are were you using im trying to get my hand on the delonghi gc89 the gc79 had good espresso setting but i can not find that anymore gc89 people say is inconsistent im stuck on a budget and my first attempt at using a 2 cup bottomless portafilter from aliexpress using a blade grinder and a trick james hoffman showed using tissue to get fine stuff out wa so time consuming made a great puck but the coffee a i watched it come out wa far from what i wanted to replicate in this near perfect video representation grind uneven and not close to an even distribution of fine solid so im gon na hav eto wait until i get one also looking into hand grinder but each ha it own rabbit hole that im overly consumed with not helping,arty home i checked the setting and it wa already on the finest it can do small improvement from more tamping pressure but still only about 8 sec for 35g out and face meltingly acidic i think i need an upgrade from the grinder that came with the dedica,what portifilter are you using can you post a link,where did you find the little basket that allows you to transfer your coffee from your grinder to your filter holder,arty home thanks fort your answer love your work,stainless steel cup 2oz form ebay,hi after start using portafilter from aliexpress it now start to unscrew and fall down this is really danger now even with original protafilter i feel it is not very stable and it move a bit unscrewing when water is being pushed throught what can be wrong,can a 54mm portafilter be used for this machine,51mm only,nice vid what tool are you using exactly where did you get them what is the size of your basket 51x25mm,1 delonghi dedica e686 2 bottomless basket you can get from ebay shopee lazada and amazon sir thank you me later,delonghi is machine is very good i use magnifica s and it taste too good and i drink too much coffee the video wa very helpful with love from japan,how did you put another steam lance on the espresso machine thanks,,someone said time counter should be started at 1st drip however someone said time counter should be started when pressing the ec685 coffee button i would like to know which one is correct many thanks,i think it work for both which method do you like use that method,using delonghi and the mini do you taste any difference in espresso,la marzocco taste will be clearer delonghi is doing well it work,that is what i want to know he pull perfect shot from both but how much is taste difference,delonghi dedica ec685 available in india now with delonghi india distributor orion professional appliance call 91 9899332022,hey did you re program the amount of the water or did you just use the standard infusion amount,arty home hi arty what setting did you use for the amount of water i have got everything else set to what you were using thank you,what amount of water setting did you use for this video,arty home how did u know what amount to set it too,yes i set a new amount of water,what is that shot glass,i bought it from a coffee maker,thanks for this a link for the portafilter,hi what is the name of the frother again huhuhu,you can set timemore black mirror scale to autostart via press clock sign rapidly until beep sound came on,,this video is what i wa missing in life,thanks mate so what grind size should i ask my roster toby is estate wa to grind to i have just brought the same bottomless porter filter a you too is it 14,my dedica sometimes spurt out the side of the portafilter any advice,mwa01 im using unpressurised so probably too much tamping a well i guess,if you are still using the pressurized basket i would guess too much tampering,hi everyone any idea where i can get bottomless portarfilter for delonghi dedica thanks,you can search in ebay or aliexpress just search by ec685 portafilter or 51mm portafilter,bottomless portafilter ec685,ebay,size of your tamper d thanks,51mm,did you program the amount of water the machine push through the puck or is this factory setting,christoph marius thank you so much for clarifying this i wa always unsure whether i am inconsistent or whether the machine wa is this a problem with higher quality espresso machine a well,you should definetly programm the maschine i programmed my machine so that on a double shot it extrakts around 69g of pure water without the portafilter attached this setting will get me with a 16g dose to the desired parameter of a 2 0 2 2 extraction ratio depending on the grind setting and a extraction time between 20 and 30 sec be aware that programming the right amount of water can be tricky and take couple of shot but because i programm without any portafilter no coffee is wasted just hold the middle button until the scale show the right amount pro tipp release the button approximately 5 sec before 69gramms good luck one more thing the dedica is inherently inconsistent so if you think you are doing exactly the same thing a the previous shot but the extraction time varies when your puc prep is the same the maschine wa the one who wa not consistent,many mistake,how to set brew time,arty home wow i did not know my machine could do that thanks a lot,,shout out to the snow peak mug i have destroyed my lip on mine more time than i can count,lmao they need a rubber slip over the rim or something,,,i do not even like coffee what am i doing here,thanks,woho loved it mate now first i need is that bottomless porter filter and i will follow your method,,hey i saw you do have a different steam tap on your dedica how do you manged that and which one is it the regular one is not to bad if you take off the attachment but still not enough regard,,anyone know the exact place i can order this portafilter,,you can not make a perfect shot with this machine because of it inconsistent temperature while brewing,victor d rocket appartamento,walter white which is,arty home had this machine with the same set up for 8 year und made thousand of espressi none of these tasted a good a from my new machine,thank you,do you use a 2xshot or 4xshot basket,definitely a standard double shot basket 18g is pretty snug in there,i would like to know this too,how do you manage brew time just let the machine do it thing or you stop it yourself and did you calibrate the amount in the machine thanks a lot,you can programm the time amount of water you can not set a fixed time with the dedica what he is doing in the other video is setting a specific amount of water the time will depend on you the grind and therefor change every time you change amount or type of coffee or grind size it is a bit misleading to say you can time your shot like that,i set a timer to stop brewing follow this link,nice one still remember when i had one of this espresso machine and get frustated about how to make a perfect shot,laura castro it is in the discription,arty home so what grinder are you using,arty home lol absolutely,i have to spend time with it and found that a good grinder will help do this,where did you get the dosing cup i can not find one,arty home thanks,,do you think the tampering pressure could effect the bitterness also,yes sure,of course,if course,ohhh perfect shot,no matter how fine i grind the coffee bean the quantity i am looking for get extracted much faster than the optimal any suggestion on the reason can it be the pressure i put when tampering i am still using the plastic default tool,enemyofthemusicbusiness with the standard single shot pressurised portafilter and 7 gram i am not sure if it even ha to be 30 second to taste good when only using 7g i can only easily achieve the suggestet ratio and time when usin a portafilter which can fit 18 gram 18 gram is alot of coffee each time so it cost alot of money over time so i am also looking for possinilities to make good coffee using only 9g like they do in italy,alexander schmidt thank you for your reply i use the default portafilter so not the one in the video the dosage for a single shot if i am not mistaken is 7gr and i expect about 25gr out i have used all kind of grinding size commercial grinded coffee although i understand a difference in taste the extraction of 25gr is always much faster than the suggested time 13 sec instead of 25 sec,are you using a bottomless unpressurised portafilter like in the video how much coffee doed fit into the basket are you using freshly roasted coffee bean or beam from the supermarket what grinder do you use for me the biggest factor causing an extraction which u too fast are not using freshly ground coffee bean having le than 18g in the basket having a grinder which can not grind fine enough,nice work do you have a link for the bottomless portafilter amp the filter do you used,arty home many thanks,,nice camera work too there,thanks,hi arty home thanks for your great video i have a two year old dedica 860 just bought myself a bottomless portafilter about a week ago thanks to your advice and others i have managed to pull a decent express shot with a cheap electric blade grinder the secret wa grind a fine a i could and to sieve the result here is the result that i have uploaded i have a sage pro dose grinder on order which can only improve thing the improvement in taste using the bottomless portafilter is noticeable sweeter and more delicious,update apparently i wa brewing too coarse im now getting 1 2 ratio in 32 sec thank you arty home and highfell1 your video and comment gave me hope cheer,highfell1 good day thank you so much for sharing i have a similar setup with yours except i have the sage smart grinder pro i have my grind size at 6 but my ratio and time are waaayy off 16g in 68g out 26secs would you happen to know what i can do to fix this did you experience something similar at first too,just got my sage dose control pro second day of grinding shot definitely fine enough and definitely better than a blade grinder on my first shot set the grinder to 6 and tampered hard amp the expresso would not go through successfully now it is on 8 but maybe 7 is best in 16g out 46g 30 sec shot,it is great,how the hell are you getting 18 gram into your portafilter this is an impossibility for me anything higher than 15grams into my double basket produce a mountain and i spill ground everywhere,the standard basket single dose seems to fit only 9 21 gram the 2 cup basket only doe 12 91 which is weird i would have expected double of the single dose basket the aliexpress portafilter i got 51mm fit only 17 barely but i think it due to the grind size not being fine enough and consistent using a blade grinder i can not find a decent burr grinder locally,are you using the double bottom one that come with it that one is tiny i modded the original handle by cutting of the bottom and inserting a cheap basket that is not slanted mine is now bottomless and can hold up to 17g,not all portafilters can fit 18g i have one doubleportafilterbasket which only fit 15 gram and anotherone which actually can fit 18 gram,if you get the portafilter bottomless you can fit coffee up to 20g a the basket is bigger then the one come with the machine,you have not grinded the coffee bean finely enough,good morning enjoy your coffee,hello it is not the original pressurized portafilter where did you get this one very beautiful extraction,,look for bottomless portafilter delonghi 51mm on aliexpress or ebay,tomar un gin,cool video can you please share the link to your portafilter,thanks now i have a reference for what to expect from my dedica might take me a while though to figure out how to consistently get a similar result,,hi how did you do the purge cleaning so short time at 2 40,you can press the coffee button again to stop the process at any time,press the one cup button for the second time shortly after you did it for the first time,hello i have a question i am only getting maximum 70deg c water temp on my highest setting are you able to check yours,how do you even measure the temperature you would have to measure it before the shower inside of the machine to get an a good read everywhere after it will have already cooled down also the shower increase the surface of the water speeding up cooling,bulent yalcin ok thx,michael ouzas i set the highest temperature and the result of 5 attemt after eachother 64 74 74 79 and 82 celcius i read similar experience of some other dedica 685 user,arty home if it is not hard are you able to just a crossreference i made a few today i maxed out at 75degc,i am sorry i have never measured temperature from this device,hi how did u modify the ec685 milk frother rod,,hi short question i have the same setup but my portafilter squirt around the coffee to all side any idea why and how to fix this,i read online a well a the correct burr grind setting and distribution of ground channelling can also occur due to not enough ground i can only get 15grams into my 2 cup modified naked delonghi basket so have found a 4 cup 51mm basket on aliexpress i have just ordered today will be able to get the correct amount of ground in then,tehral h so i am not an expert but do you have a burr grinder if you are using a simple blade grinder the uneven particle size could cause channeling,humayun haroon i always make sure to at least make the top nice but i think the grinder is a bad one cheap one i will grind at home and take it to work to check if that fix it my setup at home is a bit better than at work,squirting also mean the coffee is channeling got ta prepare the puck better,hey the reason might be the coffee you are using it might be your preparation make sure those two thing are on point,i notice you press single shot button did you change any setting is not it 18g for double shot a i can not get any closer to the figure i am getting 18g in 29sec for 40g,nemanja stanimirov you can not set the time on a dedica you can only set an amount try it yourself without filter or coffee i get around 36 gram of water in 12 second then put the basket with coffee i used my previously used one a i did not want to waste coffee now i get 30 gram of water in 20 second the rest of the water is on the coffee time purely depends on your coffee you will only reach the same time if the rest of the setting are also the same,nemanja stanimirov thanks for the idea will try that out,kimura lim i have same dedica and i programmed it to be more than 30 but i measure my yield and i manualy stop it when i want depending on a coffee bean i use sometimes it better to be longer extraction sometimes shorter,nemanja stanimirov yea i get what u mean bro,kimura lim im just saying that you can change duration of extraction for each button a your comment wa why did he use single button when he us 18g busket well maybe he us another button for lungo im just saying who care which button he press when you can program both button and even change their position i didnt mention your yield at all 18g in 29sec to get 40g of liquid is good,great video thank you beautiful that last shot can you please tell me where did you get this fine bottomless portafilter i have been on the hunt since age but i only find one specific type currently in the mail but yours seems a a great step up in quality also 18g for single shot doe it work well i use the original filter with a non pressurized double cup but from 18g of bean i can pull 2 somewhat good espresso at a time grinder is cm702,you have to cut it open yourself usually s thats what i did i got one from graef and cut it open,,when to start the time for the extraction right when you press the button with the preinfusion,yes with preinfusion,you got ta open a cabinet and throw your delonghis in and forget about them linea is the pinnacle of home espresso and while it might feel very different and weird to you a it is very soon since you got it will elevate you to other level due to how good technique you have keep up the good work keep experimenting and merry christmas,i have a dedica but my grinder is just a cheap delonghi kg79 i am on the fence to buy a eureka mignon doe an expensive grinder really make a big difference,istepless mignon is the right key,yeah sadly they do,yes it matter a lot i wa using breville 870 integrated grinder had adjusted both burr to the finest setting still unable to get the correct brew ratio and got fed up with it i just got my eureka mignon manuale one week ago and totally satisfied with the coffee ground it produced,yeah always go for a good grinder,hey what kind of basket do you use 18g is a lot even for my graef one,this is true in my case i also got a delonghi and aliexpress botomless 2cups filter and with 14g is enough probably 18g is way to much for this filter,he used bottomless basket sir good for espresso,2cups basket from aliexpress,4 cup basket could be wrong,i have a question got a manual grinder and i wa able to get really good result with some coffee around 18 5 g to 36 37 in 25 30 sec when i switched the coffee to i think a darker roast i had to decrease the amount of coffee a 18 5 g or 18 do not go into this basket you can feel that while grinding a it requires le strength it would be all ok for me to dial in if not for a problem i have stumbled upon that wa not present in previous type of coffee it seems that at some grinding level the basket get open portafilter get clogged despite coffee running smoothly for like 20 g and the pump ha issue to pump more this wa not a case in other coffee if i go with the coffee coarser the coffee is under extracted 20 sec for 60 g i tried a range of formula without anything being close to the previous formula from what i have noticed when the extraction is finished you can feel underpressure in the basket this wa not present also in previous recipe even if they were over extracted also the coffee pie is very often crunchy and not solid,ukasz w odarski if it wa so fresh no wonder you had some issue next time you feel like buying some ask for stuff that is two week old it will be super easier to dial in and get a decent extraction,l a b thank a lot it wa supposed to be freshly grounded a per description it the first time i have bought from them i will see with a new coffee we got for christmas last shot i have pulled had to be pretty fine but only 16 g it went too fast but you could see that the pump had some issue at some point,first thing to look into before frying braincells are 1 is the coffee to fresh or too old too fresh or too old coffee can be unpredictable in extraction and especially in fresh coffee until it is in it is peak may require many adjustment before drinking something decent aim for coffee roasted 2 week before you intend to brew it 2 is the coffee from a roaster you buy from often coffee is a huge thing and believe it or not sometimes mistake happen when roasting coffee maybe your batch wa an unlucky fella so do not let it grind your gear too much if neither of these seems to be the problem the next big thing is your grinder but that is a bigger talk for another day xd merry christmas,bro when change size grinder need to run spinning is it please advice,depends if you go le fine no finer yes while changing let it run in order not to damage it,i want to ask if u change the extraction time setting or it just auto extract depends on the coffee ground,max exactly,arty home your first pull wa 40 second the last wa 28 you did not control that with button press,for this machine you can not set the time the variable you can fix is the amount of water time will then depend on the coffee,i set an automatic time change the size in grinding only,i finally got these result after using about 200g of bean i have got a manual grinder so feel like i can skip a day at the gym this week haha could you do a tutorial on how to get the perfect milk for latte art i feel like that is the next step for me and would be a great follow on vid,thanks for still putting out a dedica video after getting a linea mini,thanks for your video i love how you do them what you transmit thanks to this i finally took the step to buy a coffee maker in condition like the one you have this friday i will release it i have bought ground coffee the perfect combination for any coffee is 25 30 second with 18 gram,hey buying ground coffee is not a good idea and how much coffee fit in the basket is not always the same with lighter coffee dosage will be higher darker le you can google all the info,thanks a lot for you help,but always with the proportion of 18 g that is what fit in the bowl yes,arty home perfect his thing is to play with time for example more intense and dense le time softer and more liquid more time right,not always you may need to find time and the right weight for your favorite flavor but using this ratio can be the first step,i have an issue with the bottomless portafilter spraying and it happens with fine and coarse grind i read it could be stale bean so i used a new batch still happens any suggestion,kirk way i have always tapped the counter i will try your method next time thanks,that mean poor distribution i stir it with thin wire and then tap with my fingernail on the bottom no taping on the table this make it worse,are you sure that the grinder can it grind finely,any chance you can share the aliexpress link of the bottomless portafilter thanks can not find one myself thanks for the video,bill joel i got whole machine for 140dollar double the price of that portafilter,hey i am getting a 1 4 ratio what can i do to reduce it to 1 2 i get a good nice taste though did you adjust water temp or hardness love your video btw,piotr g borys you need to hold the 1 cup button until the desired amount water gram then release,arty home arty home hi arty a few comment above you mentioned you set your temperature to medium but now you have it on highest im confused,hi guy i can not set my extraction time i press the one cup button and i have 37g of espresso in 10 sec,i set the temperature to the highest,ec685

9,had the breville it died after a year despite cleaning descaling and managing i would not recommend it,the new lilit anna is amazing it ha now a screen where you can see and modify the temperature of the boiler and they replace the botons with three metal switch like you find on a plane cockpit,i have had gaggia classic for about 8 year i tried many type of coffee and i watched ton of different video i clean it with vinegar fro time to time my main problem is that my espresso each time turn out so bitter and so unpleasant sometimes it is not so bad but in any case it is impossible to drink without milk cappuccino it just doe not taste good any idea i truly appreciate you advice any better machine out there,so james doe not like steam coffee maker those 3 5bar machine for example,summary 18 05 great video james a always,thanks a lot james for in depth review i recently buy home espresso machine and try to dial in the espresso like commercial machine but hey you got what you paid d,delonghi you take the bottom tray out for taller cup,i have a delonghi bco432 combo appliance i am no coffee afficionado by any stretch of the imagination but i think the shot are pretty drinkable when you consider the price it is not the best i have ever had by any mean but you can get by on it it doe a great job with drip coffee too and i often use it that way if i do not want to bother with making a cappuccino or latte milk steaming and frothing on the other hand ha been super frustrating some of that might be my lack of skill but i do not think the machine doe me any favor the steaming frothing mechanism on the delonghi machine shown here is the same a on my machine and it is not great i am hoping for automatic machine to become more affordable because i do not really give a damn about learning how to be a barista i just want it to be good and consistent and not make me wish i had run out to a caf instead at my office there is a jura giga 5 that i absolutely love but can not afford for home it is very consistent i know there are some more affordable automatic machine than the jura but they are still not affordable enough for me,i am still looking for a reasonably priced espresso machine and am somewhat leaning towards the gaggia and am on the fence for one this is indeed quite the rabbit hole my main issue is that i have had access to a kees van der westen speedster for a while which i absolutely loved the feel and the design of it is heavy all around and also built like a tank and at 50 something kilo it feel about a heavy too it spoiled me rotten problem is the speedster is basically a 10 000 euro built to order commercial machine packaged for the home if you have lot of space that is which i do not and even if i could not for the life of me justify spending that kind of money,we need a 2022 update iam in need of a new machine,please review the gemilai crm3605 day 1,your video are very informative i am looking for some advice on my gaggia classic i just started using it and the first two shot i pulled were bitter i use the crema perfetta filter with cafe lavazza espresso italiano any advice,we need to know how you do your hair bro,very happy with my gaggia with the 9 bar spring and better basket also finally found a bottomless portafilter which i am very happy with also the brass brew head an annoyance on mine is that the red light fall down from their location and it is sometimes hard to see the light i have tried securing them with electrical tape but so far it doe not stay well what with the extreme of temperature etc still i love the shot you are right about temperature control being a bit too variable thanks for the review,this channel is so interesting,i have lot of hobby i do not need another i would sort of like a good shot of espresso though no answer here,i do not get the basket thing i will keep watching your video until i find an explanation,so what is a shot 1 oz 30ml seems imprecise for such a precise fellow,for those considering delonghi the stock pot on delonghi doe not get you espresso opt for another machine if you are after proper coffee rather than saving money,3 50 and the drip tray is really small drip tray,using a bambino plus for half a year already with the smart grinder on the side my advice get a good grinder something that can grind finer than supermarket espresso grind it is the marriage between the grinder and the machine that make up a good coffee if you buy the smart grinder be careful with light roast a they strain the grinder is internals you can fill the hopper full with dark roast but for light roast only grind what you will brew it really kinda closed the deal with u when we realized that two thing became possible at the same time i can play around with espresso and bean and grind she can prepare milk and coffee drink by just pressing a button if you happen to be in the same situation go for the bambino plus,how would you say the rancilio silvia compare to a bezzera hobby,thank you for your content james every video is so helpful and even just the way you talk through the information is very easy to listen to if you ever do an audiobook i want to find it because i bet it sound great,well look at that i could have just looked at your info and i see you have one,i like to watch and listen at high speed 1 5 to 1 75 speed funny enough it sound like you have had five expressos before recording the vid love it great info,18 00 summary,what about the solis barista perfetta i have to say i do not drink espresso i line larger amount of coffee like lungo cafe creme or a big cafe au lait,i really like the review that have a scorecard with category and point those are extremely helpful,gaggia uk used to call in for bit and bob in elland there is another company there i belive that is a sort of gaggia uk new style is not there,about to go in for the bambino because i am totally noob to modding i didnt even knew it wa a thing until 22 19 minute ago thanks for the review p somebody else recommended also getting a 54mm naked portafilter and basket might think about that upgrade,can you make one for machine under dollar1 000 thanks,next kitchen aid espresso review,am beginner am confused first machine please,niche grind setting are when calibration is set to 0 just trying to get a good starting point here just got my niche a couple day ago,if i were to buy an espresso maker it would also have to make very hot coffee but not so hot that it ruin the brew,the sage bambino pro is dollar699 i can not see spending that much to make a cup of coffee i have a pink mocha pot that i adore i would love an espresso maker but i have very bad hand and i would have to go higher priced to get thing that do not require a lot of hand strength and do not cause pain,can you review the gevi 20 bar compact professional espresso machine,lmao this guy make me feel so insecure about not dropping 1500 dollar on an espresso setup,i had an espresso at a shop with an 11k la marzocco machine and had one of the worst americanos of my life my espresso with my dedica knock those out of the park just cause a machine is expensive doe not necessarily mean good,i have used the dedica for a long time it nice the only thing thats bad imo is the tray,before i watch this video i want to comment that i have that red machine mine is black and i am pleasantly surprised by how it can make nice tasting coffee for such a cheap machine you have to be careful how you use it because it can not handle a good tamping so it doe not make very strong espresso but my morning long black with that machine is extremely acceptable now let is see what mr hoffmann think,sigh my champagne budget heart say get one but my beer budget brain say meh it is just coffee so i will watch your best under dollar100 too,i wish you linked to the basket you used i bought the delongi 8 year ago and it is still going strong,am i the only one that want a milk steamer wand that is longer nothing more annoying than holding the milk cup for 30 45 second until it look right i want to be able to put my milk in the cup and put the cup on the tray and let it steam only 1 of these allowed you to do that,hi could you link the basket you used on the bambino thank you,i am considering lelit anna v gaggia classic pro wan na ask if it is a key concern on 57mm if i am an amateur brewer,which vst basket specifically would be recommend to use with the sage bambino,i tested the delonghi steam wand by steaming without the metal spout it produce much le froth for latte and the steam output is more powerful,i have now had the gaggia classic pro for a few month and would add a few thing to this excellent review milk steaming power is not a problem if you start steaming before the heating element switch off and the light turn on the lack of space beneath the portafilter is a problem but at least if you are in the uk you can now buy a shorter aftermarket drip tray made for this machine here in the u i had my daughter 3d print me one from plan available at no charge online and it work perfectly the opv mod wa very easy and effective the better filter basket wa a big improvement eventually i will probably do the pid mod but result for now are good,i am now selling my 9 year old rancilio silvia you were right on about the machine one thing i liked about the machine wa the drip tray not deep and a need to draw it out carefully but it wa metal easy clean no imbedded coffee residue in plastic i had a gaggia and i hated the plastic drip tray the steam wand and the water filling yes you full from the top but the opening is small and sliding the water reservoir forward necessitated removing the portafilter then those poorly designed portafilter handle the rancilio wa well worth the extra cost hand down thank for your review,there is a lelit anna with a built in pid is it worth it over a gaggia classic pro if they are about the same price the only thing that bother me is the 57mm portafilter,seattle coffee gear is selling a modded silvia with pid already installed it is an additional investment but i believe it is well worth it because there is no more need for temperature surfing,how come not the pid anna it is cheaper than the silvia most place not by list price but most seller have it for 400 500euros,rancilio silvia v bezzera bz10 i i have had the latter for a couple of year and i am utterly delighted with it i recently bought a silvia to put in my office and l have been utterly underwhelmed a noted by james it is not possible to get consistent brewing temperature and so taste is inconsistent the small tray area and volume mean that there is always a mess on my bench afterwards unless you enjoy tweaking i would spend the extra on a heat exchanger machine like the bz10 it is soo much le fiddly,thanks for your investigation we bought an illy x1,i watched so many video from james that i do not even wonder that he put a dollar300 scale on a dollar170 machine,how come james never reviewed a la marzocco,great video i have the delonghi and i can say if you are willing to experience with grind and stuff you are able to get an incredible good espresso out of it for this amount of money it is extreme you need the other basket that is true but i get extremely textured and nearly or sometimes absolutely perfect extracted espressoshots out of it 25 28 second of extraction 15 16g on 30 38g depending on how i like it i am normally more into 1 2 instead of 1 2 5 i could grind extremely fine and i found it reasonable helpful to grind 2 different type for one shot 10g extremely fine nearly like you would to for gastro machine and 5g one step coarse in fact that is the thing on any grinder there is literally no grinder who can grind every particle same size you have always more or le particle which are finer or coarse i take advantage out of this i could see video where people had to grind le fine for their 700 1500euros machine with the same grinder,james is the sage still the best machine for me if i do not want a new hobby but wan na make great home cappuccino for myself and my lovely partner the breville barista plus is absolutely out of the question is not it,please take a look at the sage barista pro,i must have watched this video for like 60 time it is a great way to get in too the real espresso world,thank you so much your video very informative please continue to share your knowledge i wish to know about your work sooner before i get my bambino plus and please do a video on basket good not good where to get etc thanks again,so what i understood from this if i want and like tweaking i should go for rancilio or gaggia if i do not prefer modding and like milk sage is for me am i right,hi i have a question every one of my coffee is terribly sour every type of coffee is sour i tried change the temperature pressure and non pressure sieve different type of water i decalcified the coffee machine with the original preparation and also with vinegar i do not know where the mistake may be anymore can you please help me i am already desperate i own a delonghi dedica ec685 m coffee machine and a delonghi grinder kg521 m,the problem is the grinder,i am on my second miss silvia you get to understand and work with it foible this machine is leaking the main boiler gasket so now i have to take it apart to try and fix it i am not super impressed with the build quality and the temperature wandering but the shot are really good most of the time thank you for this video it make me want to strip the machine and fix it v spending money on a new one,i got the lelit anna with a built in pid and i m super happy with this one,picked up the gaggia classic over a year ago just after we watched this video i regret it it is a horrible inconsistent and highly temperamental machine one day it will make a perfect coffee and the next it will pour far too quickly before returning back to a functioning state another day later overall it requires far too much attention to be able to produce a decent shot,just found your channel very much enjoying the content i am just getting into coffee brewing since i left italy a few year ago kurig is not cutting it anymore so now i have to save to purchase an upgrade from my moka pot thanks for the moka pot series by the way very informative,subscribed,just saw a video for adding a dimmer switch to the water flow of the group head pretty cool little hack for about dollar10,these are all wildly different price here in the u lelit go for around dollar600 silva for dollar800 bambino for dollar300,coffee doe not equal mc2,your clueless italian are sexy you are not monica vitti espresso,omg is that an iwatch my hero,snob fest from 47 year old harry potter,i have a 1984 faema family and grinder from ebay for dollar100 that smoke your junk,thank you my friend,i would love to see a review of the solis barista perfetta,what can you say about gemilai 3200d,a a beginner getting into coffee and espresso machine is lile discovering a whole diff universe what can u suggest for people who want good espresso at home without all the upgrading thing,i pondered for a long time whether to get a silvia or not but in the end the price rose by around 100euros per year without any improvement implemented in the end i got a lelit grace pl81t for 500euros after a bit of waiting for a bargain this ha all the advantage of the anna pid timer user temperature controle preinfusion if wanted the only downside it share with the anna is the 57mm basket but i wa not ready to spend 200euros more for the pl91t and a 58mm basket,james please could you recommend the best value machine that also ha a built in grinder ideally one which is not huge because i do not have a massive amount of worktop space,3 53 no one drip tray,hi doe anyone know where can i get a decent 54mm basket for a delonghi,please review gaggia besana,can you please try the smeg manual espresso coffee machine,i have the delonghi and am looking at the rancilio the delonghi make much better coffee if you get a bottomless portafilter make a huge difference,hi why doe james never doe a video about superautomatic or even talk about that is a super auto so bad for making espresso,tv cafofinho that is an excellent choice,louis dorato agree after reading a ton i came to the same conclusion looking for my comfort and considering myself not a nerd i am going with the sage,i have had a superautomatic and returned it back after one week in my opinion they do not make good espresso,any chance of reviewing fully automatic machine,hi thanks for the great review i am new to coffee brewing well using a french press for year but pulled the trigger on the rancilo silvia in regard to the basket are they difference between brand and quality any specific one anyone can recommend,i think the silvia went way up in price,this delonghi machine is aweful lie lie lie e g 15 bar lol not even 4 bar done by morrons this company is dishonest,still waiting for that pressurized basket to hit the ground,get more steam from the gaggia by buying a 155oc steam thermostat lt dollar10,lelit is able to be modified too it is almost an old a design a the classic and silvia just ha been sold under different brand name over the year look out for quaha nemox imat lapavoni and others using this same machine template older version might need a 9bar opv installed but you can get these a a lelit spare and retrofit the steam wand can also be upgraded to one of the better one lelit us on some of their other model pid could be done too but there are lelit model with pid and it might be just easier to buy one of them,really wish you would included sage breville infuser,i have bambino and lelit i own the bambino first and to be honest i find my self use it more often it just easy early in the morning to pull a good espresso with the bambino,what do you think of the de longhi dedica deluxe espresso maker stainless steel,interesting but i found the spoon section a bit too pretentious to endure,by the way thanks a lot james a this video really helpt in my quest to buy a machine,also the barista max is bigger and heavier it still ha plastic but much le annoying,i have the breville barista max and it is a cheaper version of the sage i am actually quite happy with it and would be curious what you would think a with the cheaper price the quality price atio is then a lot different,hard time with de longhi dedica didnt had a coffee grinder and at the shop they grinded in different way and very rarely in the right granulation but after buying a grinder i found the right way and now i can enjoy a good esspresso and do not regret buying it,i have not looked that long but i am currently seeing the silvia for no cheaper than dollar830 gbp610 is that an availability thing for american customer or ha this machine gone up dramatically in price since this video released,and what do you think about delonghi elite experience please thank you,i have a delonghi dedica and it is real the low temperature issue but here some trick to improve espresso quality of light medium roasted coffee run two cycle of water to heat the portafilter and basket push the steam buttom and wait until the machine is ready then turn it off and wait 3 second turn it on again and it is ready to do an espresso but with hotter water the few extra degree are enough to make sweeter espresso if you are using a 18gr basket the preinfusion cycle in the machine is not suitable for that ammount of coffee so the lower part of the puck doe not get wet you could try to run two preinfusion cycle stopping the first one just after it finish and then run the complete cycle after waiting 5 second with that you will avoid channeling of the lower part of the puck,thanks,i have the dedica and push the steam button every freaking time i lock the filter in haha other than that i love it it is cheap and look great in my tiny studio apartment kitchen,thank you for the review bambino it is,smeg ha and almost identical machine to the deloghi same form same button location same design etc but are the innars the same also are those brand using the same chinese design and just brand it a their own do they produce the same result james could you compare espresso machine from different brand but that actually look remarcably similar but sold at different price point,just writing for everyone out there to know with the delonghi dedica you can control temperature low mid high auto shutdown time 9 min 30 min 3hrs water hardness and small large shot time,hey do you have a link for the basket upgrade you used,oh the other thing i had meant to comment on this video james you complained that you disliked that the water tank lid on the rancilio silvia doe not seat down properly i hate to break it to you but that is because you do not have the water hose properly in position,wait you get nervous pulling drip tray on coffee machine sheesh man be careful out there lol,i had the precursor to the lelia for several year and i think your review wa accurate it is a really nice machine especially for the price the downside though is that when it broke there wa nobody locally who wa willing to work on it the same could be said of all of these except the silvia and possibly the gaggia it is hard to get repair for the consumer brand especially the smaller one,i just had to comment the quality of your video and the level of detail you have added here is amazing thank you i wa looking into buying the gaggia classic so this ha been very helpful i did not think people actually do modification on their coffee machine this is very interesting thank you again,i am coming to this late and echoing other comment but i have had a silvia for decade i bought it just after college and after using that gaggia model you james used to sell at a friend is family is house and being disappointed both by the result and the friend is father pointing out that that quick discharge system into the drip tray wa a weak point he would replaced a couple of machine within warranty on which that valve failed and made a mess one presumes they have made that more robust by now but to be clear i am into modding my silvia ha a pid controller that i installed it is also easy to find vendor who pre install them last time i checked and i keep toying with the idea of better insulating the boiler and adding a pressure gauge which may be easier now than the last time i checked i got stopped by the need to drill through the metal exterior which i am fine with in principle i just do not own any drill bit that would do the job maybe i am especially rough or careless definitely careless once when i accidentally left it switched on with the steam wand open during a party and blew the boiler by letting it run empty but i have had to do some internal repair and part replacement that boiler swap wa the big one and i am not counting the necessarily frangible component the brew and steam wand gasket but i have had a couple of leaking seal along the copper pipe and in fact have just been using a french press lately a it is got one right now i am not sure that sort of maintenance requirement is a bad thing it seems about in keeping with what i know of professional machine especially professional machine also from rancilio from friend in the business i have never been a professional barista and they were modulo working with pressure vessel is inherently terrifying pretty easy repair that i did not think were excessively expensive,oh also since you brought up heat up time in the more recent under gbp1500 video my older rev than the one you reviewed here maybe they have gotten better maybe especially the pro is better silvia take about 30 minute to heat up so i have it connected through a wemo smart plug i switch that on from my phone when i wake up and by the time i have showered and come downstairs it is up to temp i mean except the brewhead portafilter and basket of course but that lengthy heat up time is why i will probably eventually get around to insulating the boiler better i am not always on the other side of a shower from wanting coffee some time that is just after dinner work great for me i do computer b for a living maybe a drag for others,thank you for the video i actually have a used red delonghi machine i bought for 30 euro the seller complained his coffee wa not strong enough and switched to mmacchinetta i always wanted the delonghi a it doe not take a lot of space and i generally think it is a beautiful machine with that red color it is by far one of the best looking on the market i grind the coffee using a heavy professional grinder and after a lot of tweaking i found the right lever of grounding and i must say that the coffee quality is not very far from what you will get in high end coffee shop an interesting discovery about grinding coffee the grinder i have had a broken funnel so i had to design and 3d print a new one after some time i realized that the bottom part of the funnel wa apparently too long and wa ground with the coffee is that the secret to my good coffee maybe,thanks,wow the price of the rancilio ha gone up like crazy it like 830 now,i own a dedica for almost a year now i wa not hapypy with the steam wand so i removed the outer part and only use the rubber inner part occasionally pressure spike would throw it into the milk but this can be prevented by putting a gardena sealing ring on it which fit perfectly overall i am very happy with it and for some strange reason setting i am happier with it than with the big commercial machine we have in the office a this one make very sour coffee despite 20percent robusta,modifying the portafilter basket differently or at all for each one make it le representative of the product at stock a bought by the typical consumer do not let the purism get in the way of an accurate review,that full disclosure about gaggia wa completely unnecessary working for a company in the past ha no bearing on anything neither doe really working for one currently unless you are a director or something i do hope that wa not some legal necessity,i have got the d longhi machine and i really like the shot i get to the point that i am very particular about my coffee when i am out because i get better coffee at home than a lot of coffee shop that may be because of the coffee that i buy too though i feel very vindicated about the milk side a that is one thing i really struggle with but i now feel a lot better about it,really enjoyed how you explain all in depth detail subscribed,hi james i know you probably get load of question like this but really in need of some machine buying advice wondering if you would be kind enough to help i am stuck between the gaggia classic pro lelit anna and the sage barista pro any advice would be greatly appreciated,can i echo this i am looking at moving into making proper espresso from a capsule machine james loved your video tasting every nespresso capsule i am looking at a sage barista pro and would love an opinion from someone i trust to speak honestly about the subject,i have just bought the delonghi for my mother in law for xmas have not opened it yet anyway after reading about a dozen comment in this comment section i found i wa using an internal gay man is voice is that odd,key to gagiga classic for steam is to start 10 sec before light came on you will get pressure all the time and temp will be constant,can you review a miele caffe machine,i have an old krups and have no idea how to pull espresso from it all i get it is like a small strong americano from it send help i want good espresso,here in canada the silvia is almost twice the price of the gaggia so it is a no brainer and there is a really simple workaround to get more pressure out of the wand you just start 10 second before the light come on i also upgraded to a vst basket and the ims screen which instantly improved the quality of my shot i will upgrade the portafilter at some point a i agree the handle feel cheap i think i am ready to get the opv mod it look easy enough to install it is a great little machine i am very happy with it,this is gon na sound silly but i work a a truck driver i am sick to my back teeth of paying between 3 and 4 pound for a costa or starbucks in the service every day nice a they are i feel that over gbp20 per week is unreasonable especially given that sometimes i will want 2 coffee so i bought a little stove and kettle and i have been making instant coffee it is much cheaper but far from ideal is there any way i can get closer to achieving the taste of good coffee myself in my truck without the ruinous expense or having to carry an espresso machine in my truck which i am not even sure i could power let alone have the patience to clean or carry to and from work cheer,i am interested to know what material the boiler are made from,rancilio silvia is fantastico d,what,so what are the specific mod that would be required for the gaggia why are these mod required and where do you get them thanks,very good review i would like to know if you have done a review on any automatic espresso machine,i have an 2004 gaggia classic may sell it and get a bean to cup,i wonder what machine do you use at home,would be interested to know your opinion on the sage duo temp pro my friend ha one and say it can compete with the dual boiler so long a you are not worried about milk drink,hey james have you looked into the lelit anna 2 now with pid wondering how it would stack up now,my advise go to watch the best espresso machine under gbp100,i had the silvia for about 10 year before substantially upgrading a year ago i am grateful to the silvia because it taught me a lot about pulling shot but that learning came about because it is a very tricky machine to use you really have to temperature surf on it and even then it can let you down occasionally i found it really tough to work with and even after year of using it and knowing it well i would occasionally get a very disappointing shot last year i upgraded to an ecm synchronika oh my spending that much money seemed like lunacy at the time i also went nut and got the expensive ceado grinder the j i think but it is made making coffee every morning not only a joy but a privilege i did not think i would say this but it is probably one of the best item of anything from car to fountain pen i have ever bought all to say that i am glad i started with the silvia and i am grateful to it for teaching me so much about what go into preparing and pulling a great shot but i am also really thankful that i never have to use it again would i recommend it a a first serious machine absolutely but that would also come with a warning you have to be dedicated and interested to learn how to prepare good espresso it will not do it for you like me you will also be extremely happy when you upgrade,what about a video of this machine upgraded to receive a rotary vane pump we have the breville cafe venezia and the vibration solenoid pump is annoying loud could plumbing in a different pump yield better result and then even push finer grind,what size vst basket did you use with the rancilio please james,the coffee from the delonghi would taste better using the basket it came with hence it ha not been judged fairly,why is there such a big difference in grind size if they are almost all 15bar,hi what are your thought on the bezzera hobby and ecm casa v a compared to this group,have all of these model skyrocketed in price over the last year they have all gone up 20 50percent,yes and they most likely will continue to increase breville recently cited increased supply chain cost and inflation,hi i begginer can you tell me what it different between espresso machine in price 500gbp and 1500gbp,at the end of the day this man must be so nervous,i have a rancilio silvia m full stainless model that i have had for several year along with the ranchilio doser grinder it is the first espresso machine i have owned that allows me to get proper milk for my drink mine is not modded the only change is an ims competition 58 mm basket a for espresso quality and consistency i temp surf using the steam wand wait 30 second after the machine reach temp and i get amazingly great tasting espresso consistently eventually i would like a rocket r 60v or a profitec pro but until they are in my price range i can think of nothing better than my ranchilio,older video so i would be shocked if no one ha mentioned this but to steam milk with the gaggia you need to turn on the steam button for about 22 second purge and then steam your milk do not wait for the steam light to come on if the steam light come on you have missed your opportunity because the heating element shuts off if you start steaming just before the light come on the heating element continues to do it thing while you steam your milk,conclusion 18 10,do not forget the most important reason for the purchase what machine will look the most impressive on the countertop,i have a via venezia thst wa gifted to me many year ago at time of purchase wa like dollar250 u dollar i do not know much about it and would love to see you use one and give more information and if it doe make a good cuppa they are old and you would need to find an old one,57mm portafilter is such a strange decision from lelit if they had gone with a traditional 58mm at gbp350 it could be the new gaggia classic more stable temperature cheaper with a pressure gauge i have a classic pro and have just bought a rancilio sylvia but if the lelit had a 58mm basket and a better steam wand it would have been a no brainer for me,how doe the sage barista express do among these,what basket wa used in the bambino plus,delonghi ec680 and ec685 work at 15bar pressure,so how much do you need to spend to get to get a machine with accurate temperature correct pressure and decent frothing out of the box,he always cut the video after he try the shot i wan na see his reaction to it taste ahhhhh,originally got the delonghi dedica and returned it about 2 week later for the breville barista pro i definitely do not regret that upgrade big difference between the two,would u review bezzera please sirr,the only guy i trust with anything related to coffee,i commend your beautiful speaking voice this video relaxed my fussy toddler to sleep in the first 5 minute thank you for giving my sing voice a break,i bought the lelit pl41tem right now so i am excited to try it out,i am more confused from watching so none of them are good no clear winner,seriously delonghi v lelit maybyyyyyy gaggia v lelit but not now ten year ago maybe and only classic series best prosumer is lelit good price also,i think it is a little unfair to upgrade the basket on all the others but leave the lelit with the standard one either test all of them with what is supplied or upgrade them all to a better basket otherwise it is a biased comparison,i feel like you missed a very important feature on the delonghi the drip tray ha a cute little face,the sound the basket make at 12 09 pure asmr,a friend of mine told me that the delinghi can be better by replacing the portafilter and basket with a bottomless portafilter and a non pressurised basket how true do you think this is i am trying to stay very budget friendly a i am only really after an okay espresso and not a proper coffee shop level one,hey man i stopped watching at about 1 30 so you are comparing 5 brewer where the difference in price cheapest most exp is 2 7x i can imagine mazda 6 v mercedes e350 in full spec and then you add modification to some of the brewer like that mazda v ford mondeo vignale but the ford ha tunned ecu get some education man,a question if anyone read this i bought the de longhi machine seemed like the perfect fit in term of it size and me not wanting to spend too much on an espresso machine i made a few espresso shot with the included pressure basket and portafilter and it seemed fine the coffee even had a nice crema but the basket wa too small i wa barely able to fit 10g of coffee into it yes i used a tamper a well now that my open bottom portafilter and a new basket were delivered i tried again even wa able to fit the 18g portion into it but the espresso now come out a bit too quickly and there is next to no crema i suspect that my grind is too coarse even though i used the minimal setting on my burr grinder the tamp seems fine and even though i am a novice anything else it could be,you can try increase the portion to 18 5g or 19g larger dose can restrict the flow a bit more which might give you a better result another tip is using a freshly roasted bean a possible from my experience recently off roast coffee ha significan notly slower flow rate than older coffee,i have got a delonghi dedica and have been happy with it until i started making coffee with a naked portafilter with an unpresurrised basket i also only have a blade grinder and had to seive the coffee but it wa inconsistent the next thing i knew i had a sage breville grinder pro and the result have been better i am now converting my utility room into a coffe haven or heaven and i have just ordered a gaggia classic pro,breville barista should be there i have had one for 10 year now never let me down a true machine,james drink 85 shot of espresso per day for our viewing pleasure,please james let u know what basket you use for the delonghi 51mm btw we dedica peasant mod the heck out of our machine but getting a descent basket seems to be the hardest part people are litteraly hammering ims basket into shape to make them fit,in fairness to the delonghi the brewing temperature can be increased please read the manual also before changing manipulating it portafilter give it a try with the manufacturer is set up this machine wa designed in italy and these guy do know how to make a good espresso i am very happy with this machine though i use it with pod,hello interesting video i am uncertain whether i should upgrade to these thinking gaggia classic or silvia i currently have a gen 2 francis francis x1 which ha a really good pid temp control measured temp and it is good and in any case adjustable inside on a pot i am really unsure about pressure on this or how to measure it or change it also it is a physically tiny machine with no space between head and tray and will only take 15g of coffee in the portafilter steaming is slow a well mine is also mega rusty so need a refurb but a strip down and re paint would fix that not sure it is worth the effort any opinion on the francis francis x1 v a gaggia classic or silvia think i am talking myself into a new machine,i did not know people take coffee this seriously maybe i will work a little harder at dunkin donut tomorrow,why doe lelit ha that stupid 57mm portafilter on this machine that is the only reason i am not purchasing it a that excludes so many of your standard accessory tamper leveler basket niche dosing cup etc,i got the lelit victoria which doe have a 58mm portafilter a well pid preinfusion pressure guage and the ability to change brew and steam temperature it cost more of course i do not like it water reservoir although it doe have a low level indicator or the steam knob which i seem to have to rotate a lot to get to full power it feel a bit flimsy compared to my previous faema family which died after 20 year,it is ridiculous you are not the only one they would sell so many of these with 58mm it would literally take over that section of the market in no time weird decision,did this guy just have 5 shot of esspresso for this video,you said the coffe would fall through 3 hole after modifyng portafioter with the dedica but in the video there were only the usual 2 liquid column falling from the two usual little hole i lost something,im not dumb to pay dollar500 dollar1000 for a coffee machine or dollar1500 for an ugly iphone so i paid dollar120 for an open box like new delonghi 685 and im very happy,guy and gal can you please tell me if anna 2 pid is significan notly better and could you please tell me if there are basket replacement that produce noticably better espresso,so i have had the gaggia for about six month it is a great basic machine that i can pull espresso from all day i have replaced the basket and the opv spring 10 minute and i have now bought dollar50 worth of component off aliexpress to install a pid to deal with the temperature fluctuation there is a whole series of video about temp surfing that i really can not be bothered with and it is all because of the very simple and basic thermostat in the machine the rancillio is the same but because the boiler is substantially larger the temp swing are slower i am hoping the pid will stabilize the temp on the gaggia a bit better do not get me wrong i just pulled a latte for my son which he love but i have had a few time where the steam heat just did not seem to be there if it still continues to bug me i may have to spring for the beastly steam of the rancilio another great thing about the gaggia and the rancilio is that they are endlessly repairable every part is replaceable and available and if you are at all handy you can do it yourself like i said i have watched a few video on installing a pid and i have now got the part for dollar50 the gaggia wa a dollar350 refurb from wholelattelove and it ha worked great so dollar400 buy a pid controlled espresso machine what is not to love btw here is a good example of the pid hack and the part list is in the description,filter basket over pressure valve spring and pid control can you please share the part number link to find these thanks,hi thanks for sharing to everyone i need a new expresso machine and i want something reliable i like the idea of modifying and repairing is there anything elso than install a new filter and a pid control,hey i saw a new lelit anna with pid and temp control also and would be great to do a revisit on that i started with a simple de longhi ecp 33 21 similar to the dedica but bigger and without dose control and now i want more your fault but thanks,i have owned and use most of these i short in real world use dedica pull a fantastic shot the rancillio wand is easily installed on it and would be a must if you want latte art a the milk texture is a massive let down otherwise you also have to descale the bast rd thing every 3 week the gaggia is a good machine no it crap it good when you modify the hell out of it the sage will produce milk quality that you could not dream of doing yourself within a year of practicing it rarely need a descale industrial filter shot is weaker than the dedica but still good purging the wand is a bloody nightmare to do without running a wand cleaning cycle into your milk no replacement part once the warrenty is up it go in the bin if it break,is the ponte vecchio lusso any good,wow i have no clue what to do now lol i love coffee i have evidently been drinking it wrong my whole life however i would love this lad to pour me a coffee one day i bet it would be euphoric,how about a under 250 video,which machine do you have,you should mention how much water each tank hold thats very important for me,yo guy tea bag and some milk cost around gbp3 instead,after watching this i am glad i enjoy my instant every morning so i can get on with my day without a sense of overwhelming pretentiousness rendering me unable to move,quick delonghi dedeica tip 1 the drip try can be removed for taller cup 2 keep single or double button pressed until desired water dispensed it remembers it for next time 3 hold the steam button for 10 second to enter setting mode press single cup button now choose temperature single cool double warm steam hot,i made a list of all the setting and posted to one of the delonghi vids here it is again though might be useful for setting menu press and hold steam button for 10 second button 1 temperature low med high button 2 water hardness soft med hard button 3 stand by 9m 30m 3h steam dial button 1 reset steam dial button 2 no function steam dial button 3 descale normal function press and hold button 1 to set water amount delivered on single cup press and hold button 2 to set water amount delivered on double cup press button 3 for steam,the expedition great thanks for the reply wa just wondering since you had to hold the steam button to set it,harvey it is the temperature of the espresso water i have mine on hot 3rd button i have not seen anywhere that mention the steam wand temperature,the third tip on temperature is that the temperature for the steam wand or for the espresso water,i am impressed at the composure of a man who drink coffee for a living great review nonetheless,i am surprised at the composure of a man who drink coffee for a living great review nonetheless,i think anna anita is the best overall machine simply because it is not that expensive and there is a community around it a well also it give nice and stable result out of the box while other machine need to be tweaked,i have had a rancillio sylvia for over 15 year other than routine cleaning it is still going strong,,so this is a video i have come back to more than a few time great job there mr hoffman so asking everyone here anyone ha got the sage bambino plus i am really interested in some opinion about the espresso result,i am interested too i have 10 year old nespresso that need replacing i like coffee and drink 2 3 cup a day a doe my husband do i jump to bambino plus or should i spend extra and get the dual boiler,james i need a video about something i can get between 500 1500 with pid i feel like i need it,would the gaggia classic pro or any of these machine be built well enough to use multiple time a day for a sidewalk coffee business,hello james i have enjoyed watching your video for a few year now i appreciate your insight review and sometimes very nerdy take on all thing coffee watching this review video make me wonder if you have ever used a starbucks barista home espresso machine and what your thought would be on that i am particularly curious because i have one but also because they seem to be pretty available yet i do not see many review on the machine maybe because the machine wa released 20 year ago,by buying the sage could i help to fund a tyrannical communist regime,well the test of the bambino plus is invalidated if you are not using pre infusion and shot volume control especially if you are using the non pressurized filter if the shot wa not bad without these then it could be great by accessing these vital feature,question why would you pull an expresso the pour it into another glass leaving all the crema behind and not pour it into said glass in the first placw i used to buy coffee at a cafe near my work place that did that and id knock it back every time they did that to me it took me a little while to realise i wa just getting a dishwater coffee when they did that,you should revisit the delonghi but then just use it the way it come out of the box basically you removed part from the machine the plastic insert and replaced part the basket for all we know you ruined the thing,with the delonghi you can change temperature in 3 step and the extraction time by keep holding the button i drilled open the pressure hole and also removed the plastic item and i am quite contempt so far with it for the money really good,default temperature setting is medium,thank you for a very informative review i have a further question however if i want to get to the next level of coffee experience from my compact breville nespresso will any of these reviewed machine do the trick or i will not see much difference with say a delonghi,you should list your grinder in the description,your video are incredible interesting i wa wondering if you can express your opinion regarding bean to cup full automatic machine and make a comparison like delonghi magnifica s style thank you,what about the inner part quality of tubular material,ok here is the topic it is not best under dollar100 or best under dollar500 it is what is the least expensive machine that can consistently pull a good shot of espresso is it the breville bambino the gaggia classic some other,the lelit anna is so much more expensive than he say,i have heard in review the cheaper delonghi will break after several month or so anyone own one,very good and informative video,one thing overlooked here is that some of these machine take a while to heat up 10 20mins for the rancilio for example for those who want espresso first thing in the morning and are sometimes in a rush this can be important i think the dedica only take a minute or so to heat up,f man in my country the gaggia is almost 900 pound,any thought on the ascaso steel uno or ascaso dream is there any real downside to having a 57mm basket can anyone suggest a good 57mm basket nano coating,simply quality of espresso quality of milk frothing with the requisite skill i do not care how much of a dent it would create in the pavement if dropped out of a window,thats it send this stuff to ave we need to know the build quality material quality a well a engineering iq that went into these thing,unfortunately you invalidated your test by swapping out the standard equipment so you did not actually test with the machine presented pity,james i will not be using any modification james two second later i have modified everything,great video a always a small comment is that on the delonghi model you featured i believe you can programme the temperature and the length of the shot,love love your channel what do you think of automatic espresso machine i am thinking about one for the daily convenience and to save counter space,james what do you think to the bezzera hobby machine cheer,afternoon have you given away the gaggia,i know raj beadle i live close to where they are based and used to take my gaggia classic to them for servicing,bottomless bottomless from amazon only the inlay,what do you think of the quick mill silvano evo espresso machine,rancilio all day,i came across your site only last week sept 2021 but glad for your comment i had 3 saeco machine through starbucks in the 1990s and super disappointed that they only lasted an average of about 3 5 year for the buck dollar500 600 at the time not okay they performed okay and i wa trained by a starbucks employee who had her own home saeco and i quickly learned with superior bean to make a super latte most of the time but only lasting that long even with de scaling solvent lemon juice etc i simply gave up on them all and now on my 2nd aeropress that is easy in every way the first one lasted over 5 year before the press gave out james would you recommend owning another machine even if still at the same price range of 500 buck glad for any input bruce,someone know the solis barista perfetta lost between it and the bambino,a good grinder to match one of these machine a niche zero is out of budget for this tier but i can not find good alternative browsing on your channel some machine like the lilit anna have related version with an in built grinder for around euros100 more it is worth purchasing,i love your video and this is among the best thank you this wa very informative,great review my gaggia classic is on it way out after 7 year of hard service and it wa far from new when i bought it leaning toward the rancilio for a change up however the gaggia ha served me well decision decision grazie,you forgot to mention heatup time delonghi 20 sec and the others,great review througouh and straight to business thanks for the video,how do you feel about the mr coffee espresso machine or the one step espresso,ended up getting a gaggia for cheapish a a refurb and not two month later it got replace with a breville dual boiler,thanks because of this video i bought a slayer 1 group,youtube auto played this video after the 299gbp aldi machine video and it is funny seeing how many people there clearly unfamiliar with james call him a snob for roasting that affordable machine when here he is generally reasonably positive about the delonghi that is like 100gbp cheaper than that aldi disaster,i own an ascaso inox duo 8 year old broken now what would be your choice the lelit or letting the ascaso get fixed same money roughly thanks,great video a always what you say about graef pivalla thanks,lelit is the best,the delonghi actually ha a hidden temperature setting in the menu,rancilio look repairable a it look like it is made of serviceable part a someone who repair thing this would be the machine i would gravitate towards and gaggia too actually,i have had a rancilio for 20 year and can confirm your impression it is both reliable and repairable i have added a pid about 5 year ago and replaced the pump last year which wa trivial,brother jim i have learned so much from you thank you,on my second gaggia classic since 2000 i find that they are very variable with anything but illy ground which is why i use ese pod for an easier life my favourite daily being lucaffe red however if you want something to last i gave my first one away at a decent price go gaggia because if anything break it is replaceable and relatively easy to pull apart agree about the portafilter remark they seem to have got a bit cheaper in quality since the early one,i have an older delonghi with hose to the water tank and i ended up filling the tank using external device instead of removing the tank,would it be possible to create a video going over setup recommendation for someone who is a complete beginner and not rich enough to afford a really nice machine a starter pack if you will,i bought the sage bambino a many people reviewed this a one of the best machine out there i would be interested on what you said about changing basket,i just bought the sage bambino plus on the strength of your review it wa probably my best ever buy of kitchenalia every cup is equal to or better than a decent coffee shop such a step up from those instant latte sachet i have been using for month,looking for replacing my nespresso friend talked to me about model of gaggia or jura with grinder le than caddollar1k your thought thx,i have a delonghi for several year already initially i had same experience what you mentioned i pressed button acccidently when holding machine but now i have no problem with that in setting it is possible to set higher water temperature this is what i did plus before shot i preheat basket always this machine also ha big advantage that you can put practically any size cup underneath the spout and even bigger if you remove drip tray so in other word i like it delonghi ha best price performance ratio in my opinion,davor hrg probably just run water through the portafilter without coffee to heat it up just run two espresso program or a double take the portafilter out wipe it dry put coffee in and proceed a usual,i have recently bought delonghi and do not want to go chasing more and more expensive machine although it is appealing can you clarify please how you pre heat the basket,how about reviewing low watt bean to cup machine or similar we tried using our delonghi eletta from home but on our narrowboat and it threw up an error we suspect it wa a non sine wave inverter issue we are missing a decent cup the easy way,i do believe this man hate when his drip tray overflow onto his countertop,i did not understand anything,you may be an honest explainer of coffee machine but the way you deliver the message you find fault in every machine i do like constructive criticism but you end up with much of pessimism,wilson david so go watch those video,adam first of all my first word wa his honesty i rather listen to many coffee grower and the local instead of coffee machine maker,not really he being honest about the quality of espresso you get from these machine the reality is you need a lot of money for good home espresso,appreciating that you took the most popular lelit and gaggia are the most popular in greece also,have a silvia absolutely love it for all the reason you cite temperature is easily it is weak point and the most commonly modded,how much are you spilling that you are so concerned with the drip tray overflowing,sorry i could not live with the gaggia those switch are right out of a 1978 austin maxi mk2 not something i want to be reminded of a i brew my morning coffee,i do not understand the brew basket situation what is different compared to the one the delonghi for example,would be handy to measure pressure at the group there would some interesting number to discover,hi james considering a oscar ii for mostly espresso and milky drink would you recommend any of these in the video rather than the oscar ii,i have bought the silvia based on this video thank you mr h,i do not even like espresso why do i keep watching these video,i have had the delonghi dedica for 5 year now it performs and hold up very well it is also extremely simple to use and clean,year ago i had a krups like the one james trashed in the sub 150 test it got trashed and i moved up to a gaggia the gaggia failed the spouse acceptance test way too fiddly she bought me a nespresso and dumped the gaggia now we are both doing pour over coffee i miss the gaggia i wish i had known about moding but that wa before i worked with a team who controlled a technivorm with a raspberry pi and one weekend replumbed and pided a cafebar machine,hello from el salvador i am being offered a used a few year in a lawyer office 5 6 cup a day look pristine saeco intuitia for dollar199 usd including a few extra cup metal jug and the like i just want affordable home morning espresso push button get coffee a you can imagine i can get pretty good coffee almost anywhere here but i do not know how decent is the brew on the intuita the guy say he can bring it and i can try it with my coffee but i do not want to make him come if the thing is gon na sucking i have read extremely mixed review online he just got a fancy jura that is why he is replacing it i used my first fully automatic espresso machine in my first job 2009 a thermoplan black and white and i am sure this will not compare but my other option budget for me is dollar300 rn are not amazing either,which 50 basket did you use for the delonghi portafilter i guess i need to upgrade my machine a little,that lelit anna is not dollar350 no more,well james maybe wa a seller for gaggias but he definitely sold me on the sage i would definitely sum up my interest in an espresso machine the way he summed up the sage a good machine for a beginner with not much interest in diving deep into mod or very specific skill thank you for the help,me too,excellent review i really enjoy following your review overall i have previously owned the rancillio silvia amp i believe your take on it is spot on very similar experience and i also modified the machine,amazing thank you so much for making this content you are greatly appreciated,how about machine up to 200gbp,james love your channel finally someone who pay attention to detail just purchased the breville bambino plus in oz mainly for space saving reason on a boat quite disappointed in the quality of the shot using excellent bean from a quality roaster that produce superb shot on other machine such a the breville infuser also using single wall basket not the silly high pressure dual wall basket that come with the machine here in australia the measured brew temperature is only 72 c a measured by an accurate to 0 1 c thermocouple on a fluke digital multimeter and out of the box it produced a double shot volume of 35ml which can be adjusted up to 60ml at least the pump pressure is obviously much lower than 9 bar leaf the puck dripping wet after the shot a weak anemic crema and no ability to push through a finer grind i e it choke easily but it is cute and doe good milk,when you say 18 in amp 38 out are you referring to gram of coffee my basket will not hold 18g anything over about 11g is spilling over and any over about 13g can not be tamped below the ridge of the basket obviously i am just beginning my espresso journey,i have used a delonghi dedica that i wa given for free for about a year now and yes the milk wand only doe bubbly frothed milk and would turn over half my jug into non liquid by the end however to get around this i accidentally lost the silver tip cover one day and used the simple rubber tip underneath and it made very silky milk now the opposite is true and you can not froth milk with the tip so if you need both for your recipe then you have switch between the two,nice review btw you put the drip tray grid the wrong way round on the lelit if you put it the other way it look way better cause there s no gap anymore and also it s not wobbling around etc i ve got the lelit anna but with pid pl41 tem for a while now i can really recommend it and i really think it s especially good for beginner cause you always have some kind of visual feedback and also control in the end it s the same process a with a machine without pid trial and error but it s le of a guessing game cause you can see the temperatur in the kettle and can easily work your way up to a good shot by adjusting the different parameter grind temperatur time etc i got mine new for 390euros i think you get good value for your money also one important thing is the spare part availability it s really easy to get lelit spare part so you could potentially have the machine for a whole life i guess if a part your delonghi is broken well you can throw it away a much a i love it here are some con for those of you that consider buying the lelit like james already mentioned the steam isn t a powerful and also pretty watery but with a small single circle mashine you ll never get that good steam but it seems lile the rancilio doe better here the water tank it ha a strange odor to it after a while and the opening is pretty unhandy do get water in without spilling and also almost impossible to clean properly the new one have a better tank with a big opening i think almost every anna owner changed the tank into a glas vase or another plastic tank i did cut a bigger hole in it you can only see the water level in the tank from one side unhandy if you need to place it next to a wall the portafilter doesn t slide in too well so you got ta hold it while putting it in o think that d different from machine to machine and i guess it s because the tolerance while building aren t that high on this part the first two machine i ordered were scratched really badly in this area the drip tray itself is a bit wobbly cause of the design the drip tray grid doesn t habe enough hole in it too much metal cover if you wan na steam in the drip tray after steaming mill it really make a mess cause of the watery steam hitting the metal grid u get used to it and either steam in a glass or a towl or place it directly above a hole the top part aka cup warmer doesn t really get that hot the tamper it come with is just a cheap plastic thing u can t use the single espresso portafilter don t know the proper name somehow me and a lot of other people can t get good shot with it but that s also a common problem not only with lelit sorry if my grammar etc is wrong i m from germany,hi james thanks for the video very informative and proof that facebook and youtube is listening to me a it know i want an espresso machine my current home coffee set up is limited to a mokka pot a i am the only coffee drinker in the house but it is frustrating because i love cappuccino and would really like to be able to make them at home my question to you would be where should i start zero experience and zero equipment and an absolute max budget of around gbp500 the machine that keep coming up when i look online is the sage barista express a being a sort of all in one do you have any better recommendation would separate set ups be better,wish you could show u how to work tweak under the hood of a gaggia mine is from about 1999,could you test sage the barista express d,anyone know what basket he is putting in the bambino is portafilter i know he is using vsts but i can not find any 54mm vst basket and the bambino ha a 54mm portafilter,they come with both pressurised and none pressurised in the box,i have had the bambino plus for around 1 5 year i have been always using a naked portfilter i confirm that it is great for making cappuccino you really need to be very good at making the foam to beat the automated setting now i am buying a dedica for a kitchen where space is a key selection criterion,watched one coffee video now here i am,you can change the temperature in the delonghi dedica,doe no one like the smeg coffee machine can not seem to find many review about it anywhere is it just nice looking and doe not make good espresso,can you do the best bean to cup coffee machine,this really need a stronger presence in recommendation so hard to find any decent information contrasting the different model,frankly i wish i knew what a perfect shot of espresso tasted like i have a nicer espresso machine but i do not know how my product compare to a standard i know i enjoy my drink but i imagine i am missing out on something,do you often buy espresso at coffee shop you like if you do and the barista is experienced and ha a good palate then you can set that a the standard of a balanced espresso,i got a replacement sage bambino plus a couple of month ago and they now come with both the pressurised and non pressurised basket out of the box which wa a pleasant surprise or slightly annoying a i would bought one already depending on your point of view,any thought on the dollar699 breville barista express,i had the delonghi we had planned on moving into a tiny house and i gave away my breville 6 month later and i store bought a breville the delonghi wa absolute crap it started leaking water about a month in and i pretty much stopped drinking coffee a it wasnt enjoyable went over to my aero press for age,average picker maybe the newer model are not a good quality i would always thought a delonghi would be amazing but the inside wa just cheaply made,weird i have never had a single issue with mine it is been getting used at least 3 to 5 time a day for over five year now,if i wa teaching someone to steam milk for the first time very kind of you to offer i am free next tuesday james let me know,there is a great lelit anna 44temd i think with a pid and it s slightly different i am torn between a factory installed pid on the lelit and the rancio silvia v6 and modding it with a pid mod but i am not too keen on that however i mod guitar all day electronics everything modding is great but it is steep learning curve with something new and i do not really wantto buy the silvia v6 and kill it destroy and it become inoperable i do not do mod on thing that are too expensive guitar aside,delonghi dedica intro 3 22 pulling shot 8 48 steaming milk 15 24 conclusion 15 55,i will love to have the espresso machine,what about the oster primalatte 6701 i need reference about that machine please,what opinion about something like cecotec cafelizzia 790 pro,what is better the silvia or breville sage express both about the same price,sylvia gang i got a used one for really cheap and am enjoying it immensely,hi james thanks for a very informative look at these machine just bought a delonghi dedica before seeing this video i would like to change the basket to a non pressurised one can you recommend a good one for this machine so many cheap one around but i would like a good one cheer,worthless while throwing the basket off screen what a mood,beyond just this video i ordered a ranchillio silvia with pid i am looking forward to learning how to do milk with it and not the cheat wand that wa on my delonghi ec702 and i am glad i have the pid so i do not have to fuss with temp surfing a much thanks for the inspiration james to step up my game from a dollar200 machine now to find an affordable grinder that wont disappoint,any idea where i can get a non pressurized vst if possible basket for the bambino plus,thank you for the detailed overview just bought a gaggia new classic could you advise me what in particular need to be modded to improve the espresso quality,i love my silvia and have had good result temperature surfing which is not difficult once you understand how the temperature control system work but a year ago i added a pid which take the machine to another level the pid is a worthy investment,what do you think of the lelit anna with pid did changing the filter bring a noticeable improvement,james full dislosure i bought this from a homie the build is great,exactly the video i wa looking for thank you i used to have an older lelit that i ordered from new jersey before pid and pressure gauge were included and i agree with your assessment it took me a lot of dialing in of the grind and timing to get a decent espresso using the stock portafilter i never really achieved the flavour i wa seeking but it wa not bad either,i am currently still using a nespresso and it is nice but i would like some stronger coffee and a little le bitter i would be interested in buying a gaggia classic pro and i would like to mod it a well but i would like to know what grinder to pair it with or perhaps whether i should buy pre ground coffee until i am ready to buy a really good grinder,the gaggia grinder is a good choice hold the portafilter and is able to grind sufficiently fine which is a big influence on the shot quality usually around 6 or 7 on their scale get the grind about right to use in my classic,i love to see your true devotion to espresso did you hear anything about the isomac giada and or maverick these seem decent device a well that deserve attention,i have had my rancilio silvia for eight year and it still delivers espresso every day at a reasonable high quality i am partly convinced the reason i have not upgraded my espresso setup yet is because it is the silvia granted a dual boiler would be nice due to the elimination of the waiting time between shot and steaming milk if one is new at espresso brewing and milk based espresso drink i really think the silvia is a good choice it punishes the user for not doing thing properly and it can be a frustrating a motivating for learning the basic my machine wa around gbp400 at purchase 3 999 danish kr,high carb rider yes and that is actually my only upgrade regarding the machine my grinder is nothing special just the mahlk nig vario,do you use a vst basket i have just got a silvia and still struggling to get a 30g shot for longer than 12 second i hope my new grinder will be able to grind my coffee finer to help with this,i wonder if any of these machine work well serving 30cups per day really need your thought on this,can you please review the illy machine,i have the delonghi dedica a my first machine with unpressurized portafilter and i feel like while i am getting decent shot out of it it is really capping the potential of my shot,great review but i wish we could see the texture of the crema of each machine during the review a well,i trust you were aware that you can select one of three temperature on the delonghi dedica you may have tested on too low a temperature the other advantage is that you can adjust the size of the automatic shot i am not sure the same applies to any of the other machine lastly i always use a fine grind using the square same brand grinder and with no problem have been very happy with the result the machine is supposed to have a 25 bar pressure which i believe is standard across most machine i would be very interested in your comment i would also like to see a critique of the various coffee you can buy at around gbp10 kg on amazon especially those labelled a italian espresso from italy to see which you think are good i like your channel for all the interesting coffee subject you cover so keep them going,i have a pressure filter basket how where can i replace it with one of the one you use,i have owned and then resold some of your 100 500 and 1500 pound contender and have frankly struggled with all of them even now when i only make single espresso and never drink milk my wastage to enjoyment ratio is around 10 1 there is no solution a almost all the coffee place around here are a bad a i am at home i wish i could not tell the difference but i know what a nice shot look feel and taste like the sheer expense is exhausting,i like the general look of the lelit but the button and the use of lucinda handwriting a the typography on the pressure gauge really put me off thank god they did not use comic sans only one of these i have had a go with wa the rancilio and wa straightforward to use,should do something in between 250 or so,i have got a gaggia classic in white i think build in the 90 and a there are some frustrating aspect of it water tank removal could be easier temperature and pressure are sometimes a hit or miss it is also easy to get fixed a the part used are being made for decade and that is both cheaper and more environmently friendly than buying a new machine,i have had a gaggis classic for ten year now have been a bit frustrated with the service support in the uk they are not the most professional or customer focused i have also struggled to get milk froth at the right texture spent many hour trying to fix my technique but am now convinced i am getting the best out of the unit and still not getting the texture of a coffee shop would i buy a new one maybe but definitely open to other option around this price point,good night can you indicate ne a coffee machine that make a good nespresso for sale on amazon or the 3 best machine thank you,i wa more hoping to find something around gbp200 if anyone could recommend,quick question why is it that the sage duo temp plus is a 100euros cheaper than the bambino plus when it seems a much better machine at least in the eye of someone who know absolutely nothing about them in portugal,what portafilter basket did you switch to on the sage bambino have one arriving on thursday and would like a better basket too,would be concerned with longevity lot of report of espresso machine breaking down after a short time of use i only want espresso not interested in latte,i have a rancilio epoca st1 and some time i miss my gaggia new baby dose pided,i have the breville barista is that bambina pretty much the same my issue with the barista is i want to do a large milk jug in one go and the pressure is too weak so it take forever would i be better off with the rancilio,same question,i have a confession i sneered at mr hoffman after my first exposure to his channel where he reviewed a gbp300 bean to cup machine from aldi around about that time i had moved from instant coffee to a pod machine and wa enjoying the novelty of all the random flavour option that they offered i had the opportunity to upgrade pretty cheaply to an espresso machine when a friend of mine bought one a part of a return pallet deal from amazon he had bought in an auction house it is a delonghi bean to cup and ha a built in grinder so it is a bean to cup machine it wa effectively a new machine but with one small crack in the water tank which i replaced for gbp20 it is a bit more of a faff than instant or pod coffee but omg the difference really is remarkable i do not think i will ever be a sniffy a james but now i do appreciate that there is more to it than most people realise now i look forward to trying exotic roast and i am enjoying and appreciating coffee more added benefit is that i am generating a regular pile of puck to mix into my compost bin to add a little nitrogen unfortunately the only downside is that i love it so much i can now hear my heart beating all day and i am down to around two hour of sleep a night,here an idea for you do a super automatic version of this video like a bean to cup do some side by side tasting and milk and do they stack up against a more manual approach answer question like can you consider bean to cup specialty coffee for the home ease of use and other question that my come being a coffee nerd i assume i know the answer but i would find it interesting video,you havent got any breville coffee machine probably the best out there under 500 easily ive owned 5 brevilles in last 12 year,i own the delonghi dedica it a decent machine for beginner especially if you can get it on sale got it for 130euros and your kitchen is tiny it make nice espresso using darker roast which i prefer anyway but just a you predicted the result with ligher roast are not great at all,i lost it when he said he had upgraded his spoon collection i have not tasted the coffee from these machine but this doe seem excessive i have tried posh coffee bean and the taste from my stove top espresso maker bear no relation to the description i have also tried home roasted and ground coffee from a colleague and i wa unimpressed maybe i need to get a natty hair style and glass to appreciate it,this wa such an interesting video because i have actually owned three of the model you tested i love a good coffee but i do know that it is also a very personal thing my first machine wa the delonghi dedica which i absolutely loved i loved the taste of my coffee wa great and i always felt like i wanted to go home and make one instead of getting one at a cafe i own a hair salon and i bought the rancilio for my business it wa an amazing machine but i agreed with you on every point i will also add that the base of the machine around the drip tray rusted completely rendering the drip tray completely useless a i could not pull it out to empty it my current home machine is the bambino plus and i loved it so much i replaced the rancilio at work with another bambino plus honestly for a very decent home machine i think it is absolutely the best value for money and i love the self detecting milk temperature feature i recommend it to everybody but that is just my opinion thanks for a great video,bambino is only good if you like to waste money,p always fancied a rocket just a bit on the pricey side,thank you for this i had a breville for 10 year when it finally died friend bought me a nespresso machine but there is something lacking and when james mentioned nestle issue i researched and decided i will use my chemex and french press for now until i get my hand on a new proper machine breville it may be again,camjkerman fellow student here i had a similar thought process and always loved the thought of having proper espresso at home and start getting into this bubble got my dedica for 180euros and for me personally it feel just a nice a getting a 5euros coffee at say starbucks or equivalent obviously i am nowhere near being an espresso enthusiast nor can i compare to any other machine a the dedica is my first but i keep enjoying it every morning and considering the price tag of the other machine in this video i feel like it the best machine out there if you are on a tight budget and in my case have a tiny kitchen d definitely recommend this machine if you are like me wanting something better than the average student is coffee and get into espresso next step is definitely investing in a proper grinding setup,loved reading your thought on the dedica i am a student and made the awful awful awful mistake of trying espresso for the first time on my family is home coffee setup 2 day before moving into my student accommodation the dedica is price is a big draw and if people say they can get good espresso with it then i guess i might a well get one edit i picked up a used dedica for gbp65 a little while ago in perfect working order but with some cosmetic damage the espresso it make is really quite good for the money once you replace the portafilter and basket but if you use espresso ground coffee from union coffee you need to run a very high dose i am running a 20g dose and getting 38g out in 28 which taste pretty good,a someone who drink almond milk and oat milk how well can you even use those alternative milk in the same way that you would use whole milk for a latte cappucino,good question many of u can not drink milk,any thought on the little guy coffee machine i would value any opinion you may have no thought i will go and buy one thanks,true the rancilio is a little tricky but for me it is the real deal most of the time once you have figured out the timing for me 20 30 sec after the heating light went off with the rancilio lucy i got a pretty good grinder included rocky i guess so i am happy with these one a pid would be nice to test out though never did so far,3 52 how did no one talk about the lil face in the drip tray haha,i am dying for a review of the ascaso range of machine i would love to hear your thought in practice a i have been considering buying one of them for age but then i keep watching your video review on other machine and my mind wanders to those thought the dream series the pid machine etc,1 for reviewing the ascaso lineup wa drawn in a a novice by the dream pid but then looking into the steel duo i would love to get an expert look at the detail of this apparently still little known manufacturer,hey what about the quality of the espresso you pulled from these,i am sorry but how is this a comparison more then half of the machine where modified you need to grade them a they are i own a lelit,could you tell me where you bought your scale thanks,silvia all day i have had mine for over 10 year 1 or 2 espresso a day still going strong except for the plastic chrome cover on the brew head look fine without it,anyone got any idea what basket he would have used in the sage just the standard sage one or is there something better available for 54mm,i have owned my racilio silvia for about 17 year and it still make the best espresso about 8 1 2 year ago i took the boiler apart to remove calcium buildup which made it pull a new i have replaced the steamer valve and the pump motor once in that time what other consumer product can you do that to i also have 2 rocky jr grinder for caf and decaf and they are also easy to service unless you want fancy doodad that will fail in a short time these are perfect for the home imho,just test them a they are,the problem is your used to much higher priced machine and im not willing to spend that kind of money or put in the amount of time grinding my own bean ect prehaps the wrong channel to be watching a review on a you can not like the machine at these price point a they will not have the feature you like,i have a lelit victoria a step or 2 up from the anna and i am pretty unimpressed i have managed to dial in a pretty good shot but i am looking at upgrading issue are water reservoir is small and there is no external indicator to see water level so you can run out of water mid shot the steam valve is a round knob that you turn about 10 time to fully open a handle with ball valve would be much easier it is loud i had to put foam on grate mount because it rattled like crazy the stem pressure seems quite poor there is no preset for volume or even time of shot i used to have a lelit grinder which wa absolute rubbish it eventually clogged up and would not grind and i ended up getting a cheapo breville which is infinitely better it took 2 hour to open up the lelit grinder and clean the burr to make it ok to sell it should not be that hard to clean something which requires regular maintenance the breville ha very easy access to burr automatic dosing and a no spill hopper the lelit had dosing but you had to hold the griphead against a button for the duration the coarseness adjusting wa also very bad a there wa no visual indicator,we have had a delonghi dedica e680r a our daily office machine since october 2015 make between 6 10 coffee is a day and ha never missed a beat and is still working fantastically used approx 260 day per year x 7 cup x 5 5 year 10 010 cup of coffee awesome machine,do not know why i finished the whole video owning a nespresso krup,temperature surfing on the silvia is a must checking pressure and adjusting also a both wander around a bit but it is a great machine,hi james i do enjoy your content newbie here i do not understand why some espresso machine produce up until 20 bar pressure whereas the ideal pressure at the group head in around 9 bar what i know is throughout the process a the pump pressure is 20 bar or le it will be around 9 bar for example at the group head am i right,i own the gaggia and a stated i did add a pid to fix the pressure and steam a it is also controlled by the pid i did also change the opv spring but the biggest problem i had with it yes had expecting a decent de1xl in the mail is the space underneath the brewhead not enough room for cup and scale so i opted for the bottomless portafilter to rectify this i love the machine but excited to get my decent i have uploaded 1 video on pulling a shot on it,the silvia is the one i bought in 2010 11 with a matching grinder it is in the shed after 6 month wasted my money,hello james i own a rancilio silva and rocky for 8 year both are still going strong wish it had a pid i just make do with temp surfing like your channel just subscribed looking forward to learning more,f a n c y m a n,modified rancilia is great,i wonder if he is all jittery and energetic after all of those shot o,when you finally get to shit on your bos for that 8dollar h,bought dedica in 2017 best decision ever,i am buying a santos n 75 expresso machine dose any one have an idea about it is performance many thanks,18 10 product summarized,i got the delonghi steaming milk is a pain in the as and it doe not help that i am a beginner i love the machine though sits neatly on my kitchen counter and give me better coffee than i otherwise would have had the problem with the other machine for me is that where i live all of them are closer to 600 pound the delonghi is better at around 230 pound,abueloraton i know i am going to get a non pressurized filter soon they are available here expensive but available,dhruv1223 the dedica is a pressurized basket machine which mean it doe not do a full extraction of flavor it is the equivalent to a nespresso machine for ground coffee of one is choice,abueloraton i will probably be in a better position to buy a more expensive machine by then,your pump will die after 3 year having the dedica sort of revealed to me how fake of a machine it wa anyways it pump died already i graduated from dedica,the delonghi wa the first espresso machine i had before i upgraded to a sage dual boiler about 4 month later wa a great wee machine cost about gbp110 new at the time i bought a second portafilter and chopped the bottom of it to make it a naked portafilter i also replaced the basket with a mrcoffee 20g basket and in that configuration it wa making great extraction milk foaming wa a pain and i could not knock the basked clean so it wa a bit fiddly to clean compared to the sage db the sage is coffee grind needed to be a lot finer to get the right type of extraction,why do not you use the basket provided rather than saying i do not rate this basket and then proceeding to use your expensive commercial basket that no one watching this because it aimed at a demographic with gbp500 will have to do a true test you need all correct variable and you are messing with this how come,would you recommend the lelit over the gaggia or is gaggia the way to go for that price,i have a lelit victoria it ha a 58 portafilter and a pid pretty happy with it the water tank is even more annoying than for the one you have but pretty good machine i had a silvia the drip tray is way to shallow and the machine tends to rust from the water coming out during back flush however i owned one for 10 year did not change a thing and then sold it to someone who wanted to put a pid on it,you are never taking the gaggia,summary,had my gaggia for year and still going strong put in a brass grouphead better shower screen better portafilter amp basket changed the steam valve and upgraded to the 2019 steam wand changed the pressure to 9bar it is a pretty solid machine after that i still find milk steaming a pain in the arse on it but until i get around to buying a new machine i can live with it done me very well over the last year of being stuck at home too,thomasreed hiya which tube i empty the machine after each use and run descaler through every month live in london so i have to tbh i should do it more often i also puly caf backflush the shower screen grouphead if anything is really bad i take it off and descale it in a bath obvs removing any gasket,how do you clean the tube if i may ask came back from holiday and they are all cloudy,no breville barista,can anyone recommend me an espresso machine under gbp300,can you review the lelit mara x in a future video it seems to be the best deal for a hx machine on the market right now,im that person who just want a good espresso or milk drink that ive made i need a good home set up a good grinder and a good espresso machine not pod that doesnt cost to much but doe a good job and doesnt need modding so thanks for this video it helped a little,how would the espresso quality of these compare to la pavoni europiccola,i will blame james for buying my wonderful gaggia learning tip and trick for it now,i loved the silvia but it cost 750 euro in morocco doe it really worth it,how about the sunbeam breville uk barista max seems very similar to the sage breville u barista express but at a lower price point and possibly a better built in grinder,hey james can you do a video for automatic espresso machine my work environment just doe not allow me have a manual and there is no coffee shop around me love your video,amazing content can you please recommend several espresso machine under 200dollar if any at all that actually make acceptable espresso would really appreciate your expertise,i am looking at getting an espresso machine but want to spend le than gbp200 primarily it will be used for latte cappuccino is the delonghi dedica worth the extra money other the under gbp100 machine or am i better off saving some gbpgbpgbpgbp,still waiting on that best grinder under 500 gpb video,i am using the delonghi now for more than a year i make four cup each double shot of expresso with it and sometimes more if i have guest no issue with it right till now,hello james got the de longhi 685 last year before i upgraded to a dual boiler machine you are right with your estimation in my eye but you can adjust brewing temp by using the menue combined with a bit temp surfing and your portafilter mod there is an ok espresso possible for normal purpose steaming is good enough latte art is not intended build quality is also ok for this money starting time is vety fast so you can also use it for making hot chocolate the milk steamer isnt very easy to clean due to the plastic part cheer and thx for your excellent professional and understandable vids greets from germany fx,hi do you know if would be possible to use a not pressurized filter into a oster prima late that is designed to use a presurized filter,i inherited a sylvia from my uncle which he bought at least 15 year ago it is an incredible machine and still brew great coffee even after being transported across the country multiple time i have always been frustrated w the temp control so this wa affirming you have inspired me to finally take the plunge and modify,hello what do you think about gaggia carezza deluxe with temperature indicator but i guess without solenoid valve,thank you,obviously it is a much more expensive machine but i would love to hear what you think of the silvia pro seems like they have prioritized the temperature issue,you can not repair di longhis easily or at all i am sick of throwing them in the bin all the others should be possible to fix,you should create your own espresso machine and grinder brand that is more affordable i am tired of drinking bad coffee but dollar500 is just too much i think dollar200 is more affordable to a wider audience,i have the smeg ecf01 version of the delonghi dedica and it is fine i just want home espresso and a small footprint is my main requirement a kitchen space is at a premium so i can not park ugly truck on the work surface i bought the smeg from my london john lewis store a they have a good post sale reputation if i want to explore coffee i support my local baristas rather than being a lesser version of them at home you pay your money,still the one of the only coffee youtubers who doe not tamp on the spout would not expect it from a world champion but it annoyed me so much when looking around on youtube for an affordable home espresso machine the anna look like a solid machine with the basket changed for a precision one,which wa the best,quite annoying that all these machine are at least gbp50 more expensive than talked about on the video and comment,great video there is a much better way to steam with the gaggia press steam button wait 8 second open steam valve to purge condensate close steam valve wait 10 second open the steam valve before the light turn on steam for day cheer,can anyone explain to me what james is mentioning about the different portafilters and why he like one over the other i am confused wanted to understand that better what doe he mean by using a proper basket thanks,james you should check out the lelit anna 2 with pid temperature control it an excellent machine and a great value,james i have the gaggia classic pro 2019 i live in the u handy but not an expert coffee first everything else second i want to modify my machine for better espresso what do you recommend and where to purchase from from scale basket pdi spring kit,why not feature the sage duo temp pro instead i got one recently second hand very good price and while i wa expecting an adequate home espresso machine i have been pleasantly surprised that it doe everything i need quite tidily,it seems like these espresso machine manufacturer go a long way out of their way to avoid known successful sensible feature that would not cost anything more to manufacture,wonder how the new lelit anna 2 would compare with the pid controller still within this price range please link this upgraded basket you used for the 58mm machine unfair for a review but interesting,do not see the point of changing the filter basket for the review when most people are not going to do that,i have a sage bambino love the machine however lately the coffee seems to be coming mostly from one spout not sure why,cafelat robot manual lever machine,good vid thx,you can buy a pid for the silvia from the money you will save from maintenance and replacement a it will last forever with generally good treatment of it i still use a v1 for the last 20 year it is a tank curious what the average lifespan of the other four machine are,i have had a silvia for 12 year i have been able to repair it a required i have been able to calibrate it a required i set it to 9 5 bar after rep lacing the opv valve and i love it dearly i am currently thinking about adding a pid to it currently i have a simple panel thermometer thermopasted to the boiler which allows me to know when the boiler is going to turn on off and when it get to ideal steaming temperature a dollar10 mod everyone should do so i get really consistent result i will however always wish i had a machine that can pull shot and steam milk simultaneously maybe one day i will part with this wonderful machine and if i do that will be the only reason,try doing one of these with manual espresso maker they are much cheaper,i am on my second silvia i gave the first one to a family member and i am fairly satisfied but i am interested in getting the next level up wondering what you might recommend,silvia pro,i have had the dedica for about 3 year and am very happy with it the coffee is much better than i get from the local cafe is it is got a small footprint so is great if space is limited yes you do have to hold the machine across the top when fitting the basket which mean you can not store anything on the top platform but i have never accidentally pressed any of the button it can also take larger cup when the drip tray is removed you have a flat base with a stainless steel insert it would mean the base would have to be wiped clean each time you use it if like me you only have one or two coffee in the morning that would not be an issue i never use the milk thingy apology james so i can not comment on that,too bad those machine get so expensive to import around here that delonghi might not be the best but is gorgeous to look at,i only drink instant coffee but here i am watching this,hello james i think it is worth to mention that with the delonghi dedica you can adjust the temperature and the amount of water dispensed out of the box this help to give you a little more control over the brew cheer,adrian nasui you are welcome hope you will have a better coffee experience,stefano ferrante found it with the delonghi dedica you can control via setting temperature low mid high auto shutdown time 9 min 30 min 3hrs water durity and shot time thanks to your comment i found that out so thank you sir,adrian nasui just read the manual i do not remember the process,how do you do that,james doe not go into this in the video but there are way to elongate shorten the shot on the bambino you hold down the shot button for 3 second then it is a free pour till you press the button again locking in the shot time there are way to program the shot that allow for better dialing in instead of just using the preset but for sure i agree with his other point on the machine,hi james how about the best espresso machine under gbp1000 would sage breville barista express make it to the list,can you make a review about gemelai 3200 c,supposedly for greater steaming power with the gaggia turn the steam on 10 second before the light come on steam will supposedly last longer and be a bit more powerful,fyi the delonghi doe allow you to increase the tempreature,my name is lalit i am a little bit impressed,all machine are ugly only delenghi is beautiful for home kitchen,4 40 best valve fan v still pathetically domestic fan backhand slapp would xd,if you are not italian you can not talk for espresso just sit down and enjoy i can not listen expert saying spend thousand or hundred for an amazing espresso when the solution is the traditional make,i have the silvia with a pid it requires a good grinder to get your fineness down and that setting will change depending on the roast you use however once mastered you can pull some excellent shot also it is very well built with a brass boiler and stainless steel part the part are easily replaceable on the internet but there may not be a need for part for year all it take for year of life is minimal maintenance a lot of the one returned for service are from the boiler are caked with mineral from tap water do not use tap water use filtered water for long life and descale a needed i wait until my temperature drop one degree then descale,i have had my rancillio silvia for well over 10 year and it is clearly my longest serving appliance she wa joined by little brother rocky when my old grinder gave up the ghost last year,james we need a 2kgbp home espresso setup video,i am starting to be quite enthusiastic watching some of your video learning lot of info in each of them currently in a very early and innocent phase of my caffe barista experience probably with a lack of info and research i purchased a delonghi like the one reviewed and im despertely trying to get good caffe using wrong tool it is quite a nightmare to get an espresso at all considering im using a single blade grinder without grinding tunning randomly suspecting that sth might be wrong with pump or pressure however i feel i should not completely blame the machine perhaps i should change the filter and acquire a tunnable grinder then i could have a better opinion anyway great review with quite some hint thanks,i have something similar to these machine it is a capresso ec100 it wa free from my work reward program it is my first espresso machine and i have been trying to figure out how to make it consistent and i feel the steam wand is too short for steaming for latte but the froth tip is ok for cappuccino i think i feel sometimes the espresso ha a ton of fluffy crema not sure if that is ideal for trying to make a latte with a design on top,could you please review the smeg espresso machine,great vid i have had my gaggia classic for close to 8 year now and i have never had an issue with it only recently have i begun foaming milk and the plastic wand is not great warranty is long gone so maybe i should attempt modding it,a bit late for personal opinion but here is mine about the de longhi dedica ec685 while i wa away on a trip our old machine broke so my parent went out and got a new one solely based on the discount the dedica i came home from italy and i wa blown away by the coffee it produced it wa by no mean perfect but for the money i found the fact that it wa even comparable to genuine italian espresso to be astonishing the machine is been working for a few year now only needed a valve change in that time with a decent flat burr grinder and a non pressurized basket these i have invested in recently it make pretty good espresso while not taking up too much space the reason i am going to upgrade to something more serious is the fixed high pressure which make it hard sometimes impossible to dial in shot generally i would say it is a good machine especially for people on a tight budget or for those with fairly limited space on the kitchen counter,very helpful video but do wish you had used a more affordable grinder one that doe not cost 3x machine,could you please tell me what is the difference between lelit pl41lem amp pl41em the first one a little bit expensive but i could not find the difference between them,the mess all over my kitchen bench can attest to the steam wand on the rancilio after owning it for a week it is absurd for a home machine,thanks thought out jjajaj,22 min of talking not a single close up footage of what the shot look like in a shot glass,i just got a rancilia but my old starbucks barista with a bottomless portafilter seems to make better espresso not sure if i am doing something wrong,would have liked to see the solis barista perfecta included in this list,fantastic source of good information i have a gaggia classic pro on order so very excited to start experimenting here is a video with some tip for modifying the way the gaggia is used to overcome most of the issue mentioned by james a for the pressure i will be getting a new spring set asap,what wa the basket purchase for the delonghi link,i have a rancilio and can not get the sort of milk you are getting in this video james i have no chance of doing any art and always get thick froth at the end of my pour saying that it a great machine i descale it with citric acid every 12 week and thats it i must have had the machine for 8 year now and it look great after a polish up with stainless steel cleaner,i don t understand why you didn t select the sage duo temp pro for the comparison in my eye it give you the best value and the best result for the money and the thermoblock concept is more sustainable than that of power hungry boiler machine therefore the sage is particularly interesting for single household,1st world problem lol,steaming with the gaggia a standard is not helped by the very wide range of temperature pressure when the steaming light is on the thermostat open at around 155c when the light come on but then will not close until the temperature ha dropped to around 115c so with the steam light on the temperature can be anything in that range i have added a dual digital thermometer with thermocouple attached to the boiler and the group head to my machine to help me see what is going on i have found i get the best result if i start steaming before the light come on at a boiler temperature of around 130c i then use the switch to maintain the temperature between 135c and 145c while steaming obviously a pid could to do this automatically but my modification cost around gbp20 and is completely reversible so you should be able to keep your warranty on a brand new machine,where do you find your basket,hi james my brother ha the delonghi dedica and i am just wondering where you picked up the double shot non pressurized basket,not me at 15 learning everything about coffee machine and planning to buy the third one,james ive a delonghi ec the problem is i feel every morning i get kind of a different coffee some day are good other day arent would that be the same with the gaggia and rancilio,i have the dedica appreciate the small footprint frustrated by the steaming wand unfortunately after a little over a year just out of warranty a seal appeared to have failed and i have yet to figure how or if i can fix it,have had a rancillo silva for at least 8 9 year great little beast of espresso machine but she is picky on grind setting,after watching this video got myself sage bambino plus for making cappuccino and i am very happy about it i wa contemplating buying an espresso machine for a while now and pandemic wa the final push to finally get one and i must say sage bambino is beginner friendly indeed a a beginner i struggle with frothing milk manually but with sage bambino i can get perfectly silky foam half automatically i begin on auto frothing jug placed on the machine and then lift the jug at the end of frothing to roll the milk work super well with whole milk also if you do not have a grinder yet the pressurized portafilter enables you making enjoyable espresso for milk drink even when using cheap pre ground coffee bambino come both with pressurized and non pressurized portafilters the overall coffee making process is also surprisingly fast but this is coming from a person who typically drink pour over now i am ready for the next step good manual grinder and quality bean,me an american coffee drinker those are really heavy espresso maker,after watching james video and kinda amaze with his passion for espresso went to bought some espresso gadget and machine to play with all i know for certain is i did not make good espresso at all but how to adjust and fine tune all the different aspect to get a good cup of espresso still beyond my grasp at this stage oh man i sense a long journey ahead but hey thanks for introducing me to espresso i always enjoy pour over but now i slowly learn to appreciate fine espresso made by others cuz i still have not master the art to make a good one myself,since i wa coming back to rewatch just some of the machine i thought i would put in the work for others build shot 2 13 7 42 lelit 3 22 8 47 delonghi 4 07 10 31 rancilio 5 03 11 43 sage 6 05 13 10 gaggia 15 42 steaming,youtube medal of honor winner we salute you,love you,your doing the lord is work,,god is work god is work,in summary they all pale in comparison to a simonelli commercial machine,i have had a delonghi dedica for around 6 year and obviously i am happy with it or i would not have had it for 6 year i recall it took some fiddling to get the brew i wanted and i ended up with a fairly fine grind using a rich dark bean the only real problem i had wa finding a frothing jug small enough to be able to submerge the end of the frothing wand into the milk i normally have a latte but from time to time i will make an espresso or americano or even a cappuccino i bought it when i wa not exactly flush with money and since i can afford something better i have been looking around which is how i ended up here but every time i look at a better espresso machine i realize that i am happy with what i have and that is the whole point is not it,same here i even bought a second dedica 685 when i saw one on offer a a back up a i can not really see much more benefit to buying higher priced machine i am pretty happy with the milk steamer but i am trying mod next i am just waiting for my bottomless portafilter and non pressurised basket to see if there is any difference,why waste money on that when you can add 100 more to get something much better,teodor angelov how come i know at hottest setting i can not drink the coffee right away at lowest the water is a james said almost warm,multibugggs if you want it even hotter you can put it on the steam setting and then immediately power off and on the machine i have found that it is even hotter,also it seems james missed the fact that you can remove lower the drip tray for a bigger cup,still rocking the rancilio silvia v1 with auber pid,wow le than 12 month later and silvia is gt dollar700,i really like your beautiful hair color,have a gaggia classic which must be 20 year old fit and finish is pretty awful but it work great and super easy to repair just did the pump last week gbp15 and 5 minute,i have the delonghi dedica since 2 year back i am a former barista but had a limited budget when buying it i modified it by switching the steamwand to the rancillo which wa a little bit tricky but the end result is great the delonghi ha the perk of being a cheap machine which make modifying it not a scary a for example modifying the rancillo och gaggia so far i have to say i am very satisfied with my delonghi,do you have a link for the basket for the gaggia i altered the pressure in my gaggia using a gauge and altering the relief valve it is simply taking pressure off the spring that allows it to lift earlier but i work with pressure vessel for a living i also changed the steam wand for one off ebay which ha much improved it,love to see a 500 1 000 video a third installment in the series,i am a fancy man love you james,having binge watched about 20 video it is only now dawning on me the man ha taken at least 5 shot and sure the delivery get a little faster but the hand is brain surgeon steady thoroughly impressed,i am so happy with the the gaggia classic pro,you know i do not even like coffee i have no idea why i am so addicted to these video but boy doe it make me want to get into coffee,that is just too much money i am still using a dollar79 one i bought 30 year ago and it work fantastic experimented with grind and amount and ended up perfecting this machine is great cup,i do not think they sell such thing now,i like your build james,i have a sage bambino and really enjoy it it would be nice to be able to change the brew temp but other than that i have been very happy auto steaming milk feature and being able to turn on and make coffee within 3 are excellent feature especially when you are busy in the morning,it is a good machine for anyone who spends money on a lot of take out milk based drink most likely better if you dial it in and use better coffee,a year ago i purchased a delonghi dedica espresso machine and delonghi dedica grinder the grinder short circuited and the power switch on the espresso machine died i got my money back because they were within the warrantee period and i did not want to get delonghi replacement machine purchased a smeg ecf001 espresso machine and smeg grinder hopefully they will last longer than the warrantee period i would love to see you do a review of the smeg ecf01 machine the smeg machine are more expensive than the delonghis but feel better built and the ergonomics of both machine are better,thanks very much james for this review i actually have a very similar one to the delonghi ec685 that us a very dump black plastic thing in the holder if i want to replace the pressurized portafilter basket with a vst one which vst basket should i go for what is a normal formula 50 basket is it the ridgeless 15g one,i do not even drink coffee or expresso but james make it so intriguing,8 58 lol it ha a different portafilter the right one for the machine that i did not want to use so i damaged it and then did not work properly what a genius d,still using a bialetti because i can not decide which one and i am looking for a good opportunity on ebay w,would you be able to take a look at the de longhi scultura and see what mod would be possible a a yet i am not able to afford either the gaggia classic pro or the rancilio though they are now on my wishlist on amazon,next do a best espresso machine over dollar1000,be aware that the dedica ha a tendency to explode with finer grind when this happens you can jsee the handle turn back by itself and then boom there is coffee all over the kitchen it wa the only coffee machine that would fit in our tiny kitchen so we are still using it we keep an elastic band around the handle to try and stop the accident,hi james full disclosure i have no interest in coffee at all however youtube plopped your video in my suggestion and i am totally hooked on your vids very informative good camera work and editing to the point where i will join my wife she drink coffee for a cup when lockdown is over i will be looking out for acidity and body from now on keep up the good work subbed,how many people are going to buy one and use it honestly how many thing do you have lying in your kitchen you never use cause it is too much hassle same a these over priced machine you want an espresso go to a proper coffee shop cost next to nothing and you help to employ people,u forgot to mention the best feature of the delonghi that drip tray look like a face,here i am using a 30 40 dollar machine,i am a coffee snob on a budget so this is perfect i have been using a cheap de longhi forever now started roasting coffee and making homemade expresso to save money i do not expect to have the best i just need something that save me money compared to going to cafe,dripoffee machine for 20 buck not higher,i got a 10euros french press it is build from glass which is nice it can make 0 7 litre of coffee at once if i drink two full french press before noon i am fine for the rest without any headache four star out of five,where is the la pavoni it would beat all of these hand down,i got the sage recently and i got it specifically a a learner machine i am focusing on the shot itself at the moment not having to worry about thing like temperature surfing once i am more confident with the shot i am hoping to switch over to frothing technique and while i have no doubt that i might want to upgrade to a nicer setup in the future it really help making this hobby feel more approachable,i have had a gaggia classic for seven year and can not fault it great machine,that is pre 2015 then which were allegedly better built,he fall in the caffeine addict category if you take his caffeine away he would become a mass shooter,12 07 this got me in to it i knew it wa getting serious,not gon na lie i got a gaggia classic thinking it wa very good but a soon a i got a bit more into brewing i did a pid and pressure mod now the result are well appreciated by people who appreciate good espresso most of my friend however can not tell any difference and still believe the best coffee to get is at starbucks shame,can i win that gaggia haha,not even in the market for a machine but i find his video strangely compelling,i do enjoy my dedica tho i use most thing stock with lavazza medium or cafe bustelo dark and i pull some goodnshots though at time it doe feel underextracted here and there i really do not like the portafilter tho,super video thank you very much the audio on the 100 pound video sound like a 500 pound audio and vice versa d but this doe not take away from the awesomeness of your video lt 3,got the delonghi for under 100euros i am really happy with it for that price,you should really do this video with blind testing i feel like verything else is biased also wear headphone so you do not recognize the machine sound if you still come to the same conclusion i am impressed otherwise hmmmm,i do not even drink coffee but this wa interesting lol,this whole coffee craze is ludicrous,i am really undecided between the sage barista express and the gaggia classic pro i know the sage doe have the grinder but in term of the espresso and the frother capability which one is a better choice i have watched endless hour of review and can not make my mind on this one thanks a million,loved the video i will say i am surprised about the deloghi i heard good thing about it and that is why i brought one and it is a shame that you did not think it wa great i do agree that it doe produce too much foam also could you do a video on your best all time coffee maker you have reviewed at any price point and best grinder under gbp100 gbp500 thanks,i do not even drink coffee let alone espresso how the f do i sit here at 10pm at night watching a snob reviewing some cheap espresso maschines,i got into coffee video to take my mind off of politics,zoe morgan in comparison to what the average houdhould will not spend 1000 euro dollar pound on a coffee machine i am well aware that you can make better espresso with the perfect bean and the perfect equipment and skill but there is a difference between cheap and good value one can play guitar without spending 10 000 on a strat or a paula one can cycle a mountain without spending 10 000 on a carbon fiber frame and one can make good not the best espresso without spending 3 000 on a fancy italian espresso machine that is his point and that is why i like his channel,doemi s it is cheap in comparison and this is espresso not just coffee because it requires highly specific temperature and pressure which can be a challenge to get right for cheap machine,the moment when 500gbp are considered cheap for coffee you know that people have way to much money,we are watching a bloke pulling his shot there must be other site with more relevant late night content,i have a delonghi and i love that it doe not take much space on the counter is stylish and great quality the cappuccino we get from it are better than starbucks for much le money,clearly i know nothing about espresso except i like it,21 14 that rather ha to do with the target group instead of the snob appeal perceived build quality,got my rancilio in 2008 and ha used it daily without problem so the build quality is indeed very good everything from case to boiler and wiring is heavy duty the older model ha slightly different button and portafilter handle but is otherwise identical to the current design a far a i can tell,hey james i am a dad my daughter wake me up early every morning and i am in need of a niche zero wan na send me yours joking aside i just got a gaggia pro that is replacing a second hand lelit anna sans pid that required several fix repair boiler replace gasket etc and i am very impressed at the espresso the pro produce it is a great budget buy,i have a gaggia classic can you please tell me what i need to look for to change the porter filler i like all your vids keep em coming,my take away from this video it going to be a challenge to get a consistent good espresso from machine that cost under 500 pound the good news is i am a cappuccino guy so i am sure these machine will do the job,i do not even drink coffee but i am hypnotised by this guy,i hated the taste of coffee until my current age 28 but now that i got a grinder and an aeropress thanks to james and i know how to get the sweetness and fruity complexity taste of origin out of the bean i have to say it is a pretty exciting world,that wa super detailed nice stuff i actually just ordered a gaggia classic pro which is probably why this came up it will definitely be a big upgrade from my delonghi stilosa i have been using i doubt i will be doing any crazy modding but will probably upgrade some thing over time,did you get the gaggia how is it been so far,thank you i wa a bit disappointed initially that you modded the delonghi a i currently use it with the default basket but it sent me down a rabbit hole of learning why pressurized v non pressurized basket exist and what they do about to order a non pressurized basket since i have a pretty good grinder rancilio hsd roc sd tempted to go bottomless a i learned that is a thing for pulling great shot too thanks again,have you reviewed the nespresso line of machine yet,i own the delonghi and i never encountered any problem yes you can hold it when inserting why can you do not have to slam it in like a berserker and saying you press any button while holding it is simply not true i do not know how weird you would have to hold it never happened to me than you said you want more space for your cup and you can do that so easily i do not know why you would not mention it the stand can be removed so you have the desired space milk it foam it or not depending on your setting it just work i do not know if this is a reoccurring theme on your channel but i have watched now quite a few of your video and you seem extremely prejudiced towards some machine you can not just say it is good for the money you always have to add something to it for anyone else if your whole life revolves around the perfect molecular density of your beloved espresso and you will not stop talking about it then please buy the best equipment there is but if you just want a good cup of espresso get a few good bean and invest in the delonghi enjoy the product not the god awful northern european science too making it,great video i have had my rancilio silvia for twenty year now it needed a fix under warranty the thermostat i think however it ha had no issue since personally i think that is really impressive the chrome is coming off the thing the filter lock into though i believe it is called the group head maybe all of these other unit would last a well but my guess is that would be optimistic so one vote for the silvia the odd thing with the silvia is that all the switch are upside down even after all this time this still catch me out occasionally one point that mine doe not do is the thing james showed where steam come out of the group head for some reason i do not get that,why am i waching this video i do not even drink coffee,the dedica tray come out to allow for more distance bigger mug,my delonghi 2800 corsa bean to cup cost gbp150 in argo sale,hello can you help me what do you think about the gastroback espresso machin if possible answer my question thanks a lot,where is the aldi special,there should definitely be a merch t shirt that say i am a fancy man,i have 2 rancillio silvia one wa a present from my wife and the second one i bought it second hand 1 model older but in pristine shape for dollar250 this machine not only make great espresso and cappuccino but they are also super reliable i have been making espresso for 6 year every single day and i had no issue other than changing the gasket i will like your recommendation on portafilter though which one should i buy at the end totally worth the expense if you drink coffee every day great video by the way,sage height wont be for scale will be for people wanting to make tall coffeees,there are pid for the rancilio that have been around for year quite fun to do,i wish that i could trust caf s to be aware of all of the many delicate factor responsible for making good espresso i just moved to a slightly different neighborhood here in manhattan and i purchased two totally undrinkable latte today both were thrown away after only 3 sip or le and i wa not even feeling that picky today lol so basically i am very skeptical that any barista i have for across so far will be able to make an espresso for me better than what i could possibly learn to do if i purchased my own machine this is my first video exploring machine and this guy is making me feel good about my decision i knew there wa way more to espresso than i currently knew or that the average baristas where proficient in i do not hear them talking about any of these thing when making my latte lol,scale sir honestly officer i am a barista,thank you for all the detail in this video however i would like to ask if you have any opinion on the solis barista perfetta plus would you maybe make a review of that machine,shorturl ca

looking at getting into espresso and had my eye on that,do not get dedica or bambino or stilosa they are more toy than anyyhing else,i would love to get your opinion on purchasing a used entry level commercial unit perhaps a review comparing san marino rancilo astoria wega etc,you can see the caffeine taking effect a the video go on i swear he talking faster at the end,having the silvia myself i definitely agree with the point made that said you do not need to spend over gbp100 to add a pid to the silvia or gaggia classic a stated in the video i installed a xmt 7100 pid in mine for a total cost of gbp26,i have the lelit pl042 with integrated grinder absolutely fantastic machine if you give it a little time in regard the video i would have reviewed them all with the standard filter that would have made it fairer i also think the lelit look better and in 5 year of ownership i have never overfilled the drip tray,sure you are not a skilled gaggia user if you steam the milk a little before the ready light turn on the gaggia will do a much better job than your demo,i bought my silvia 6 or 7 year ago and it wa if i remember correctly gbp379 i got it online from italy a it wa cheaper than getting one from the uk embarrassingly after all the effort i went to in searching for the best price i never use it a i am a bit lazy and love my little moka pot however since watching this video i think i might start using it again maybe p s it really is built like a tank my cat sits on it and it doe not budge an inch,haha,absolutely love your channel i am fascinated by coffe and you help me learning about it i got the wmf lumero and i would love you doing video on it there is not a lot of information about it a it is not a popular a the delonghi dedica i feel i could make the most of it,have you reviewed any machine from breville or ikohs i am interested in knowing sonething about breville barista mini thanks,can you review the ascaso dream,them spoon would be great for mixing your hazelnut syrup into your coffee ill get my coat,good clear review i have a different sage machine love it and your characterisation of why it work for some people is spot on i think plus i am going to ditch the pressure basket given opening comment,thank you for that just discovered this channel and love the content any chance to have a review on the nespresso delonghi machine my daughter would like one for her first flat,this video wa cover to show off the spoon collection,i will save everyone time just buy the gaggia get on wit life and drinking gud espresso,we love our valasca prestige delicious every time,what is with the stirring,also lelit allows you to adjust the pressure so you have the right pressure at 9 bar,have been using the bambino plus since january 2020 absolutely love it i can really play with my shot and milk when i want to using my sage smart grinder or i can almost set and forget the auto milk texture is more than adequate when i am in a rush and want something milky and it pull great shot with some adjusted pre infusion got it on sale gbp199 if you can get it at a similar price or lower highly recommended,you should review the quick mill 820,james i love your critique of the varied machine but on a personal note i really love your hair i think you are a good looking man,we need one for grinder too because the niche zero is sold out instantly when they get stock it like the ps5 of the coffee world is there grinder out there that are just a good,18 00 summary of all machine experience,i do not even drink espresso,also i prefere breville mini barista,this rancilio silvia mod beat all this guy give his silvia a brain see it here,some thought regarding francisfrancis by illy x1,a your fancy man comment wa so quick amp awkward so pleased to see you now own it in later vids even saying it with a delightful giggle bringbackdafancy,hi james have you tried gaggia carezza deluxe it is comparable to delonghi dedica ec685 thanks,james love your content we recently bought the breville bambino sage in the u k i guess i noticed that you swapped out a component from the portafilter when testing the bambino we have got the baratza encore grinder do you think that is a good enough grinder to merit the same switch of component you do did or should we stick with the default and if you think we should swap it out could you let me know what it is that we would buy to swap in a you can tell we are utter novice but love our coffee many thanks nick,what about the gaggia carezza deluxe i have one,i have a silvia i have had it for about six year i think maybe longer and i would not buy anything else at this price point super steam power good shot the build quality and look is amazing too,i have found your many video very helpful so after watching your comparison of the best espresso machine under euros500 i decided to splurge and buy the breville sage bambino plus my goal wa to be able to make a good cappuccino without having to steam the milk myself well i have had the bambino for four day now and while it make a good espresso i have no hope of ever drinking a good cappuccino i have tried all the combination of temperature and froth level but the problem is always the same milk on the bottom and foam on the top and never the two shall meet i do not know if this is part of the problem but after i purge the wand and then insert it into the milk jug but before i have time to place the jug on the sensor steam start coming out and creates a cloud of big airy bubble then it stop i have taken to scooping out those bubble before proceeding to press the steam button to start the texturing so what to do sage doe not seem to have a help center you can call or email and none of the online problem forum ha addressed my particular problem i would be grateful for any advice on what to do otherwise i will have no choice but to start the long process of learning to steam milk myself,i have had the delongi one for a few year now and it is amazing how he pointed out everything that i have learned in a few year in just a few hour the only thing i would add is that the paint on the metal really wa not high quality in fact it wa rubbing off after just a few month of use to reveal a darker grosser metal look,from my experience when getting cheaper appliance like the dedica definitely is always try to get a model that is not painted i specifically got the silver dedica just because cheaper product tend to loose their paint extremely fast across all product category but maybe thats just me being unlucky,you can adjust the brew temperature on the delonghi,hey james i heard you mention using citric acid for descaling that sounded cool and le expensive than the ripoffs available in store would be interesting to see more on that topic from you,i think he mentioned 5percent citric acid so 5g dissolved in 100cc of water or rather 50g per litre i assume then you would use it a per your manufacturer is instruction,i do not see a reason to purchase any of these a high quality machine let is say a breville express arguably one that continues to receive high mark is only dollar200 more on the other side of the coin amortizing dollar700 for a daily espresso or two or three is going to take some time and that is not including the cost of the coffee or the grinder or the storage container now we are over a grand if espresso is part of one is daily routine and not a fad spend the money otherwise go to starbucks,could you do a comparison for sub 1000 coffee machine,where do you buy your basket upgrade,i am looking to upgrade a la pavoni,hello james very good review love them how about a comparison between one to this espresso machine and a superatuomatica what do you think about superautomatica machine,i love this video i am thinking of upgrading my breville soon i wanted to get a dual boiler home machine and i think a video of the top entry dual boiler machine would help many people with their decision,james may i ask you which filter you have used for the sylvia i have some better filter but due to the flat heat of the sylvia they are quite big and i have to use a lot of coffee in order to fill them,such a power move making eye contact while taking a shot of coffee,i noticed that too and wondered about it,i have had a silvia for 7 year now with a pid on it i think you are correct without the pid it would be tough to get a consistent shot but with a pid it is a rock star great quality and built to give year of service,i wa really hoping james wa going to say the silvia is an absolute unit,uncompletedrecall i am not sure which version i have either first or second i have it for 7 year and my sister husband had it for year before it is still an absolute unit,a a ver 1 owner for over 20 year i can safely say it is the only gripe from the vid is temp control with the money you will save by not having to maintain nearly a much or replace you can buy a pid to solve that problem,i would love to know how these comapre to manual espresso machine can you get a better espresso for the price with something like the flair if you do not mind it being a bit more involved,the best espresso machine under 500 would be a second hand commercial machine all these baby are total rubbish,hi james master have you tried also severin ka 5995 in comparison with delonghi what you think is better thanks,i am still rocking a silvia v2 had nothing but great performance from it simple built like a tank and easy to use,could someone please explain why he stirred the shot at 8 20 i wa taught that disturbing the crema wa the ultimate taboo when it came to making a good espresso shot wa that information wrong,i hear the exact opposite it should be stirred,james i have a tiny kitchen and brought the delonghi 2 3 year ago there are some temperature increase setting which i found important i now have brought a bottomless portafilter and swapped the steam wand for a small rancillio wand very valid comment about the coffee a a hobby lockdown ha taken this hobby to new level i now have the rokgc grinder and dialling that in i would love a prosumer machine review a i guess that is my next step in the journey,i have really never cared for coffee of course i have not tried every kind of coffee and machine either so i googled espresso machine and grinder and bought the best set up it wa a staggering dollar20 000 i am sorry i do not get it i guess i am just not a coffee drinker,can you review the beko bean to cup model ceg5311x please,i guess now it is time for high end coffee machine comparison,is there a video where you talk about the best expresso machine you use any price,i have got an idea for a short episode how about comparing the cheapest one on this episode to the most expensive one on the le than dollar100 episode on the other note i appreciate this i have been in search for a while now for my home setup the weight wa a huge factor for me and i will look into the silvia a little more,i do not have the kind of money spare to buy a gbp500 coffee machine but here i am listening intently to all of their pro and con how doe james make me care so much,the cool thing is that you can find sylvias in good condition used for half that price at least in the state also here anyway you can find sylvias with a pid for not much more than book price i learned my lesson the hard way and bought a baby twin which i would consider closer to the sage in build quality and when it died 3 year after purchase found out that it wa made to be discarded what james doe not tell you is that you will inevitably want to upgrade your machine and when you do having a sylvia is the only way you will get a return on investment,i am in the process of looking for a new espresso machine and i am pretty sure it is gon na land on the gaggia classic the price to value ratio speaks volume here and i do not have the additional 100 pound to go for the silvia on top of that for the price of silvia in poland you can get the gaggia a very decent grinder like the baratza virtuoso thanks for the video james they really helped me understand what i am looking for and a big thumb up for the understanding espresso series,hi can you please review lelit anita range they are 3 model,sir which coffee machine would you suggest for home which produce good espresso plus do you advice to get a fully automatic machine such a nespresso lattissima or something on tho ground thanks,hey james quick question the basket you talk about with the rancilio silvia that you replace is that the vst filter basket you replace it with and is it the 18 gram version thank you for the great content frederik,det vil jeg mene og det er pengene v rd k b det,why isnt there breville express,he is talking about machine without grinder,based on these review i feel like none of these machine are for me i would like something low profile and basic like the delonghi but at dollar300 i would rather invest that into a quality dollar500 machine that is not plastic and produce good espresso any suggestion on something simple and quality made,colin wendtwell unless you happen to live in the state and would be willing to ship a part to france for me cuz flair accessory are not available here and a naked pf would be quite nifty i would say i am fine just happy to help and if you wan na chat along further my ig is leodelizy,l o delizy both of those grinder brand look beautifully made and just what i need how can i thank you for all of this great information you have been such a help to me is there any coffee equipment you are looking to add to your life are you interested in connecting further i really appreciate your help and would like to offer a proper thank you,colin wendt i have a 1zpresso jx pro work really well i think your money should definitely go for a good grinder like that one a comandante or a lido it is really worth it and spend the rest on a neo add a pressure gauge and a standard pf and you are golden,l o delizy what grinder do you use i do not have a great one yet so the pressure filter might the way to go then upgrade the basket later my favorite brewing method currently is pour over and i grind my coffee with a blade yes i know and get decent result but i know good espresso requires a consistent grind i do own a hario skerton hand grinder but i find the result actually more inconsistent than my blade grinder so i have pretty much discontinued it use outside of french press thank you for your help,colin wendt i myself got a flair a i am a broke college student and while i absolutely love it get really good coffee out of it and enjoy the process of brewing with it every morning i have the basic spouted version without pressure gauge or naked pf and all that stuff which add up to the cost the preheating is a bit annoying too nothing to write home about but a james rightfully said in his video the flair is just a tad fiddly if you got the money i would say go for the cafelat or the 9barista both excellent machine or so i have heard which look gorgeous will last a lifetime and produce awesome coffee and maybe more importantly enjoy the process manual machine are incredibly fun and granular and they are really not that much of a hassle if you have any more question i would be happy to help,james nice review is there any chance for another comparison for around gbp1000 1500 like sage double boiler nuova simonelli musica rocket appartamento etc looking forward to it,hi james what kind of water filter would you recommend for home coffee brewing,do you have a video about modifying the gaggia i have just bought one and i am experiencing the same frustration with the pressure and temperature,james i enjoyed your video however it raise the issue that there are different need i will comment on the delonghi dedica in particular thing you missed or understate but i mean no complaint size very good foot print for small counter basket insert no problem with two hand which i find i use even on full size machine water tank easy to remove refill and replace just slide straight down overrun tray it is three part remove the cover then remove the first tray and you have tray that can hold a regular size coffee cup so that my double shot for a cappuccino can go straight into the cup rather than first into a brew cup to be poured into a larger final cup or simply run double shot twice for a regular cup of coffee startup 45 second and you are ready to brew milk you need some practice with all machine with a little practice the delonghi dedicate gave me perfectly creamy milk and very importantly i did not have to use an amount of milk more than just for my regular coffee cup size cappuccino temperature the brew temperature can easily be set separately each for single and double shot raise the temperature to reduces the chance of sourness and bring out acidity dry touch top of tongue basket grind the factory basket i use only the double shot work fine with brand name coffee at a regular espresso grind i am happy with the machine it give me an espresso mine with a shot of cream and some sugar that is 85percent 95percent of most barista bar the pricey model are also not 100percent and seem to need modification like basket and thing to fix temperature and pressure although not 100percent for the price the delonghi dedica is in my opinion very good,i would probably guess that he will not like a 20k machine neither,not gon na lie i need fancy spoon too now,the truth is there is no spoon,how do these compare to the flair for you milk steaming aside if i am skint and want to make espresso ill i get a better result for le money from the flair without the pressurised basket of course currently i use a moka pot and an aeropress and espresso is a special going out kind of thing love your video thank you,would love a comparison of lelit glenda or anna with the stock pid v the silvia or gaggia with the aftermarket pid,is it better to use 14 or 18g on the lelit anna struggling with the brew recipe thanks for help which setting did you use,james hoffmann great stuff question though could you please share what is the calibrated basket you used for the lelit anna,to the people who own an espresso machine what espresso machine do you recommend that ha a good milk frother thank you,since you removed the pressurized portafilter basket in the bambino plus what basket you used to replace again sorry,i would really love some more video on milk steaming,i keep reading excellent review of all line of lelit machine i many of u would be indeed happy if you reviewed them above all considering their price seem to be competitive cheer,hello can someone help me with picking machine we had a de longhi scultura for gbp200 before but have returned co of few issue im looking for something a bit more expensive would say up to

perfectly done job thank you very much for this video i have some experience making espresso i have an ecm mechanika v slim at home and some of the point you showed here were very interesting

set the temp at 104c and the espresso shot are now very consistant now i am a avery happy man learning a lot from your channel thank you,i wonder why people think they are better placed than the equipment manufacturer to modify and improve these coffee machine seems to be a similarity here with hi fi enthusiast who feel they can do all sort of bizarre amateur modification to improve the sound quality delivered by well designed commercial product,they can and they do improve them in both coffee and hi fi audio manufacturer provide the best product within their budget customer want more have the time and money and they are entitled to enhance their machine to their taste i wonder why you have a problem with this,about a year ago john lewis had the sage bambino plus on offer briefly for gbp199 99 bought one and never regretted it it a great machine for people who want a fabulous coffee but do not want to become a coffee bore,i have the gaggia classic pro and i find i am having to get my coffee ground extremely finely i have just had ask for an even finer setting in the shop i go to which they usually only use for turkish coffee they ground it to the finest their machine is

anche i sostenitori del totalitarismo nella scienza indipendentemente dal loro livello dovrebbero essere mescolati a dati non univoci al punto da essere completamente irriconoscibili il che aumenta il loro stato di inutilit,i just bought the delonghi dedica about a month ago i removed the steaming cap and it really better and used a new basket on the same portafilter the espresso is not what i am looking for but milk drink cortado and flat white are pretty good i like it again for the money it is the best,can you do a review of the philip lattego 3200,where would you put smeg espresso machine,the lelit anna seems to be the la pavoni napolitana without the grinder it got the same material shape drip tray button knob tank brew head and annoying 57mm portafilter i am curious if the

year and i never knew there wa a difference in filtercups i have now gotten a non pressurized filtercup what a difference so glad i stumbled on to this video,kelvin chow hi kevin i would say go for the rancillo the bambino milk frother is rather bad after about half a year it started stop frothing on about every 3rd try just not a good quality of life although i bought mine at 50percent off which then i would say go for it,i am hoping to get one how much do you like the bambino,i have used two out of those five delongi and bambino i had the first for few year until it stoped working so i ordered bambino and i am not sure why it is not a hot in temperature a i wish even though it is set to the highest i do not like the texture it is to thin,dedica and bambino are a total joke,drinking one espresso after the other ist not the best way to test the taste because your body acidity make also the difference the more you drink the lesser they taste,what alternative filter would you recommend for a 57mm lelit,these day you have to be the perfect cook perfect barista perfect taste perfect everything lest you be judged on everything from coffee to toilet paper are there tp critique

specialist,i love your channel,the delonghi just seems like it is in the wrong weight class here,james you called it out but i kinda assumed you would overstated the case a little and you had not the steam pressure on the gaggia classic pro is really disappointing i can get by but i hoped for better i had better pressure with modded steamwand dedica actually even with the trick of steaming before the ready light illuminates i can barely sustain a whirlpool not sure if this would be fixed with a single hole steamer tip because two hole seems to work against itself in term of whirling but yeah wish i would gone with the silvia,there appears to be a pattern emerging so i am looking forward to the best espresso machine under gbp5000,i do not understand the point of changing out the basket it is not helpful if i want to get a machine for home if i have to modify what i buy,i just watched the 100gbp video love that you put the price tag right in the beginning great vid,man you give great review love your channel,how doe the breville barista max compare to these machine,i got lelit anna pl41em but have a problem to get creamy americano with le acidity like a before with very cheap

machine gbp250 with shipping to the uk,in coffee i only trust people who keep their spoon in a case,let pull a shot what a cock,great video but it should not be painful no need for wincing and pained expression,bambino is more than double the cost of dedica you do not say the shot are twice a good so the dedica is the best value,so i bought the dedica and it okay but honestly the flavour is better with my aeropress,am i an idiot i can not find the grind setting used especially for the lelit and i am sure someone below mentioned seeing them help pls good people,ignore i am an idiot,i have an older silvia and i had an older gaggia cc the big plus for the silvia is steaming power which required a bit of a learning curve but the usability is very questionable with this wide and flat drip tray it just a matter of time until i empty it onto the floor on the way to the sink the drip tray of the gaggia is way better it is not easy to check the water level on the rancilio on the cc you can see it from the front on the rancilio you need to lift the lid the painted metal frame of the rancilio will chip and rust a the machine get older over all i wa happier with the gaggia and will get myself an older ecm casa soon,great info mate thanks again,love to see under 1 000 and 1500 version of this video,so under 100 no under 500 maybe i want to buy a grinder and a machine to make a good

machine confuses me do you not like espresso or coffee drink enough to own a machine you often say owning a espresso machine is a job or a project and it requires too much work to get a decent espresso maybe i am not quoting you 100percent maybe an idea for a video would be no fuss espresso what do you recommend that is not a project that could give you the best consistent result,bambino sound about right to me,james very interesting to find your youtube account could you please recommend a small compact espresso coffee machine for my small coffee trailer i do like and tempted to order this rancilio silvia what do you say please bench depth 45cm i am based in hampshire just north of winchester if that make a difference to supplier etc you recommend thank you in advance for

think they make them,where is philip 5330,very good detail a usual from your video i am cursed with a dedica and am amazed you got 18grams into the basket i use a naked portia filter and non pressurised basket and struggle to get 14grams in it is an even greater struggle to get a decent drink,the plastic insert in portafilter is probably to prevent reaction of coffee acid with aluminum from portafilter and getting these bad product into shot,i just got the gaggia classic pro for christmas and i absolutely love it,grinder is much more important than coffee machine i guess,can you please do a comparison between the lelit glenda rancilio silvia and bezzera new hobby they seem very similar in price point and feature aside from the glenda is pid i want to learn how steam power build quality part availability stack up,i got a brand new sylvia for dollar200 can not be happier with it for this price,jorge ehrenwald found it on offerup lady owned 2 of those gift or something

this machine none of them doe a good espresso how much do i have to spend to have a nice espresso in home the home method are better,i got the lelit vip grace model also in that price range but much better than anna should try that one or at least check the spec,i have got a barista vcf126 barista max which come with dual walled portafilter basket doe anyone have any recommendation for single walled portafilter basket,greeting from finland i wanted to thank you for this review because it led me to try out the bambino since it wa the best combination of size price and feature for our current need also for anyone that might benefit from this bit of news this particular bambino did come with single wall basket in addition to the dual wall 1 amp 2 cup a of jan 2021 i had read rumour that more recent model were shipping with both and it appears to be the case which is lovely since i do not have to track one down separately perhaps relevant is that this is the sage version of their brand so i am not sure if the breville model ship the same way,perkele,coffee noob here never tried an espresso in my life but youtube recommended this to be so here i am can anyone tell me why when he make the espresso it make two cup side by side but then he only drink one doe he pour them into one cup why not just have both drip going into one cup,hi jameshoffman where did you get your new basket for the dedica i am interested in buying one for a friend thanks for the awesome content,i am surprised that delonghi is included in this range for comparison it is not competent to be compared with the rest of them,i own a delonghi since three year or four maybe i don t care and also a grinder graef and had no problem at all from start to now to be honest i am no barista and all i can say is that i like my coffee or cappucino or espresso more then most of everything i can get elsewhere i spend little money for coffeebeans and get mostly cheap one because i do not taste the big difference between cheap and expensive at last not big enough to pay double the price or more a i mentioned i am no enthusiast i just like a good hot coffee i like it easy on the spot and fast to me the delonghi work good and if there will be any trouble i can get a new one for the price of a repair of a more costly one thanks for your interesting video i like your effort and had fun to watch a fancy man,delonghi dedica ha temperature control low med high did you know that it also ha a thermal block for fast heat it ha programable shot volume and off timer a well a cleaning descale mode you really blew past this one you can get these for under dollar200 may be you should do under dollar200 category the other machine are dollar500 and big really apple and orange if you can not get decent shot from the delonghi you are not trying really a good machine and a value winner in this line up really a good a a siliva no but 2 5 time le expense p the i hit button holding it is a petty complaint you are just clumsy the machine you do not have to hold to install remove portafilter are large and heavy it is by design being small and light not by accident or cheapness,so are you saying that even if i spend 300 500dollar on an espresso machine it not worth it and there no point in me trying to enjoy and or get into espresso,let get into espresso james hold on unless you drop dollar500 on a grinder dollar50 ounce coffee dollar2k on an espresso machine then it not worth it,hahahahah great point,very interesting video i wa thinking of getting delonghi dedica limited budget but after seeing your review make me have second thought,hi james where can i buy a 54 mm filterbasket that fit a sage barista express should be same filter size a the bambino i have searched for a better basket without any luck with ims etc do anyone have a link,if i had to pick one of these the racncilio sylvia would be the one without even a second of hesitation i am old enough to remember usenet conversation on alt coffee where people were just starting to add pid controller to it and getting really good result that should give some indication how long that model ha been around it is still basically the same machine everything i have read indicates that with that with a pid added a lot easier now with actual kit available it bat way above it is price point,the vst basket make big difference,please review some automatic machine ex delonghi bosch philip for people who are not looking for a hobby,after many year of struggling to manage temp on a gaggia classic i recently upgraded to an e61 hx machine the difference is amazing no more bad shot they range from good to great depending on how i do my part,i feel like there is a disconnect here for people who are on on a budget i feel like i am shopping for a car and i just want something that run reliably and i am being told i need at least 400hp and a full leather interior with heated and air conditioned seat and a premium hi tech infotainment system and stereo and adaptive cruise control the under 100 video seemed like a bit of an insult a if you are saying if you can not spend hundred or even thousand of dollar on such a small aspect of your life a coffee you should not even try,little teapot that is a very well thought out response i see your point i guess my problem is that coffee is what i would call one of my minor hobby for example i will spend good money to have a car that is fun to drive and i will drop hundred on a new camera lense because those are thing i am passionate about and lens have great resale value there is a dollar350 lense that i have wanted but i have not bought because i keep asking myself if i really need it coffee on the other hand is something i enjoy sparingly when i have the time so i would be happy to compromise on the coffee machine that would not be perfect in order to have money left over to support other hobby i am more invested in coming across this video that promised to tell me what machine would give me the best performance in this price range he just seemed to dismiss them all in favor of spending more money that is not what i clicked on this video for,a a car and coffee lover i get what you are thinking with the analogy but let me assure you he is not trying to tell you that you need 400hp it is more that we know how good coffee can be and all these option have varying degree of compromise that can prevent you in one way or another from achieving a really good cup in keeping with a car analogy let say the top end desirable cup is a dailey focused car that is not a luxury car but is a more expensive car because it ha a better build quality and le fault than it more affordable competitor they will all get you to a to b but one of those choice ha le fault better maintenance experience and maybe even is a car more friendlier than the rest for doing home repair it is not that we are insulting low budget i am on a lower budget trying to educate myself and trying to discern right now how much do i want need to invest a we speak i have been holding off for year now on getting my first espresso machine for much of the reason and flaw revealed in this video it is that we know each of the option ha something that might really be holding it back from making peak good coffee or something at least very close and if you know how good it could be it is really an insult and painful to all of u a coffee lover to have to recommend a machine that still cost something but will prevent the buyer from making peak quality coffee the take away i am trying to say is he is not telling you to buy a bmw m2 c instead of a civic because it is an objectively better car even though what you need is a reliably affordably daily and you do not need a track car instead think of it that he is trying to warn you away from buying car in the category of the pontiac g5 they are cheap and like any car get you to a to b but they are infamous for multitude of issue making it one of the worst budget daileys you could pick we are trying to say maybe spend more money on a new accord or civic because yes it is more money whose function is to only daily but the point is that you are trying to pick something le terrible it all come down to how happy you are with the end result coffee from each budget range if you are happy with the coffee you can get from lower budget machine than that is fantastic and no one should be insulting that like i am stuck right now because i would rather not spend a much a a 3090 gpu on a machine and grinder individually but i also really do not want to get a cheaper machine that is finicky and difficult and will hold me back from making a perfect cup once i get the experience i actually do not know how much i need to spend to get that but i took away some really solid info from this video about the downfall of each machine,the video is informative do not waste your money on a sub 100 machine is not an insult it is good advice maybe try an aeropress or a moka pot instead i can not afford a gbp500 machine just yet but i absolutely love my aeropress and moka pot,what portafilter should i use on the delonghi,you can raise the temperature in the delonghi thru the setting,even so it temperature is underwhelming,wow tiny cup of coffee is so expensive now do a best dollar10 000 coffee maker,can you please do a review on the spinn machine,i have recently bought a delonghi dedica and noticed the machine i have is an updated version which ha addressed several of the issue you mentioned a a beginner machine i am very happy with the amount of programmability it ha allowing me to tune the machine to the coffee i like,malcolm sutton this is a review of the new one for a start i can get big cup in i am not sure he wa paying proper attention to the dedica if i am honest,evansisgreat what improvement have delonghi made i realise it is difficult if you do not have the old version,i have owned a rancilio silvia for 10 year and estimate i have made about 7 000 espresso shot in this time with the exception of having to replace the gasket in the brew head it is operated flawlessly without servicing for this entire time i feel this wa a great investment and would recommend this machine to anyone tired of the endless cycle of disposable household technology,pretentious and overpriced bialetti hob moka doe the job and will last you decade,hi james what would you recommend for under gbp200,what coffee machine would you buy on a budget gbp450 gbp600,great video is there 1 machine out there in the pro sumer category that is the clear and away winner,i am just a make a decent coffee without having to mess about kind of guy and have got through two delonghi dedica model in 4 year they worked fine and gave me what i wanted one double shot a day but they both failed through leaking internal part after just over 2 year you can take it apart and buy replacement part which i have done only for a fault to occur elsewhere in a short time do not bother,if anyone came here to choose what machine they want and left the video feeling even more uncertain then this comment is for you i wa set of the dedica but this video put me off it and i am glad it did a i am really happy with the machine i went with in the end i do not really feel like the dedica should have been in the group with the other machine in the video a it a so much cheaper it needed it own under gbp200 video a most of the machine in the video are double that the machine i chose in the end is the sage bambino plus and so far i am really really happy with it i bought it from a 200 degree coffee shop and they are so helpful when buying with any question and after buying if you have any issue sage themselves are also really helpful through email or phone call if you have any issue 200 degree even offer a free course on how to use it through zoom they always have 10percent off the rrp price in store and are currently giving away a free 1kg bag of bean with the machine if you are confused about the difference between a sage bambino and a breville bambino there is none breville is simply the american name for the sage company just like walker crisp and lay crisp,such a pretentious dunkin boy,21 48 these all get given away to my patreon supporter so if you get the worst reviewed machine how do you feel d,pretty good a the dedica is quite a decent machine,sir hoffmann you did mention you changed the basket at the delonghi dedica to make better quality coffee would you help me out or i would appreciate help from anyone which basket did you use maybe a model name or even a link thank you very much,18 11 for the summary,i am torn between the gaggia and the rancilio still,the sage bambino plus look like the breville bambino plus i wa hoping to ask james his recommendation whether the breville bambino make the cut we need gbp200 coffee machine review the gbp100 to gbp500 is such a big gap,my understanding is that sage is the british name brand of breville if that make sense so they are basically the same machine,thank you for this great review may i please ask what basket you used in the sage bambino to substitute the one it came with,i do not like coffee why am i here,can you get perfect barista level milk with it i do not care about how much time it take,i picked lelit pl81t in this preis category one problem is the lelit pid doe not show the current temperature,i have old style gaggia classic i have upgraded brew head from aluminium to brass bigger solenoid valve and rabcillio wand may upgrade thermostat,me in my teen modding my pc me in my twenty modding my car me in my thirty modding my coffee machine,dayum were real predictable being,harry modding my cat,this is so accurate dude,lmao we getting old,hey james i wa wondering if you could try the gaggia classic pro milk frothing again but without letting the light turn on start steaming about 5 10 second before the steam light come on and see what kind of time you get,great video so enlightening thank thank you thank you,dear sir i am thankful for the review the only take i wa surprised that you made the gaggia look a little inferior to the breville bambino being that the gaggia wa a classic italian build it is notable also that for both the gaggia and rancilio it is stepping into the water where the market becomes a budget for a feasible ownership of bezzera or expobar your thought,i have only one,hey james please do more on the gaggia classic pro i just got one and i would love to see more content on upgrade from simple to more in depth and maybe some tip and trick using the gaggia too,and here,same here please,one trick when it come to steaming on the gaggia start 4 5 second before the light come on so the heat pressure keep going for longer,me three,and here too please,hi james thanks for the review if i have to choose between a delonghi scultura v dedica what would you recommend thank you,what basket did you use on the sage please,silvia all the way for me after owning a delonghi and a sage which is more appliance than machine the silvia will be going long after some of the others pack up plus temp surfing with it is easy no pid necessary bring up to temp place a plastic container under the head and draw water through until the heater lamp light again leave until it go out then draw a little of the excess steam and over temp water until the steam hiss disappears this u usually no more than few second insert portafilter and brew your coffee perfect every time with the right grinder i use a mazzer personally,james what do you think of the longhi caffe venezia machine i am thinking of buying it but i could use an opinion from an expert like you greeting from chile,now do the best espresso machine under dollar3 000 lelit bianca profitec 700 lucca m58 quick mill vetrano 2b evo izzo alex duetto iv plus etc,i own the dedica and it is a toy weak extraction and weak steaming do not recommend i got it for size not price if the bambino plus wa available back when i wa buying a machine 2015 i would have gotten that instead,if you buy one of these say the silvia how much can you pick up a grinder for and which one would you recommend or would the sage barista with grindr built in be a better option,eureka mignon specialita caedo e37j niche baratza sette 270 270wi,which one am i getting then i have got no intention of modifying it and it would be my first espresso machine any advise is welcome guy,you would think that you would not need to go out and get a new basket at this price point did you adjust the dedica temp to high,what vst basket you used for the rancilio sylvia where can i get one,i have the rancilio i have dialed in my shot to perfection easy to use for me built like a tank i have never run the drip tray to overflowing,i got a breville bambino which is a bit different from the sage machine you have there it doe not have the automatic milk steaming but the steam wand is on a ball joint so you have a bit more flexibility and it is also significan notly cheaper i got it for about half the price of a gcp and i am super satisfied seems like it pull good tasting shot i bought an unpressurized basket and it make steaming milk for latte really easy i can totally see myself using it for a while before eventually upgrading to something like the rancilio silvia,delonghi dedica 685 available in india now color available red silver and black delonghi dedica price r 28 000 including gst and home delievery call delonghi india contact 91 9899332022,i had a breville and i loved it i think it s the same brand a the sage thanks,really appreciate this review and also changing out the basket a most people will do giving a more accurate review thank you,wa researching for a whole month what coffee machine to get wa thinking to get a second hand to start with because i wa scared to use any kinda high tech new machine after watching your video finally i ve got a brand new delonghi dedica today from hubby for my xmas present grow ups can open present before xmas right lol truly can not wait thanks,one of the worst thing to hear is professional background you mean starbucks with portafilter and dark roast duh if that is professional then leave that behind also i am not sure who are the dumbs always insisting on 25 30 second crap ever since i heard that you can not overextract coffee i just gave up on time and thus reduced lot of frustration in getting nice shot esp that of lighter roast time i have gone up a high a 1 minute 21 second and i always aim for far le than 1 2 and i start my time from the first drop mind that the grind i set is way finer so it may take up to 50 second to see first drop per me ristroto is the best one to go for i have gone a low a 1 0 5 and there is no name for it yet but for super super light roast check your grinder first or else it can spoil it the lowest yield result is best taste and i have cheaper version of delonghi the model you are showing is crap with all automatic timer etc cheaper one is much better just punch a hole in portafilter and you end up with naked one smaller size help because you can have more cup at a time and the infatuation about foam duh btw for delonghi the best flow rate is drip drip drip if it is moving faster then you will not get a good shot and drip drip drip mean no foam sorry instagramers,and i am trying to get rancilio only because of brass boiler and nothing else temp etc doe not matter much you can observe the coffee flow and even get good shot without timer needle to say you can adjust for timer by running longer or shorter you can get hang of it if you observe flow carefully right shot is just about time when the flow start to accelerate again i said no timer needed a such for exact same grind the timing will vary depending on weather humidity etc it can vary a much a 10 second for 41 second target that is about 25percent,i got the sage and i really like it on day when you just want to get your coffee the pre infusion pressurized basket pid temperature control semi automatic coffee and milk just get you an easy and good coffee but on day where you want to experiment just change the basket to a bottomless manually time you espresso and milk it awesome i am missing the feature to change brewing temperature and pressure though but like for that money i am still impressed after a year of using it,i am back here because my bambino ha died already after just 7 month pissed off with it forever demanding to be cleaned then the cleaning cycle quit working then button unresponsive now it is overheating and leaking now i am trying to decide if i should go really cheap so i do not care if only another 7 month or get something more basic but better quality time to rewatch this video,i have had a rancilio silvia for over 8 year now and very happy with it consistent shot of espresso all day long the temperature doe vary a bit but not enough to make a bad pull best of all you can purchase replacement part and gasket for repair and when they wear out i feel the water tank comment is a bit of a quibble who take the tank out to fill just pour water in from a carafe or jug at least it is easily accessible checking the tray is easy enough it is right in front of you,lelit anita,i have a dedica at home i have had the pressurised portafilter basket block which is not ideal to use larger cup you have to remove the drip tray,i own the bambino plus and it ha been pretty good to me yes this machine doe not allow for modification other than the size of the shot you can pull but i do like the option of the automatic milk steaming system i do enjoy using it manually and perfecting my milk steaming but the option of it being there for my wife to use who could really care le is great great starter machine that ha built my confidence in hope of one day pulling the trigger on a more legit home brewing setup thanks for the great and honest video james,just purchased a sage bambino i decided on this machine because of it versatility i spent some time modifying the flow to get the perfect espresso temperature control consistent and excellent and the milk steamer allows me to play with the milk with more than sufficient power or anyone in the house can have excellent result by pushing a button what i would like to improve drip tray too small factory setting for extraction awful but quite easily modified a proper basket included overall an excellent coffee experience easy to use i give it a 8 1 2 out of 10,james the sage bambino what function would you like to play with more you did not mention what they might be i am considering one of these,but at the end of the day guy taste is subjective so,anyone have a link to a good 57mm basket hard to find anything online for the lelit,delonghi espresso machine are junk many electrical issue that cause numerous failure over the first year of use replacement part are damn near impossible to get a it took over 8 month to get anything for the one i had i received replacement part for mine after waiting 7 month and told the service part company that if part can not be sent within the next 30 day to cancel the order i received the part at the 8 month anniversary of the order never again will do without espresso if this is how they work,hi james in the gbp500 price range you should have included the sage barista express the one that you use for most of your video although rrp is gbp599 you can pick them up for around gbp400 most of the time,yep i bought a machine and then started to look into coffee and machine afterwards yet just to note im only 9 min into the video but the delicas drip tray can be taken off for longer glass and a smaller try is there fore you,you said you put a 54 mm basket in the delongi dedica i saw someone used a 51mm i am not sure what to buy to replace mine,thank you,the outer edge is 54mm i think but when buying a replacement go with a 51mm search,51mm,hi james will leaving the machine unused for a long time 6 to 12 month damage it or create mould do you have tip for long storage,did not i see you on tv with derren brown around 20 year ago it took me seven minute to remember where i saw you excuse me if i have the wrong person,you should have included in the test the lelit anna pl 41 tem that one ha a pid and is cheaper than the rancilio silvia now that would have been interesting and more relevant,not by delonghi to mach problem 6 time in the service,they do not look any heavier than 15 pound,what do you think about the de longhi ecp3420,why am i watching this i do not even know the difference between good and bad coffee and i make it with a moka pot every morning,i have the deloghi machine and you can mod the machine with the silva wand that made the milk streaming 100x better or you can remove the outter cage of the panerello wand which work okay besides swapping the portafilter wonder if there are other mod that could make the coffee better,can we call you jimmy hoffman and which coffeemakers are built by union labor can i ask,i have been looking for my first coffee machine for month and had my heart set on the dedica then i watched this video and now i am back to the drawing board,if you just want an upgrade from your gbp50 tassimo machine the dedica is great you can most definitely pull good shot with it and upgrade it later down the line,honestly mate i wouldnt worry too much about what this guy say it very snobbish and lavish since he is tasted the best you do you,liam thomson thanks just a shame i did not snap it up when it wa gbp100 can not find it anywhere under gbp189 now,i have the delonghi and have been really happy with it it is got such good bang for buck if you do not want to spend load,can not wait for the next level of this review,i am ever so slightly offended with the comment about the bambino being for someone who doe not want to invest time in their own skill set,oh man it is 11 pm and i just stumbled on your channel i am in some sort of coffee loop for the next few hour,it happens welcome to the rabbit hole have you met alice,i have the lelit been making coffee for over a year with it i found a an exstarbucks guy it wa fun to learn about making better coffee like 2 footitus in sailboat i wish i got the plumed in version which in canada doubled the price i think machine are le expensive here really wish i pulled the pin on the next level machine i also struggle with my expensive crap grinder my next purchase which likely should have been my first i am learning lot on this channel thank you james but am realizing i am not done spending money on this love of better coffee thanks for that too,omgpls can someone request him to use a solis caffespresso pro type 117 it doe a pre infuse and you can not change the temperature consistently but otherwise it a decent machine i swear i just got a grinder and can not dial in the espresso a perfect a i want and i think it mainly cause i choose to ignore extraction time because of the infuse half of the program doe a low pressure into the normal espresso range pressure i go by espresso tail and gramms and still the recipe doesnt taste so good it not the bean,i am quite disappointed that they did not just add the new feature of the bambino to a slightly updated shell of the infuser i purchased a bambino thinking that it would be an upgrade and in many way such a steaming and heat up time it wa however it is just so small and bounce around the counter it feel like a little toy i would almost consider a barista pro just for the added weight even though i would be using a separate grinder you would still save money over the ranchilio with more consistent shot quality would be interesting to see if the shot quality is the same on the bambino a the barista pro,great video a always i have a classic since 2013 with the adjustable opv set 9bar and i have done some mod over time pressure gauge pid ims shower screen custom made ss316 shower screen holder with 6 water flow hole rancilio silvia steam wand silicone portafilter gasket some vst amp ims filter basket and a naked portafilter it is a solid machine made like a tank and with proper maintenance it can hold for many year i use this machine for about 1 3 shot per day and never had a problem,thanks james very good comparison i would love to see the lelit glenda or even victoria a well a the quickmill orione in comparison to the rancilio and gaggia i think the price range would be much closer then,with the gaggia classic pro if you start steaming 10 second before the steam light turn on you can get faster steaming pressure and reach temperature quicker this is because when the light turn on the heating element turn off 10 second before the heating element stay on,domestic steam valve lol,wtf i got the delonghi red edition for 139euros on rakuten germany,love my classic pro the gaggia classic is pressure can be adjusted very easily with simple tool and like the rancilio there is a whole community and youtube video that show you how unfortunately according to the manufacturer the new gaggia classic pro safety opv valve is not adjustable i pull a blank shot before extracting and it stabilizes the temperature on the gaggia pid would be nice though,do you actually like coffee i do not think ever seen you have a shot you like,a few word on anna ascaso 57mm basket work for me in anna it ha evenly round hole and seems to be made by ims this basket allows me to use up to 20gr of coffee and for americano more coffee is better water tank can be replaced by glass cylinder fitting in case this way i have water for three shot with temp surfing and rinsing after shot water doe not go stale like in big tank i just refill every morning and empty drip tray every day for me this work very well do not have stale water or moldy drip tray anna ha 3 way solenoid no hissing or sputtering coffee when removing portafilter all in all anna is your starting point a machine to buy instead of 200something priced machine which look nice in shop and look like good enough for daily coffee but basically always under performs and waste bean which yearly cost more than a machine if you keep track of cost p s dedica and probably also sage allow to adjust temperature of water low standard and high this could help a bit only because of inferior group james mentioned but still better than plain nothing manual ha the info how to change temp,i am curious why you used the gaggia classic over the carezza deluxe or the brera i think both of these machine are better machine than the classic despite the carezza being a bit cheaper i have the carezza and it seems to tick some of the box that the classic doe not,braville barista express is better then above mention or not,before i rushed to aldi to get a cheap machine on sale 2 day ago i discovered your channel and so glad i did not buy it from aldi even their wine are good i wa wondering what espresso machine do you own at home,how doe he sleep at night literally,james how much is a god damn pound why do not you use real currency lol i had to look it up excellent video i learned a lot i am torn between the silvia and the gaggia also thanks subscribed,i have just ordered the rancilio silvia e 2018 v5 brand new for gbp400 with free shipping and i am super excited i work in catering and use a commercial barista machine so i feel the silvia will be a good fit for me personally plus i am open to modifying a i am pretty hand on and love tinkering thanks for the advice james hoffmann i am a big fan of the channel on your recommendation i have also ordered an 18g vst basket and i plan to get the 20g one when i am a little more practiced,could you review the upgraded rancilio silvia m with better heat control we can buy a modded gaggia classic pro for u dollar1 000 add heat control but do not know if improved bar pressure or steaming,nespresso kill all of these,this test could be done with blind eye,too bad would have loved to see my quickmill orione in this test i always thought it is the same price range than the rancilio silvia,i have a slightly older model gaggia classic and have a little bit of a trick for the steam if i start steaming right before the the ready light come on kinda have to get a feel for your machine to guess when that will happen i can usually get the thermostat to keep the heating element on through the entirety of the steaming it is usually not a problem for just a single cap but i find it help with avoiding the steam sort of dying out halfway through especially if you are steaming for multiple drink at once,hi jeff i am looking to buy a coffee machine around dollar400 aud approx 220 pound i drink cappuccino a lot any recommendation please,i would have liked a before and after session with the mod you did what they do after mod doe not really tell me what i am buying and how it performs stock,sorry you folk do not get the sunbeam range the cafe series would do very well in that line up,i am considering investing in a coffee machine would you recommend delonghi over nespresso a a good investment in a coffee machine would appreciate your feedback,hello james i watched this one with interest a i moved from a delonghi to the bambino plus some month ago can i ask where you managed to get a vst 54mm basket from in the uk a i have looked on the net amp do not seem to be able to find one thanks in anticipation neil,hey james could you provide a link to the replacement basket you used we have the dedica because of it tiny footprint and i am interested in swapping out the basket i checked in your description below and whilst happy to learn about your hair product of choice i could not find a link and i do not think you mentioned the dedica one in the video many thanks,very nice presentation dear it is save my time i have also experience with my espresso machine share my experience with this content you can have a look at this page,i do not recommend sage i got rid of it after 3 month of struggle,could you please review semi automatic expresso machine with no portafilter,my first james hoffman vid you are a rare and gifted communicator the fact that you are an espresso machine sme with great communication skill make your vids a learning pleasure thank you,jameshoffman great video probably saved me a few quid a i wa looking at swapping my silvia v4 for the lelit grace you mentioned lighter roast in this video and how i have and only managed to get sour tasting espresso when using lighter roast is there a video that show how to overcome this a i feel like i am missing out on a whole range of coffee experience thanks again james,i had free gift card money and went with the bambino i ditched the portafilter and bought a dollar60 wood handled one with a bottomless 54mm basket on amazon i did not have an espresso grinder with finite adjustment and i bought a eureka mignon silencio i am able to pull shot through a naked portafilter without any channeling on the bambino but that is because i have a dollar500 grinder now i like flat white and the auto milk frothing is good enough for me middle setting on heat lowest on froth you are not going to do any latte art with the milk jug that come with the machine unless drawing antartica is considered art what is frustrating is how sensitive the bambino is to grind size you can see on james is grind chart the bambino is by far the coarsest setting compared to the others anything too fine and it will jam the group head an 8th of a turn on the silencio is the entire grind setting range for the bambino there is practically zero adjustment i am just shy of choking the machine to get a double shot 18 8g in 38g out in 28sec and it still taste thin to me any shot programming change with different bean or blending two bean in varying ratio the grinder is still breaking in and i have found the shot programming to be useless to me so far i am ready to ditch the bambino after 2 month it also demand a cleaning cycle every 50 shot manual state 200 but i have had the blinky light twice in two month clean me or i blink cleaning cycle every time i turn on i am only doing 2 shot a day i could see it having a place in a motor home,or other delonghi user what basket do you use,hello james which basked you used on the delonghi,which is better breville barista pro or gaggia classic pro,hi there i bought the delonghi dedica 2 year ago and been making a minimum of two cup per day everyday honestly i got this due to the small formfactor and known brand name it doe look rather elegant on the counter and doe not upset wife too much i found the result are similar to what you have explained with espresso being fair but these day i drink white to sweeten up the bitter i tried to grind coffee fine but then the machine struggle and sometimes she just want to stall i didnt know you could upgrade the portafilter cup for a non pressured environment looking for detail on this replacement could you help otherwise for the price it is a decent espresso machine,i have to add that i just took a weight measurement and the most i can pack into a the biggest provided basket is 14g afterwhich i can not lock the portafilter in place then took a time measurement and for a 1 2 ratio it took 8 42 sec way to fast how to get to desired 25 or so sec any advise my espresso is coming out rather acidic,you really need a shirt because i am a fancy man,a soon a he started switching out basket i knew i knew nothing about espresso,very helpful thank you,can you do a review on machine between gbp1000 and gbp1500 please with option of dual boiler vibration and rotary pump many thanks,thanks mr hoffmann my pocketbook is much lighter due to your effort,hey james would you mind reviewing the smeg espresso machine it also fall in this category thanks,new pixel yeah i can see why people would find it aesthetically pleasing and look are important it is just that for me when spending that much money i would say that feature or durability are much better characteristic to look for than only aesthetic,mrmarki134 thank you mark i think the main attraction of smeg wa it unique look if not for the look for 500 budget i would get the bambino plus,if you want the smeg get the dedica it is basically the same machine but much cheaper,i have the delonghi i have had mine for year now the reason i bought it is because it is compact and make decent espresso sure a lot of thing could be better but for the price i am not complaining i used to have a dollar900 machine that stopped working after a year because the steam fried the lcd display i love a good espresso but imho you will not get a decent machine for le than dollar3 000 so until i stop moving around every few year i am not ready to make that investment and will settle just fine with my little delonghi,i have returned to my delonghi after my sage breville died after only 7 month po but going back to the delonghi ha reminded me how bloody useless the steam is lukewarm froth blurgh,thanks for the very nice and detailed review can you do a vid on modding those gaggia or rancilio i can not seem to find more on what you said which wa a little bit different from the other modding guid,would love to see a review of the nuova simonelli musica,hey james or anyone on here i have the gaggia classic pro and am interested in upgrading some basic thing portafilter filter basket shower screen and the group head but i am not sure how to identify which product to stay away from if anyone can link me some product that are in the middle price range i would be super grateful best aaron,same question,great comparison so far i have not seen a thorough treatment of temperature surfing which often seems critically important,what scale are you using looking for a good one with a timer for christmas god bless,i have ownd a silvia it wa a nice machine but i agree in the problem with temperatur issue but the milksteaming is topclass now i own a crem one,i also have the silvia but with pid installed and a better basket a tuned by my local roaster espresso tenango here in australia the gripe are correct water tank level and drip tray emptying but the espresso is amazing wa a bit skeptical of the investment originally but now i know it is money well spent and the routine of using machine ha grown on me i would highly recommend it,we lived with a gaggia for 10 year rancilio steam wand upgrade and multiple new pump over that item a well a other routine maintenance it wa solid but we have just bought a new machine the bambino plus marketed by breville here in australia we got the stainless body model which look heavier and nicer than the one you tested but it is still lighter than the gaggia we could not be happier with the new machine it is true we are not modders or enthusiast we have 5 min to pump out our coffee in the morning between kid breakfast and ironing shirt for the rushed parent it make a much better coffee than the gaggia once you get the pre infusion setting right love our bambino plus,gbp500 for a coffee machine is an absolute p s take a few year ago you could get a good machine for gbp80 what is happened there is very few part in one of these thing what is happened is that shop have got greedy,i use the delonghi dedica for 4 year you can vary the temperatur 2 c the pressure is very high up to 15 bar but it need some second to reach it high value so you can lower the effective pressure by stopping and restarting the shot in a series of short periodes about 1 2 sec duration each i use a bottomless portafilter and a non pressurized single basket 10g medium to light roast espresso found no other way to avoid channeling in this setting because of the high pressure maybe easier with a double basket but i do not need so much coffein in the morning i also found the milk steamer difficult to clean i like your video very much thanks a lot,tried to get good espresso from the dedica for 6 month couldnt do it,i am now using the gaggia new classic for 4 week after delonghi dedica see above and yes james you are totally right it is so much easier to extract evenly with the gaggia compared to the dedica especially the lighter roasted blond quality thank you for your video giving good guidance,which basket did you get for the delonghi please s a that is the one i have,i have had a silvia for over 8 year i have all the mod including pid insulation water level sensor a touchscreen and web interface temp loggin preinfusion etc on a raspberry pi it is taught me so much and ha been a great machine to experiment and learn on with the mod the drip tray is my only real gripe it is very shallow and you often do not find out until it is too late you can not pull the drip tray out without tipping the tray with often ha disastrous consequence for me i have always wanted a dual boiler and i have just upgraded to a lelit bianca i will be sad to say goodbye to miss silvia,just to say for anyone looking the only thing i have had to change in 8 year is the grouphead gasket a couple of quid this thing will easily last for another 8 i am sure,what about breville barista you could find on discount around 500 pound,great review thank you i have been using the lelit anna daily for 3 year now and i love it it is simple reliable and ha not had any problem so far i agree with you on some of it weak point but they have not bothered me at all water tank changing and drip tray i take off the milk attachment too and that froth the milk in a much more controlled way i would love to know what mod you would do for the basket though thanks,have you made any change since this post i just ordered an anna a my first home espresso machine i ordered a bottomless portafilter a well i see some review that say the basket that come with the machine is not great but im having a tough time finding a 57mm double shot precision basket aftermarket,while this is a great video and probably accurate i wish i never saw it i have been looking to get into espresso but now i feel like i can not get a decent cup without spending thousand of dollar on a fancy machine and grinder,i have a lelit pl41tem machine i am quite happy with it the only thing i do not like is that a you remove the portafilter you need to hold the left corner of the machine with your left hand and the machine feel like it is warping or sliding on the counter i use the portafilter that came with the machine and it is a heavy one and from chromed brass now that you spoke that you did not like this portafilter i start to get uneasy that i could still get a better portafilter than the one i have which portafilter did you actually recommend i do not see how there is a better portafillter than the one that came with the unit my lelit model ha pid so temperature is great and nice to see the pressure and water level thanks,is it only me or doe someone else feel like for a fair comparison we have leave the machine with stock filter because the review on delonghi disappoints me but u know the best,i have had decade of love from my silvia with an add on pid the odd portafilter basket change long ago,what is a pid,i think that is a major plus for the silvia the thing last forever i still use my v1 every day ha lasted me 20 year and going i would like to see the lifespan of those other machine definitely would have paid for itself many time over comparatively to buy a pid for it,my wife 2 yr ago gave me a book about coffee felt like an encyclopedia very well organized written book didnt know wa yours d just found out looking to your link,do you review bean to cup machine for office,very nice to see the lelit anna pl41em turn up and happy to see it performed well i have been using this for well over 7 year now and i have had no problem with it whatsoever i have replaced 1 rubber ring the one that portafilter is pressed into but i had to replace that in the first year so i guess it wa faulty dry hard to begin with i agree with the review not the best but relatively good at work i use a more expensive setup all ecm but i feel the lelit anna is still producing great espresso is for me during the weekend,hi i am stuck between choosing the following 1 sage barrista express euros529 2 gaggia classic pro with anfim haus grinder euros599 3 rancilio silvia v6 e 2020 latest edition de longhi kg79 grinder euros599 using it to make 4 5 cappuccino latte per day any help recommendation from the coffee world will be appreciated,somehow i came here to check on the de longhi my bf wanted we are tight on money and can not afford to spend too much on coffee but get rid of our current shitty senseo coffee maker i am a bit disappointed to see that the other machine used in comparison are way off the range of the de longhi they are all over 300euros and even close to 500euros when you can find the dedica for le than 200euros i do not think you can really compare and the de longhi doe not seem to belong in this video i guess i would like to see a comparison of coffee maker under 200euros for people like me who want good coffee and can not afford throwing a monthly rent worth money into a coffee machine,i have had the delonghi dedica for around a year now it wa a good intro to espresso making for me but i am now very frustrated with it especially with the steam wand i am now looking to upgrade for under gbp500 are these the best in that range or can you recommend a better model that is not in the video,best espresso machine under dollar100 000,my dream setup would be a rancilio silvia modified with a pid and now i also need to get a better handle an expensive grinder and since i am the only coffee drinker in the house it will never happen,noah eldridge it work well for me certainly great thing about baratza is if something happens to it pretty much every part can be replaced i use it every single day but have needed to replace the motor just a couple month ago burr a couple plastic bit here and there partly my fault for not cleaning out all the excess ground routinely no idea what a baratza encore is but sure it would be a lasting purchase,evilbonsai that sound like a fantastic setup do we think the baratza encore can do a grind fine enough for a silvia i would hate to buy something that doe not support future purchase,been using this for about 10 year very happy with it silvia baratza preciso auber pid,i own a gaggia classic and have used my friend racilio silvia they were both great machine to start learning how to pull espresso shot they were definitely fussy when it came to controlling the temperature and required guestimating the best timing to pull the shot by i e listening to the boiler instead of relying on the indicator light but they were both really capable of pulling great shot at time and were enjoyable to use i did find that cleaning the gaggia classic wa a bit of a fuss since the group head often required to be taken apart to do some good cleaning to get rid of all the old coffee grind i think the two are great entry machine for espresso for anyone looking to start the path of espresso a a hobby it definitely take time to learn the skill finding your favorite bean a well a for all the maintenance but if you are looking to get the reward of getting great coffee at home by paying that extra time those two are a great way to go also i had the same exact experience with the steam on those two machine i wa not very happy with the steam on the gaggia classic but wa impressed by the silvia and this wa back in the early 2000s so i guess those two machine have not changed very much since then,which rancilio silvia are you using the v6 model which seems to be the newest is 15 bar ha the 3 way valve a well their feature mention thermal stability i am wondering if you had this new version would be different,thank you so much for all the great video i found you by accident last night spend hour watching stuff bought a lot cuz of you haha would you recommend to mod a machine or just get a more expensive better one,i have had the delonghi for nearly 2 year only paid gbp90 and have been really impressed i feel there are a couple of point missed from the review and would have appreciated a comparison between the stock and upgraded basket a i am not convinced by that modification you can remove the drip tray to fit a larger cup latte glass mug and there is a basic flatter drip tray with rubber edge under the tray with the float the steam wand can operate like a traditional one of you just slide the cuff from cappuccino to hot milk you can also change the temperature and pressure in a slightly awkward menu guided by different timed button flash once you set it to your preference however it save those setting so worth an initial play with the setting just feel some of these point counter the criticism raised,i like dedica for upgrading possibillity with these 3 button u can change temperature brew time in my dedica i changed steam wand there od a lot of tutorial about it and i am using a bottomless portafilter it giving a really nice result,great a usual the pandemic ha awakened me to how good your detail is in a short video overall,what about the smeg ecf01 what do you think of it james,i use the dedica to brew coffee with chicory it doe a really good job of that it struggle with lighter roast for sure i have not modded it in any way,go on joe rogan,hi which one pull better espresso lelit anna or gaggia classic 2018 thanks for your kind help,best espresso machine under gbp100 gbp500 and erm gbp1 000 yes please,the rancilio wa the brand of espresso machine we used at the coffee shop i worked at and after getting the hang of stretching and frothing milk it wa always great it made really nice foam for cappuccino too which i would always make on my break haha,,and where is the ascaso dream,nicely done and very informational cheer,we had a saeco pressurized basket but switched to a silvia 8 year ago had to replace the pump a few month back but we have been happy with it i steam the milk first and then pull the espresso which usually mean the temperature light come on would that indicate the temperature of the espresso is low enough,i wonder if you stay awake for 3 night after tasting all these espresso thank you for the review,doe anyone know if hoffman start the timer when the second he start pulling the shot,based on a couple of his video that i have seen i am pretty sure that he start his timer from the moment he hit start,james any chance you are in the middle of making espresso machine under gbp1000 video would be very interested,lelit marax would walk this category honestly i think under gbp1500 would have more competition,bradley austin it indeed is but a lot of people buy those machine for the home i assure you and it definitely would be interesting to watch a you say,yes please,please do,also why change the product to test it,funny how there is so many gaggia classic rip offs about now that philip have redesigned the classic and turned it to shit,are there any video that compare the sage duo temp pro to this line up think it is quite a popular and highly rated machine,could someone help me find the correct filter basket for the delonghi dedica the one james us i looking for it but i am lost in the wilderness of online basket shopping can not seem to get one straight answer to what fit for the delonghi dedica,really wanted to invest in a good coffee machine and wa looking at the delonghi dedica after doing a some research and finding out it wa worth spending more for a better machine such a the sage bambino i stumbled across 2 of your video that have put me right off altogether so basically any machine under gbp500 is not that good and even then you need to be spending gbp300 for a decent grinder or even a great machine doe not make good shot so unless your prepared to cough up an absolute minimum of gbp1000 do not bother,i felt the same until i just gave it a try and bought a delonghi and a graef grinder for altogether 350 euro no problem since,hi james happened upon your site and enjoyed your video i have a delonghi dedica that only cost dollar249 aust while it is not great it is consistent and i can work around it short coming i look forward to up grading cheer steve,he must have been absolutely wired after all those espresso lol,he is definitely feeling it the zippy zippy zap of the capi,auto absolute that is exactly what he want u to believe but no,spoiler the cup wa empty every time,wa thinking the same thing hahah,who me meeeeeeee noooooooo,many thanks this budget range is what most ppl can afford,your review did not highlight the problem with gaggia classic is on off switch i bought a new classic replacing one we have used for over 10 year only to find that the power switch wa faulty in a phone conversation an agent from the distributor said they had on going problem with the classic faulty motherboards my machine ha been returned to be fixed we have not heard anything from the company not even an apology we are hugely disappointed i did watch your review before buying perhaps you could warn potential buyer of possible disappointment,bought the rancilio a my first espresso machine put the pid kit in it and it served u well for a long time before selling to upgrade slight downside is if you wanting to make two larger flat white you sometimes need to wait for the boiler to reheat for another batch of milk in saying all of that it a beast of a unit and well worth it,james do you have any insight into the ascaso brand espresso machine,hey james i just recently started watching your channel trying to improve my shot and the information i have had until now ha helped me find some consistency in what i do although i have not yet been able to improve i will keep on watching and trying thing so the real question is you talk about rancilio silvia like a whole echosystem community of user are there any link to that comunity that are reliable i would love to start moding my machine thanks,would solis prefetta make a difference,totally bias,i pretty much disagree with this video you should have picked the lelit anna 2 you have anna 1 the 2 is way better and still around dollar500 and the steam wand is different on the 2 also without using a naked portafilter on the lelit thats an unfair test a for the rancilio it all ove the place with temp screw temp surfing and ballsing around with that get a machine with a pid like the anna 2 which is slightly le in price the reason you are getting better steam on the rancilio is because it running too hot a for gaggia i think your bias may have come through that machine suck ball no pre infusion no pressure gauge no pid do not tell me to mod it modding is for people who buy a car and realize it did not come with four wheel and they buy a 4th and think they have fixed the issue no just buy a car with 4 wheel duh also the gaggia ha an aluminum boiler which is a known health hazard lelit us brass a do most in the higher end there is a reason why your comment on the gaggia is what make it suck ball you can fix it you should not have to if you have to fix it the manufacturer did an awful job and have failed,rancilio team for year a change of seal and i insulated the tank it ha le tendency to fluctuate in temperature,soon i would like to get into a commercial lol machine reliability and part availability are my pri ary concern suggestion,hello everyone i am about to purchase the gaggia classic 2019 and i do not understand the difference between the two type of basket you describe at what are their difference i think i will not notice but i would like to make my buy a informed a possible and james hoffman community always know the answer lol,mr hoffmann you referred to a better basket for the lelit but could not get one in time what brand were you looking at i have a similar machine pid version and looking for a better basket but finding one for 57mm doe not seem to be straight forward,hi james what basket did you use for the rancilio,james how would you say a manual espresso maker like the rok compare to one of these,not james but i have had experience with two of the machine in this review and the flair i think you can get better espresso out of the flair but it is much more of a hassle to use and you give up milk drink this is all provided that you have a decent grinder to begin with,i wa wondering the same,with rancilio i had to revert to the original single shot basket i hate that it is coffee intake volume is highly limited a with ims 58mm double shot basket there wa no way to create an acceptable shot the water flow wa too high even with over pressure valve turned to minimum even with far more finer grinding than you normally get in the coffee house if you know the owner or in roast shop any good hint on why and what basket to use and how much they ev might influence water flow update seems i found a confirmation on the flow grind size diff between ims vst,he pretty much nailed why i got a bambino,delonghi lada sport car,now thats a proper review,good to see you review lelit can you check out the mara x,how to make something simple and enjoyable into something overly complicated and painful just for the sake of it any moka pot will make a shot a good a these machine keep that in mind,thought you might be happy to know i got a starbuck commercial after your video,ignorant question what is a proper basket,steve gee thank you,a competition basket ha more uniform hole and generally a le tapered bottom they also have more uniform flow basket to basket these basket are around dollar20 dollar50 vst or ims brand would be a quality upgrade from stock james ha a video on espresso dose and talk a bit about basket gram size,audio in this video is far inferior to the audio in the first video which is disappointing i would recommend the tascam dr 10l for lapel mics like the one you are using it doe not tend to pickup the echo you are getting in this video,can i be your patreon supporter please,i am currently thinking about rancilio quarantine locked me and coffee shop around up at home and the coffee need is still high thanks for the review,bro the rancilio silvia cost up to 1000 dollar,when will you review the most expensive full automatic machine,a wa expecting the sage barista express honestly one of the best machine for it price,i would like to see you do a review of the breville sage dual boiler machine im interested in upgrading from my barista express and would love to know your thought on it,could you advise on the basket used with the dedica,before it even start i am quietly rooting for the rancilio silvia i had one of those for year before i upgraded to what i have now which is a wega mininova the main reason i ditched the rancilio is becuase i wanted dual boiler and a hot water outlet plumbed through a water filtration softening unit not long after i actually purchased the wega rancilio released the silvia pro which come with all of those thing i am just not sure if it is a plumbed unit though i am sure it ha the option though i had my original silvia retro fitted to run a a plumbed unit all that being said the rancilio silvia is an absolutely fantastic unit and it make such good coffee if you were just making coffee for one or two people it is more than adequate incidentally the grinder i purchased with the silvia wa also made by rancilio the rancilio rocky non doser version and is still the grinder i use today i could not recommend that grinder more highly anyway back to the video i suppose finger crossed for the silvia edit it wa cool to see the silvia do so well i must say one of the first thing i did do wa install a pid on my machine due to the variant in water temperature i found that particular mod wa money well spent and the quality of coffee wa much more consistent great video a per usual and very informative review,bambino ha hardly any plastic the wand is better than all of your other model the bambino is thermo jet 3 sec heat up there is no other machine in it class that can get hot like the bambino it is a small foot print the word is small foot print got it it auto purged ore infusion all in a 3 lb machine got it i can talk for day dude,what is the white unit on the left just in front of a picture it ha wooden leg it look great and we would like to know please,hi i wa deciding in between the gaggia new classic the lelit anna and potentially the rancilio a the last option due to the higher price however i have learned today that the gaggia ha an alloy boiler with some coating and that is a massive turnoff for me the advantage of it is that the boiler get hot very quickly due to the alloy body and small size however i am a bit concerned about the material due to potential health risk and would like to avoid having any alloy part in my machine in spite of the coating whilst the coating is on it should be fine but potential galvanic corrosion after year of usage and descaling doe not sound like a good deal to me what do you think should this be a real concern or is it unnecessary nitpicking cheer,i really love your review please make a review of ascaso dream pid and ascaso dream one thinking about buying one of them but do not know if they are any good,this wa very informative it make me feel le intimidated to get a home espresso machine,james standard is too high for normal consumer the dedica or bambino will make way better coffee than the one we drink at starbucks for people who take it like hobby they want to control temperature pressure etc they need to go with james recommendation,purplemonkeyelephant bit of a hassle right then you have got to get a grinder etc etc,it totally put me off getting one apparently spending gbp500 on a machine to make some hot bean water still is not enough this whole video just made me want to make an instant coffee and get on with my life,hi james i have just discovered your channel but after watching i have now also discovered i may not be pulling shot properly i have the breville barista machine a few year old and the grind setting at 11 give me perfect texture for my bean and the dose on the dial at about 3 00 give me the right amount for my unpressurized single shot filter but my filter only hold about 12 gram of ground and my brew time is always le than 15 second this seems to go against most recommendation and i would really like to get the best result possible but manually brewing for 20 second is a disaster i saw your video on brewing time and you mention not to focus too much on it but i do not understand how you get 18 gram in your filter and 30 second of brewing should i be using a larger filter for one shot thanks,would you say that spending the money and time installing a pid for the silvia would make it the best budget friendly option or with that added expense doe it move it into another tier with better option,i kind of want james to tear apart the specialista in the sub 1000gbp vid,james where do you get a proper non pressure basket for the breville bambino,hi i have a lelit pl41tem with 57mm basket and i am searching a better basket but i can not find anywhere do you have any idea where i can find one,best espresso machine under dollar1000 soon very grateful for the content james your scientific input accompanied by your experience is stupendous thank you,mr james can you put link to the basket you used,trange a the sage barister express is not in there a i bought it from amazon late last year for gbp415,hey james can you recommend any mod that i can make to my gran gaggia style really hope that you can respond to this a it would be a huge help thank you,john gamble pressurized portafilters allow to use coarsely and or unevenly ground coffee and still oull a decent shot of espresso they create the resistance that the coffee can not because it is coarse or uneven if you have an espresso capable grinder get an unpressurized basket and a tamper and you will note the difference in the shot i should say that unless your grinder is espresso capable you should not bother with this you can not use an unpressurized basket with preground coffee you need to grind fresh and with the correct size for this,mrmarki134 thank you what will this mod achieve,best mod you could do is get an unpressurized portafilter i think dunno the size of the gran gaggia,just a a hint for everyone thinking about buying of of the machine the difference between the gaggia classic pro and the rancilio silvia here in the u is 449dollar compared to 735dollar so a total of 286dollar you have to spend more for getting 30 second when steaming milk it is a no brainer to buy the gaggia at this point i have owned and used both and i would highly recommend saving the money bc the gaggia is capable of creating great coffee drink it is the technique and knowledge you need not the fancy machine,i have had the delonghi dedica in stainless steel finish for a few year the clearance is pretty bad i pulled the drip tray out so i can fit my glass under it apparently the current deluxe model have more clearance that the older model i have initially i kept pushing button too by accident when holding it to fit the filter but honestly i got used to that and learned to hold it right i never even think about it anymore otherwise i have no complaint i use it with a dark roast it is been churning out 8 to 10 coffee a day for year between me and my partner and ha been a great performer,i still use it great coffee machine for the money i also replaced the pump that broke at some point not the simplest machine to dismount i use it with coarse dark roasted ground coffee it yield the best result with this machine my pick is lavazza crema e gusto,i agree i think it is great and i do not have to spend gbp500 to get great coffee,where do these machine stand when compared to manual model like the cafelat robot in term of espresso quality assuming a savvy operator many of the manually operated model still fall in this price range so i wa sad to see none made it into the comparison but completely understand why,where can i find one of those basket for the 51mm delonghi,i need help what do you guy think about the silvia pro double boiler for 1 5k other than that i am currently thinking about a silvia or lelit pl81 or pl91,how did you manage to get bottom le basket filter for the delonghi dedica,unfortunately i am coffee lover who love a wonderful espresso but can not afford a coffee machine however this video is like my dream it is wonderful to watch and so satisfying,coffee snob,hi james any chance you can get your hand on the rancilio silvia pro and do a review not sure if i should get this original silvia or wait til the pro come out if i have done my research right the issue with the single boiler is the temp are unreliable but can be fixed by modifying using a pid since the pro is double boiler doe that fix the problem and make it a better machine without the necessity of doing additional mod tia,dual boiler doe not make it more temperature stable it just mean you can do steam and coffee simultaneously back to back fortunately the pro ha pid a well that should fix the temperature issue pro is also a larger machine and almost 3 time more expensive,my coffee routine at the time is v60 but i would love to get started in the espresso machine life i do not have that much space in my apartment so is the delonghi dedica a good first time espresso machine,the delonghi dedica actually ha temperature control which can be set to low medium high medium being default no mention of actual the temperature it relates to though newer model also feature a removable drip tray that give a bit more clearance for taller cup these two are mentioned a con but seem to be simply overlooked changing the steam pipe for an actual real one is also quite simple and only requires a screwdriver and pipe it will improve steaming significan notly also if you top of a centimeter of the plastic piece that is removed in the video an unpressurized basket will fit without any hassle i actually removed the second bottom of my pressurized basket with a dremel leaving me with a normal basket take a bit of work but if coffee is a hobby for you it can be a fun little project,i took away the whole plastic piece and plugged the screw hole with a screw perfect i ve also adjusted the heat setting to max,jeffrey kov c it work quite well i did it with mine and i am quite happy with the result,i thought about drilling the hole bigger do you think that would work,i may have missed this but are these double shot,you described perfectly how i use my sage bambino d great comparison,why are not you in the telly,i would love to see a best espresso machine under gbp 2000,i think you are so critical sometimes that all the machine you review seem bad lol,i think the best espresso machine for under 500dollar is a bialetti for 25dollar,a machine that can not produce espresso,have you tried the gaggia carezza deluxe,after viewing this lelit ana seems to win hand down followed by gaggia the rest sucked the silvia wa the only one good for milk gaggia ha no temp control of gauge for checking pressure so that is a con also you have the lowest end lelit you should review the lelit ana 2 which is the one up and the next up from that lelit ana 2 ha temp control the delonghi is utter crap,you say im going to use a proper basket in this throw away pressure one but where are you getting these other proper basket link to amazon,curious if you have any experience with the ascaso series been side eyeing the ascaso steel uno pid and wondering if the performance match the aesthetic amp worth the higher price point,sometimes i wonder if a noob like me daily drinking nespresso pod sorry would see the difference between each of those machine i can clearly imagine what the gap would be between nespresso and those machine but the difference between let is say the rancilio and the gaggia my point is it could be a great idea to make a blind test with noobs could they spot the difference that are spotted by you james i am probably going to buy the gaggia mostly because the silvia seems a bit too expensive in comparison,dimi thx for the return much appreciated i mostly drink espresso 2 or 3 per day so i will probably go for the gaggia indeed and some latte for the week end will be great,guillaume feugueur let me tell you there is a bias i have owned both of the machine and still own the gaggia classic old model with the good part before they sold to philip and put cheap stuff inside the espresso coming out of both machine a well a the capability to steam milk and create latte art is phenomenal given the size and the price though i am a hobby barista i do not use scale or any fancy stuff to pull my shot the comparison he made is on a too high level i have upgraded to a rocket appartamento thats when thing start to get noticeable better in my opinion since i needed to sell it though i am back at the gaggia classic and believe me it very close to any good coffee shop out there and by far the best option for in home flat white you can get go for the machine you prefer optically or take milk into consideration cause with both you will have to adjust temp surf a little and live with their own special need if your daily drinking habit contain more than 1 2 latte or flat white go for the silvia cause you will save 30 second every time you steam if it is just espresso go for the gaggia i found it easier to control the temp,chikin sanwich it wa about price yes but not just that i really wonder if i could spot the quality difference difference probably but saying this one is better etc i wonder probably not but testing those machine knowing their price and quality expected i wonder if there is also a bias from expectation,the law of diminishing return rule over all in this world if you want a randoms 2nd opinion if money is your main issue the gaggia is going to be moreeeeee than fine it seems like the rancillo is on paper better but not necessarily so much better you are losing money not buying this compared to other option hope that help ya buddy,i bought the sage bambino plus from curry in ireland it wa on special for euros219 which is really great value it came with 4 basket for the portafilter single shot pressurised and non pressurised and double shot pressurised and non pressurised we got it for our land rover overland build so the 3 second from switch on heat up time wa also a massive factor we were sent the lume portable grinder by lume while it is nowhere near a bad a the one in your review we want something that is more consistent can you recommend a main powered grinder which is quite compact that would suit our bambino we really can not have a huge grinder because space is very limited in our vehicle,just watching this video again today and saw we had commented we contacted niche and they sponsored our project by supplying a lovely niche zero grinder well all we can say is wow just transformed coffee life we had struggled using grinder which were in honesty useless you really do not know how much difference a proper grinder make until you see it first hand,my espresso machine delonghi eco 310 just recently broke and i am looking for an espresso machine that would be a grade higher than it or that of the delonghi dedica,i bought the gaggia classic pro back in march when i started getting into espresso i have the same complaint a you although i am far from know what i am doing with milk i can see your complaint with it are valid i will probably going down the modding or i might go and upgrade when i feel i am a bit more knowledgeable,the hard case for the spoon over the top let is keep it coming also the slow motion while removing the delonghi water tank i had to watch it several time to make sure i had not imagined it,i own delonghi dedica but the metal chrome instead of bright red plastic version of outside cover which is fine looking issue is when we manage to touch it very often it leaf lot of shade of fingerprint it can be cleaned but additional work to clean that machine is annoying on the other side i am satisfy how well that machine work you can change the temperature of preheated water by setting they can be accessed by button but it is not quick a other espresso machine secondly you can change the level of water hardiness filter i do not change it because poured filtered wather through dafi filter do it is job the basket is fine but i recommend to change especially for espresso the tray is small compared to other machine to put tho shot of espresso cup but hey it ment to be a compact coffee machine the handle is well balanced on top we have got a heater for cup overall it is worth it price,do you have a vst basket,dedica is low power than hand with flair,just a thought james if you could put up on the screen which machine you are working with might help u follow along,i ve got the lelit with attached coffie grinder load of friend have the gaggia i like better my lelit but they are both solid,whats a decent coffee machine for under gbp300 i am upgrading from my dolche gusto pod machine,rancillo silvia should not be in this group they sell for 750 plus tax which make it 800 dollar in america,hi james thanks for your video super informative a i have been learning espresso making at home i have discovered that i am overly sensitive to caffene and am wondering if decaf espresso is a topic you would consider a a topic you would explore i am perhaps such a neophyte to miss that decaf espresso is anathema i feel like i have been having some success with the swiss water decaf bean,wonderful video my espresso machine died a few month back and i ended up purchasing a gaggia classic pro i absolutely love it and your review pretty much sum up my experience i would recommend this machine to anyone willing to spend 4 to 5 hundred dollar i also bought the bottomless portafilter a must have in my opinion,this is some next level pretentious wank i tell thee,why did not you do the breville barista express,why would you dismantle the coffe basket of the de longhi thereby putting the entire manufacturer setting for a perfect coffee with this machine out of synchronization i use this sleek and easy performing machine for over a year and get really good espresso with good creama and a good cappuccino with a well frothy milk simple a that no i am not working for de longhi but felt to set the record straight a your way of testing did not do justice to this sleek simple yet very well performing de longhi dedica maybe the very reasonable price point get too much pressure from the competitor who know,i could not agree more the dedica ha instruction for lowering and rising the temperature in the instructive it also suggests warming up your cup by running hot water on it from the basket which is obviously to also heat up the basket thus aiding with the extraction process speaking of which i actually think that the plastic piece on the basket is key to prevent hot water and hot espresso from touching cold metal since the plastic actually insulates it i feel like when you dismantle the basket and take out the plastic piece then it will lower your espresso temperature playing with the temp setting and also with the grind with different coffee blend ha made my experience with the dedica quite enjoyable for over two year already my rule of thumb is using the low temp setting for dark roast medium for both dark and medium roast and high temp for either lighter roast or for certain more dense and or more acidic coffee another great thing about the dedica is that you can instantly stop the flow by pushing the button again if you push the button and leave it pressed the flow will continue until you release and the machine will remember that setting i e very basic but you can program it,i have a delonghi dedica got ta say the stainless steel version is worth it it heavier than the plastic case based on my impromptu check lifting the box in the store and i found i had a massive improvement when i purchased a bottomless portafilter dollar53 cad from walmart after shipping and tax and turned up my brew temp there is instruction with the machine on how to do so bottomless portafilter better accommodates scale and allows me to ass channeling issue worth every penny and i like that i can set the brew volume i only weigh my shot when i switch to a new coffee bean,hei james maybe you have the chance to review also some home roasting device im thinking ikawa a one of them,so the sage is a breville bambino,thanks james bumped into your channel and super impressed with how you review and inform on all aspect of coffee really enjoyed it and learned a lot,with my gaggia letting it warm up for 30 45 minute ha been such a game changer better shot and pressure from the steam wand i love my gaggia and i am so happy to have it during quarantine,longrat honestly i could not say for sure 30 45 min just fit into my morning routine easier than 20min,kierafinneke for the record do you really notice a big difference between 20 minute for example and 40 minute to me at 20 minute the entire machine feel very hot to the touch and i assume it will not really benefit much more from being active,longrat the u version i have doe not i have heard that about the uk one though which would be annoying,it is a real shame that the gaggia ha a 20 minute automatic off functionality feel like you need to babysit the machine,gaggia you have got to temp surf the steaming too after i have pulled a shot i switch to steam then turn the wand on a the temperature build once it is giving out a good amount of steam but the light indicating it is 100 degs and heating element turn off ha not come on yet i start steaming and finish the milk ideally before that light come on that way you start at a good steaming temperature but the heating element remains on throughout the steam and your pressure doe not nosedive halfway through,i would give it to the bambino i have gone from moka pot stove top steamer la pavoni europicola stove top steamer rancillio silvia sage bambino plus sage barista express i would give it to the bambino the silvia requires too much faff with temperature surfing the steaming power is good but you have to purge load or water and wait like 1min for it to reach steam pressure and you have to make sure you start steaming before the thermostat click off otherwise the steaming run out before it click back in the tank is annoying to remove the brew temp is not very stable it doe not auto switch off i have left it on all day so many time and eventually killed the boiler a the cut off switch failed the bambino is just great it turn on really fast the steam is pretty much instant and powerful the brew temp is stable the steam wand auto purge which is just great for this reason i am keeping this over the barista express it tell you when to clean it it ha a water level low cut off sensor which prevents you from trying to pull a shot on an empty tank sage really have thought about nearly everything with this machine the main issue are the small drip tray lack of weight so you have to hold it down when putting in the portafilter lack of seal sound damper on water tank lid and drip tray so it make an annoying rattling sound and a poor connection from the solenoid valve to the drip tray so water always splash underneath the tray i have had far more consistent result with the bambino from day 1 than i ever got with the silvia after owning it for a few year maybe in theory the silvia could give better result with a fancy pant vst basket but otherwise it really annoying to use because of all the other problem and i am pretty sure not having consistent temperature negates the benefit of a vst basket and the smaller 54mm portafilter are also le prone to channelling so are more forgiving i really do not want to be temperature surfing at 7am in the morning it is bad enough dialing in the grinder at that time silvia wa great a few year back when finding a home espresso machine with good steam power wa difficult and easier than a stove top steamer but sage ha really pushed the technology forward with the thermojet system and the silvia is feeling dated considering you can pick up 2nd hand bambino on ebay for gbp170 it really is the best machine under gbp500,may i ask what have you chosen for a grinder,i still use my ten year old gaggia classic twice a day saving up for gs3 but still enjoying nice coffee with my classic,where is the basket you used for the bambino from trying to upgrade the 54mm standard basket in my duo temp pro and struggling to find a replacement,now we just need a followup a to which budget grinder would go with this,just got a delonghi for 150 used pretty happy,i have the delonghi i am new to the espresso making world so i am probably not the best judge but i am happy with it what are the drawback of using the stock portafilter pressurized i have just researched a little and i am even more confused my understanding wa that the pressurized basket is so that you do not have to worry too much about the pressure but in that case would not modifying the portafilter increase risk i do not think the delonghi machine allows for pressure setting mine doe not at least and while you can get a longer extraction by pushing the button longer it would not change the pressure,an interesting question would be what is the least expensive machine that would solve the issue you had with all of these and allow pulling a great shot a lelit with 58 mm basket ecm rocket is not this the question most people want to know how much do i need to spend to make great espresso at home not ok espresso or alright a long a i use dark bean or good if i open it up and tinker with it just which machine can i take home put on my counter and not considering the barista learning curve make great coffee or will make great coffee once i master the machine then the next question would be if i want to spend big buck for my home coffee maker rocket r9 marsocca g 3 and whatever else competes,my first espresso machine wa a christmas gift from my fiance a icona delonghi i wa so thrilled it worked perfectly fine for a couple of year then the heating system just broke typical defect of this machine i ended up buying a brand new delonghi dedica deluxe i am beyond pissed the machine worked a couple of month and started leaking everywhere typical defect of the deluxe i look up the problem on youtube i went to order a freaking tiny gasket of dollar5 and it is still leaking over dollar300 down the drain i am italian and you can imagine how outraged i am delonghi is crap never ever buying it again do not waste your money on the delonghi,i have to say that running this test on basket that these machine were not designed around make the test useless to me you are no longer reviewing the machine a sold or a manufactured if i were the manufacturer watching this i would be tearing my hair out,the silvia is considerably over that 500 price among the true under 500 the gaggia is the best machine,you are awesome greeting from macedonia,for anyone truly looking you can usually pick up a sage breville if american barista express for under gbp500 that come with an inbuild burr grinder i do understand why it not been shown on here a it retail for 599,the best machine a second hand one lol,i am using my moka pot that you taught me how to use i really like it,hi i have the dedica delonghi for almost 2 year the price quality ratio function wa the best i found here in chile i am delighted i use it daily,eduardo pe a gracias por responder y tan r pido el video me hizo dudar un poco pero bueno tampoco e que este metido en la vola de barista solo que me gusta un buen caf y la primalatte ya me esta fallando dp de como 7 a o,oscar garc a ch vez s per hasta ahora no me ha dado problema descalsifico cuando corresponde la ocupo a diario,hola hola compa anda bien entonces yo estoy ya casi decidido a comprarla la pille a 230 lo m s barato,im surprised the breville infuser wa not on the list i love mine,i think it is an amazing value,james can you review the breville barista express the one that ha the grinder built in,it would be the same a the infuser which the bambino ha superseded except for the temp control,breville v ferati ferro which have grinder built ini,bigglyguy eh debatable cheaper machine run based on steam have deep af portafilters come with scoop tamper are pressurized and do not make anything remotely near espresso it a sort of struggle per say,bl i wish mine had lasted that long my bambino barely lasted 7 month and a i had to import the thing it is not really worth messing with the warranty i would have been better off buying some cheap chinese thing that would last 8 month for a 1 3 of the price,mentocthemindtaker he literally could not have been any nicer and explained everything he said in a professional an well thought out manner do not be salty because he doesnt like your machine and gave you legitimate reason not to like it and at the end he said whatever make you a cup of coffee you like is a good choice stop being over extracted and bitter,i want to see him mod them,hoy we know a out the basket can you make a video to understand,anyone know of any tip to keep the open water reservoir on gaggia classic from getting scummy and it hose from getting slimy love the machine but i wish the water situation wa a bit cleaner,which basket do you suggest thx,jeremy siers say not to let the gaggia steamer get to the point where it tell you it ready flip the switch wait 10 second then go in with your milk better pressure per him,just subscribed after watching this great video i would love to see your recommendation for home expresso setup for dollar1000,for the gaggia which vst basket did you use for it they seem to come in gram size and wa it ridged or not,sage barista express would be better than any of them and cost 500gbp,for someone who is in the market to getting an espresso machine if money is not an issue which one would you recommend it for house use but i prefer getting a commercial one due to their durability and premium build ur recommendation please i prefer one which ha a built in grinder a well plz advise,got a silvia and a eureka mignon off facebook marketplace for gbp280 had them nearly a year and been great took the silvia to the next level once i upgraded with a auber pid,another great video this wa really helpful a i am looking at the silvia and gaggia pro for an upgrade from a sage barista express,can we order additional kit to replay and cup with friend later,i have the bambino plus i want to be a hobbyist and try to develope my coffe skill but my wife just want a coffee machine she can use so feel it is a good compromise mine came with normal unpressurized basket a well a pressurised think it is the best looking for a small kitchen too,i love my 15 year old gaggia classic which i have running at 9bar but the temperature fluctuation is frustrating and temperature surfing can be a bit hit and miss still a great machine to which i have a deep emotional attachment,owner of the rancilio silvia here modded with the mecoffee pid temperature and pressure controllability it is super easy definitely recommend this shot are way better a water temperature is more constant now you can also set a shot timer and do not have to manually stop the extraction you definitely want a good basket and ideally get a bottomless portafilter all in all for a household and geeky home barista this machine is maybe the best to have from a price tag perspective can not get close to a commercial setup cheaper than this,great review there is always one thing i find stupid about home coffee machine they can only make a few coffee and in europe they have to turn themselves off when idle in a short time frame to save power yet they all have cup warmer on top that can not get a cup warm because they hardly get warm and definitely not warm enough in the given time frame plus it easier to just warm a cup with hot water,got the de longhi a a present and it is not particularly that great it is meant to be a cappuccino maker with the fat steam wand but for what it is worth it doe not break easily for a cheap bit of plastic i have one of the first generation is that ha lasted me close to 8 year,please review the lelit mara x,can you make a video comparing the dedica to the gaggia carezza i know they are not entirely of the same price but they are close and i would love to know which one is better or if possible a video for comparing the machine under dollar300 dollar350 price point,i have the de longhi and am still using the original portafilter basket doe anyone have a recommendation for a replacement,i have got the dedica really happy with it had it about 4 year,mosquito you can change the default temp from medium to high it seems to help,mosquito no but i might now you say that,my gf ha got one too i bought unpressurized basket for it it is ok i have to grind coarser than it should be and the espresso quality is slightly different almost every time do you pre heat yours with a couple of dry run to get the best temperature,i have both the rancilio and the sage and james assessment are spot on no surprise my husband and i live on opposite end of the u and i have a silvia at my house because i like to tinker with thing and i bought a sage for his place because he just want a decent latte without having to fuss with anything i really enjoy using both machine and they are totally different beast the silvia for sure make better coffee but for the price and convenience the sage is a surprisingly good little machine because the silvia is a gateway machine to the higher end prosumer espresso machine for many you can find them used and often already modded i found mine used with a pid already installed for dollar400 usd i think i am the third owner and it still work beautifully,we have a rancilio amp love it we spent almost 6 month researching but it wa either starbucks or rancilio woohoo,could you do a video on basket the different type and how they differ i get a little confused when you talk about basket maybe talk about portafilters a well,doe make me wonder how much would one have to spend to get a fairly decent machine that is nice to use and doe not require heavy modding trying to get a bit of an idea how much to save up,i actually have both the gaggia and silva i am finding the temperature surfing a key to learning how to pull constant shot it is fairly frustrating to pull an amazing shot and then the next one is confusing i think i will be looking into doing some mod because i like that sort of thing i am also curious about your thought on the next level up on machine rocket expobars is it worth just spending more or modding this level of machine,if the price is not a bar which one is the best espresso maker for a home,what temperature should you brew espresso at do you have a video about this i would love to know everything about espresso temperature in detail,great video i see you say the rancilio silvia wa 529 could you make a video for 500 1000 im curious how it compare to the breville express,great review,what grinder are you using,my experience with the following machine rancillio is the best machine but hate the drip tray the lelit is a great machine and is the most durable with a huge drip tray all stainless steel and can be rebuilt excellent value and quality many different model are available including with pid the gaggia is a great machine but they are flawed with a smaller boiler with dissimilar metal that fails the aluminium will corrode and flak within the boiler often blocking the pipe work or causing issue with sealing at the oring between the upper aluminium and lower brass boiler like the heating element on the exterior of the boiler so it should not die if the boiler is empty,i feel like the sage product are good for people that do not know coffee but know coffee,sage breville machine the mid to high end one are great for people that want good coffee but do not have the time money patience inclination to mod or have espresso making a a hobby,enjoying these budget video i think they are really helpful how about checking out the used market i found there to be many good deal maybe you could make a video comparing a used setup and a new setup on a budget say 100gbp 500gbp etc,doe anyone know what scale he is using at 7 01 for example,curious on what your thought on the lelit anna 2 with pid would be it is about dollar100 le than a rancilio silva in canada,owned the dedica for a number of year and ha pulled decent shot most of the time so good value for the money,turm on a gaggia and wait for 10min you will get great hot coffe simple,now this is exactly what i want to watch on youtube,spending significan not amount on coffee outside of home and started to look for at home expresso machine this is so useful and i am planning to purchase either gaggia or silvia,instead of comparing 5 or more machine grinder brewing machine etc i suggest you to introduce only one piece of tool that stand out mile ahead in term of value for the money that is what i and also your reader with the money ready to spend expect,gaggia for ever,so this espresso machine is not under 500 but what do you think of the oscar ii nuova simonelli also how doe it compare to other prosumer home espresso machine namely the more expensive victoria arduino eagle one prima,hi james i have the delonghi dedica and it is good enough for now since i do not want to spend too much more money for now i bought a spare pressurised basket and modded it by grinding out the pressurised wall leaving the non pressurised layer attached but i do not think that is good enough what basket did you buy for the dedica i can not find any with the correct dimension locally south africa so hopefully if i have the correct name for the basket it might be easier to source locally,great video a always i think lelit ha a machine at least here on the continent in roughly the range of a silvia with standard portafilters and i think even a pid so i would be interested to see how it hold up to the silvia i owned a gaggia before going to an hx machine and my friend owned a silvia having pulled shot on both i would agree with your assessment i would say if you are a pure espresso guy the gaggia might be the better price performance,i am curious if you have ever tested the machine from ariete they have similar price to these 5 above and interesting retro design on top not taking too much space but i can not find many review even though i would be expecting italian to make rather good coffee machine i am thinking what to chose between ariete retro 1389 and delonghi dedica but i have not found any comparison like that,a review of the zuriga espresso machine would be cool,i own a silvia owned a gaggia and would take the 180 usd flair manual over all these,please review the output of the cx25p bellman it ha a pressure gage and produce espresso with 1 bar pressure it taste like espresso i appreciate your take,why not put oscar 2 in this group even though it is priced at 500gbp,hi i am new to espresso and bought a smeg and even at the hottest temperature the coffee wa too cool for me maybe it is me who like hot coffee have pour over machine and the coffee is nice and hot ive been advised that perhaps my machine is faulty and wonder on your thought on that been suggested that i try the dage bambino a can adjust temperature and that it make a hot espresso can you advise please before i spend any more money i rarely use the milk option unless visitor thanks,what a great review thanks james i am on my second gaggia classic not the brand new model in fact my current one wa secondhand but i have recently added a pid courtesy of mr shade vst basket bottomless portafilter and adjusted the opv pressure to 9 bar none of it wa that difficult to do i have spent about gbp150 and the machine cost about the same it is made a massive difference and even the steaming is enhanced because the boiler maintains temperature better now i am trying very hard to perfect my espresso technique and using lot of coffee in the process it is a pretty simple machine and if looked after they last year my first one did around 18 year james i would love it if you could do an aeropress video thanks for a great channel,thanks for this feedback,james can you post a link to the basket that you used for the delonghi dedica i want to upgrade mine but am unable to find quality basket for it,i own both the rancilio silvia and the gaggia classic pro the silvia is a tank our un modified version ha been working for almost 15 year without a single problem it is quite sensitive to temperature meaning your shot can be ruined if you do not pull them the second the boiler get up to proper temperature when light turn off but if you are careful and turn off the pump a soon a the light turn on again we get great extraction the gaggia just arrived and i have been frustrated with the low clearance under the portafilter none of my regular sized mug will fit and you can only pull a shot for 5 6 second before the light turn off telling you that the temp ha dropped but a video i saw solved that problem if you click the steam button and leave on for 19 20 second before you pull the shot you get hot water during the entire extraction and the shot are pretty stellar we do not use either machine for steaming milk so i can not comment on that,i have the gaggia classic pro and overall i am pleased with it i agree that the steam power is a little weak but it work id be interested in a mod video on this machine to adjust brew pressure and a pid controller for temperature there are some 3d printable file floating around on thingiverse for the gaggia i printed a shallow drip tray to allow for more cup clearance at the sacrifice of capacity,are there no product worth reviewing that are in the middle i do not want an amazon basic model but i also do not want to spend 700 usd on what wa suggested here would be great to see a breakdown of something inbetween,i have a the lelit but with the pid i find that the internal build is very poor the opv failed and wa a throw away design so there is no chance of doing any mod i looked at the rancilo silva but paid the extra for the pid i now wish i had chosen the silva a a more robust machine at least i would have been happier doing the repair myself the lelit is very difficult to work on,got the dedica and the same grinder at good discount not the best but for the budget minded it in a league of it own and i feel like some of the problem are neglected by letting the machine warm up for a good time but then that ofc ha it own problem soo,mr james can u please put the translate into indonesian for helping u thank you,im a fancy man james hoffmann 2020 beautiful,wow this video is exactly what i needed i have been using the dedica for 4 year now purchased for le than dollar200 cad the review here is spot on uphill battle with light roast which is why in my video on my channel i showed a light roast in the background but usually use medium roast the machine need lot of helping to get an okay shot it wa my first machine to learn the variable of espresso and making milk drink before investing into a better machine i like the rancilio v6 but for once in my life i do not feel like modding the machine having needed to do this on dedica and wrestling with consistent result therefore i think the lelit anna 2 with pid with a better basket is my next machine i will need a larger kitchen for anything else hah ha i just wish the cost in canada would be cheaper a it is close to dollar900 cad v a converted dollar350 pound to dollar600 cad,can a breville barista express grinder aside pull a good of quality of espresso v a silvia or gaggia,after watching this video i really feel like the delonghi dedica give the same result a my dollar100 usd delonghi stilosa doe i mainly use it for milk drink and i hate how frothy the milk get with the attachment plain espresso shot with light roast coffee taste great and i never drink coffee black,tony gibbon i took off the metal outside and i still got extra thick foam on top and no bubble on the bottom,lorelei e yay it unfortunately make it shorter but you do not get all the extra artificial thick foam and have more control over how much you expand or froth it but the rubber wand will explode off if you do not cable zip tie it also not having the outside attachment make it easier to wipe clean,tony gibbon wow okay thanks i will have to try that,take off th pannarello attachment and the stilosa will make some great steamer milk but cable zip tie the rubber tip on tight else it will occasionally burst off due to pressure and cover your kitchen in milk,great review james enjoyable a always why are you not recommending the rancilio pro it had the pid built in ofc that will increase the price point which wa already above the limit you set but it also confirms to me that there is not much benefit upgrading my gaggia to silvia unless i buy the pro,the silvia pro is at least twice the price from the regular silvia probably more even depending on where you live it look really good but you can get a regular silvia with a pid for much greater value depending on what you need from it but i think the point here is that you could get either the gaggia or silvia and later on modify it with a pid that is not really something that would be worth it on the others he is reviewing here i guess you are correct though upgrading from gaggia to a regular silvia is mostly a side step since they are in a similar price range,are you gon na stop making the best espresso machine because of the eagle one prima,i wa actually looking to buy the rancilio silvia but unfortunately they don e sell it in egypt where i am from would be more than thankful if i could get it from you if you still have it,this wa very helpful i have recently ordered a rancilio silvia and i am waiting for delivery now after 9 month of using a cheap sunbeam appliance grade machine this vid is making me feel quite good about my choice and reminding me to pay attention to the various temperature surfing tutorial for the silvia on yt it is good to know there is a modding community out there if my control freak nature decides to get really into it i would definitely also be interested a others have said in a vid about filter basket choice and the difference they make,mm ay i am quite pleased with it the one issue i have is that the drip tray is very small and it can easily spill when you are trying to pour it out into the sink i only make one or two drink a day and i feel like i am emptying it every time i use it to be fair i do flush it a lot so that fill the tray apart from that i am really pleased it ha not skipped a beat in the 17 month i have been using it i would definitely suggest a rubber tamping mat to go with it the steam wand is a beast it steam milk really quickly i time my shot pouring and dial in my grind and i am finding getting the right combo definitely make a difference to taste if you do buy one try and find a shop in your country that ha it in stock if it get sent from italy it might take age that is the pandemic for you,how ha your experience been so far i am considering it but it almost out of budget,8 16 james hoffman is the main anime character in his coffee version of food war both have a nice carrying case to carry around their super fancy and personal utensil of choice,i felt i needed to say this these are mostly over priced machine there used to be no need to buy a 500 pound mammoth not so long ago in spain we have a not so well known espresso tradition aswell if you ask for a coffee it will be an espresso for 1 3 euro i have been drinking preground espresso kept in a good container in the fridge not a a hobby but a the way we did this in household since always now i moved to the uk and tried to find the great saeco aroma stainless steel boiler to be disappointed it wa bought by philip and discontinued they are pushing graggia now with an shitty aluminium boiler now i find myself having to pay for a grinder not easy to find packet of pre ground espresso here and an overpriced espresso machine because it is become trendy in northern european and american country this should not be an expensive hobby but an affordable accesible daily way to have your cup of coffee if you wanted to besides a rant this is a futile attempt to tell everyone espresso is not rocket science i think it is taken waaay too seriously and definitely no one would call it a hobby down south consequence of this is a lot of snake oil and overpriced machinery yes it is s rant,cosmicat i am all about disregarding science and listening to people who enjoy preground coffee thank you for sharing your thought with u,that wa a really good solid discussion i myself started with the sage bambino plus 4 month ago i really liked the automated milk feature and also it descales very easy you just press a button and walk away my father ha a gaggia classic pro and ha done for year and after using the gaggia and the bambino not to mention a la marzocco at work commercial i really enjoy something a bit more manual to my morning routine i am thinking of upgrading this ha definitely helped me more or le to choose thanks james,could you please add link to the basket you are talking about replacing the manufacturer is supplied one,jj jensn how about one for the 57mm what basket would he have ordered for that one,search for vst precision filter basket,recently bought the breville infuser after considering the bambino ha a pressure gage and it bigger heavier so it doe not move a much bought a fancy aftermarket naked portafilter to start delving deeper into the hobby with the single walled basket love it so far and have learned a lot from your vids,the video is made to it perfection the editing wa perfect the way james express his thought is incredible and take of the machine were impressive i have seen many video on youtube this is the first one that i can tell that is perfect on the production,can you review the espresso machine with build in grinder please thanks,can someone tell me which one is best saving watching the whole thing time stamp please,hey james you inspired me on making my own coffee and having a great time doing so i am an owner of a dedica since it my first machine and wanted something to learn brewing i consider it to be the best machine under 300euros since it the best real machine you can get on a tight budget but of course with a naked portafilter and a non pressurized filter you can easily find on the market i really hoped you gon na use the naked portafilter and got dissapointed with a semi decent graef grinder i get some nice result at least for my untrained taste palette id really loved to see what you d think,tsalou2 thank you so much for your reply i am looking at something under gbp500 i could potentially get a sage barista for that price but i am really unsure about the incorporated grinder hence why this one is appealing a i could pair it with a good grinder i am a single shot lover and do these multiple time throughout the day so a nice result on the single is key for me and yes the labour of making each espresso is part of the fun i might wait for prime day or black friday if i can not find anything on ebay,andr sousa im only doing double shot espresso 16gr with this 51mm basket if you get some nice coffee in not comercial and you have a decent grinder you get pretty fair result i am really proud of my espresso but it need some effort and thats why i like it if you are experienced or you want to skip the step get a 400euro machine like the gaggia,i am thinking about getting one how good is the single shot espresso,what is your thought on the belo ceg5311,best,i bought a gaggia in 2015 i am loving it moded a few thing like shower plate and screen i got it a a showroom model for 50percent off perfect deal it wa never pulled a shot once,owning the lelit can anyone suggest any decent 57mm basket for me with worldwide shipment,i own lelit too find good coffe you would not nottice the diffetence in basket it marketing,not preheating the dedica at least twice is a disadvantage would be very interesting to hear your thought about the difference and also a comparison between these machine at this price range v manual expresso machine which also lie within these price range,i have had a lelit quaha for 20 year solid machine i retrofitted a pid but found the standard temperature is spot on i tend to just use the pid a a thermometer and steam temp controller i also upgraded to the new steam wand which is much better a mentioned by others than the old version you used in your trial i like having a boiler rather than a thermoblock and the fact you can change part when required you can also change the pressure which make a huge difference to the taste of the coffee,i have a teeny tiny kitchen the dedica sits cutely by the sink the small footprint is a serious selling point,hello james great video a always could you send u a link where to buy the basket for de longhi dedica please thank you,it is what you can get for the money aside from it being condescending which is part of the charm of james that give me no information what i expect from you is that you will help me see and feel the difference between this and better model and this and lesser model even the one that are not in this testing in the case of this low one i also wa lost about why you changed the basket perhaps you are only preaching to the choir the choir meaning not just those who agree with you but those who we will do it if i belief i prefer to do it by knowledge and sensitivity i think you have gone too far here,which one is the best,hey james you said that you used 18g of coffee i own the delonghi one and i got a non pressurized portafilter 51mm but it is really difficult to use more than 16g it requires a courser grinding and i am not drinking espresso at the end how did you do it,absolutely love your take i really want a real espresso machine for the house but something about using those stupid nespresso pod get me,i wonder what is your take about capsule machine dolce gusto nespresso standard nespresso vertuo,i am sure it is very different and people might have a different opinion on this or not but i have an automatic milk froth cup that doe the job for me to make a good cappuccino so i am fine with my delonghi 685 for making an espresso but i need a better grinder the graef 800 is not very consistent but the sage smart grinder pro seens to be a very good choice for it price 200euros,any chance you would get to comparing machine of the opposite side of budget in the home category like la marzocco gs3 or linea mini o,i would love if you try the vietnamese brewing method,which basket would you recommend for the silvia for around 18g,i owned a gaggia classic 2003 and wa very happy with it a i have started travelling around i need to find a new machine that is more portable if you have any suggestion please let me know an upgrade would be much needed,would love to see a bean to cup machine comparison,thanks james i am a long term owner of the original gaggia classic pid pressure set 9 5 bar ims screen brass brewhead vst basket etc great machine cheap and easy to fix i have had mine and used daily since 2013 recently my pump went which cost me le than 20 quid to replace my question i put to you would be if you were looking to upgrade upto gbp1500 what would you be looking at,delonghi ha water heat setting you can change it,one criterion no actually it is one criterium but two more criterion just sayin,i paid gbp370 for the sage barista express last year so i think it qualifies if the silvia doe you can get it within that price range if you are willing to set a price alert and wait a while,can i ask what basket bought a a replacement for the stock gaggia classic one,it is a vst,can we grind for espresso in baratza encore,great video james is there a link for the basket upgrade you suggest for the gaggia thank you,have you ever done the sage barista express breville barista express a an espresso machine possibly not your normal viewer interest but there many low cost machine youve done before it a hugely popular machine in usa uk and australia and it would be great to see someone of your calibre do a thorough espresso quality thats attainable through the braista express with the istandard built in grinder im sure im not the first to ask you to do a video on it lol but utilising it is built in grinder only,i have one happy overall though milk steaming potency is poor,hey james could i get your opinion on the breville barista express would u recomend the breville barista express or the rancilio,hey james could i get your opinion on the breville barista express would u recomend the breville barista express or the rancilio,i would love if you try the vietnamese brewing method,thanks another great video what grinder are you using thanks,have not watched the full video yet but i have that bambino and i feel it is the winner i will not edit this after so if it doe not win i would recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing espresso machine,hi james just a little of suggestion for every espresso shot in your video please use clear espresso cup so we can see the crema of every shot trust me it will look better on your video cheer,i own the bambino plus by breville in the state i love the machine the simplicity the texture and flavor of the espresso but i did just order a non pressurized basket to tinker with a bit have had it for a year and am very pleased with it thanks james love your video,same here and hit hit the nail on the head i want to fuss a little but not to james level i enjoy the shot and the manual milk texturing you can program it to tune your shot a little nothing fancy it is also very fast to heat up it is ready when i am i do not think any of these machine can do this but i wish i could texture milk and pull a shot at the same time but at that point i think i would be looking at a category of machine that would tripping my kitchen circuit breaker i agree that they could have built the machine a little sturdier with a cast iron base or something i am very happy with the breville bambino,a a coffee machine technician i would agree with you on all the comment you made on all those machine but i have only experience only gaggia and rancilio thanks for the great video keep it coming xd,thank you this wa the review i wa waiting for,get a moka for 20 buck,breville barista express is that moded rancilio pid included adjustable temp from 197 to 204 reliable and give you a decent grinder for sub 500dollar should have been in this review imho,most serious testing group agree often rating that breville with much more expensive one,dante fasano strongly disagree there are better machine for le that make better coffee with modding but not everyone ha the time money inclination to mod their machine the barista express can provide consistently excellent easy to make coffee,breville barista is expensive garbage,hi james got any tip on how to maintain a home espresso machine got a gaggia classic for myself and your dialing in and understanding espresso series have been really helpful keep em coming thank you,i have used two different gaggia classic only one of them mine and they are the only machine of the few i have used on which the portafilter holder broke they lack what a knifemaker would call a full tang and the handle on both eventually broke where the plastic handle meet the metal basket holder i devised a way to repair the handle that wa utterly bombproof you could probably beat someone to death with it without damaging it i also often found myself running out of steam on the gaggia classic especially if making two latte or cappuccino i replaced my gaggia when after thirteen year it needed another rebuild and the cost of the required part exceeded the cost of a new machine currently i am using a silvia 3 and while it work well it ha it shortcoming including a you note it awkward water tank i have often wished there were a simple way to replace the needle type steam valve with a ball valve i am not a fan of needle valve for this kind of application i would much prefer a positive short throw lever to the usual game of winding winding winding on a wobbling plastic knob,you should do a video on a modded at home espresso machine there are some really cool mod out there,anyone have any experience with sage duo temp pro,perfect thanks for posting this follow up video i wa really looking forward to this,how had i not noticed the size of your hand before,would it be effective and cheap to add a few lever action suction cup to the bottom of these lighter machine,there are some butt ugly looking machine here i would go for the sage or the delonhg for look,can you test the breville or sage barista express with the built in grinder,thanks for sharing this review i would love to know what you think the best at home espresso machine is what do you use at home,great video james a always just one thing re steam and the classic what i have found with the original classic and i have found the same to be the case with the new pro 2019 is that if you start steaming before the steam ready light come on you have more steam power here,i wa thinking the same doing that the steam will keep going up and will work faster big change,hi james what basket did you use with the delonghi i have had it a while now would be keen to upgrade the basket for sure thanks,may be a very stupid question however i am new to brewing at home can you take a pressurised portafilter out and put in a normal basket such a what james ha done here and if so is the improvement of taste truly drastic or minor,yes and yes drastically better in the sense that you are now in control instead of the preassuriced portafilter which make a world of difference and allows you to make potentially great coffee,great review james i have noticed you intended to change the basket but i do not understand why can u talk about how basket influence extraction,if you pid your silvia you will end up with an e 61 group one day at least it wa for me let not talk about the grinder haha,interesting that the delonghi you have wa so different from mine i just recently purchased mine is stainless steel which compared to others i have used give it a slight increase in weight which allows me to remove the portafilter one handed provided the bottom is griping the benchtop properly also the removable drip tray ha a nice i assume stainless steel cover underneath so that mug and larger cup do not just sit in the plastic bottom which is a nice feature to be included just found it interesting that there were some difference that may or may not have caused a different opinion of it edit by the way after just an hour or so about going through the setting setting the water temp etc i think the difference between the stock shot i wa pulling and what i am able to pull now especially considering the change in coffee i have used is night and day,i have had the dedica for 2 year and not once accidentally pressed a button haha literally one finger on top would be enough to hold it in place when you put the portafilter in great machine my coffee are still better than at least 60percent of the coffee i get out good place not chain shite really recommend it,hey james can you review some of the higher end dual boiler rotary pump machine bezzera matrix de is one i have been quite interested in,i have a gaggia classic pro and overall it is been a good experience for me i agree that steam wand pressure ha been disappointing though any more than about 200ml of milk and it just can not handle it,have you seen the rancillo pro model apparently you can set the temperature and shot time so no need to hack it keen to hear see a review on it,i have the bambino would not agree completely with this review i use a non pressurize basket and a naked porta filter it made a huge difference i think this are solid machine and very user friendly i love everything to do with coffee but i got ta be honest there is a lot of snobbery going on in the coffee world of machine and even coffee ground at the end of the day most people are not baristas or coffee connoisseur most people drink milk base espresso drink which hide the coffee imperfection if you know hot to steam milk so bottom line go with what u can afford without braking the bank and learn to realize what kind of taste bud u got if you have simple one and you like what you are drinking keep on doing it,can you test and talk about nuova simonelli musica and how to mode it i believe it is a great value if it got modified jameshoffmann,because i am a fancy man d,i have the delonghi dedica and my husband and i love it best dollar200 u dollar i have ever spent i would never spend dollar 500 or dollar 1000 on an espresso machine,greeting from nyc,have the sage bambino and it replaced a gaggia classic i have to say it a pleasure to use and give great result every time,loved that you included the grind size for the niche a a reference in this video keep on doing that please,jake owen photography at 15 06,where did you find the grind size i feel like an idiot haha,i own the lelit anna or pl41em a it wa called back then for about 8 year now and am quite happy with it mine also ha a hidden pressure release valve like the gaggia in the video over the year i modded replaced repaired a few thing the steam wand for a more flexible the rubber brew head seal with a silicone one after it broke and a leaking tube seal i also usually use a naked portafilter if i ever buy another espresso machine i would want the following additional feature a separate steam boiler a steam lever instead of a rotary knob a way to control pre infusion and preferably an e61 brew head but i guess we are talking 1000 euro plus now,you should review the la marzocco linea mini,adoring the way you jump right in exactly what my short attention span need,the rancilio wa already on my radar along with the sage and gaggia but i have just read an article on and now feel that for someone who is coming from brewing with a mokka that this might too big a leap so will probably go with the sage,wmf,i have been mostly happy with my gaggia classic pro and put the often lower temp brew shot down to waiting on my milk steaming skill to deliver but now having watched yet another excellent video james i feel compelled to improve it with your isuggested mod i am getting the 9psi opv spring and the pid temp kit i will let you know if that rids it of the sometimes tepid brew shot thanks for the great info,julian earl thank you for the response i really appreciate learning from your experience that consistency is what i wa hoping to hear i really appreciate the input,sotitofanschop thanks for the input that is really helpful that sound like a much le frustrating experience especially when trying out new thing thanks,mason chamberlain the spring is the easiest thing to replace it is really simple not even 5 min there is a few video on it to me it completely changed the machine i had found it very frustrating to use with inconsistent and harsh shot and tough to dial in with a new bag of coffee with the lower pressure the shot started getting a lot more consistent a much more mellow flavor like really really noticeable and better tasting coffee no more harshness or bitterness the spring mod is also very cheap,mason chamberlain the 9 psi opv spring is relatively easy to replace just need a screwdriver to take the lid off the machine and a spanner of the right size to undo the bolt that hold the current factory spring in and put in the new spring and retighten bolt it make the machine run a little quieter a the pump is not working so hard and i find the shot come out more evenly and gently taste seems more balanced and consistent on the shot a the shot pull at a slightly lower pressure for slightly longer the pid is a lot more work to mod but i also recommend it to get much better temperature control and stability the other easy mod to consider would be the silicone group head gasket a it make inserting and removing the brew basket smoother and easier over the factory rubber gasket that get harder over time and the stainless steel group head mod note some newer machine already come with the steel group head over the earlier aluminum head that wa stock on the earlier machine the steel head is heavier easier to clean and will maintain better brew head temperature stability too good luck,any word on the new 9psi spring i am very curious a to how it changed your experience i am also looking into how difficult modding would be i suffer from simple brain,have gaggia old classic modded with pid and shot timer and adjust the opv change steam wand far cheaper v pro amp rancilio can allocate budget for the mod,got the lelit anita for a bit over a year now and i am very happy with it,martin z hlsdorf thanks a lot i ordered the leveller today no idea how to use it yet could you recomend any good tutorial or share any tip,jrbaboon i invested in a couple of thing a competition basked and bottomless portafilter and 57mm tamper and leveler from lelit a well biggest difference is good coffee and the leveler in my view i did not play with the pressure and have no intention to do so i am happy with the performance,martin z hlsdorf good to hear did you upgrade the basket or mod anything like the pressure control valve,stephen white yes i am using the machine now for more than a year and i am still very happy with the result,love the video i got my keurig and found a 16oz insulated coffee mug to perfectly match it capacity guess the nice dollar13 99 coffee mug will also be a nice match with the coffee maker in the video,love the video i got my keurig and found a 16oz insulated coffee mug to perfectly match it capacity guess the nice dollar13 99 coffee mug will also be a nice match with the coffee maker in the video,can de gaggia make a good espresso a the rancilia i do not care that much about latte i have a delonghi and i need better coffee are the mod for the gaggia difficult to do,hey james here is the thing about gaggias at least from a personal standpoint somewhere in the 2percent area of your knowledge espresso shot a you said great potential with really nice grind i use it paired with eureka mignon and i could pull amazing shot with proper temp surfing which you start to get it right once you have had already a longer term relationship with your espresso machine milk here is the strangest part i had to return my initial gaggia classic pro because the milk pressure wa really bad with the new one i am quite satisfied and still learning about it daily gaggia ha to work on their q amp a let me further expand the subject with gaggia you really need to be quick the first 4 5 second are really the most important part of the frothing after the initial purge gaggia is a wild a silvia in the beginning so if you air it out right then you use the rest of it for stretching getting godly silky smooth milk to get to that level you really need to know your machine and even if you are basically the most known coffee person on youtube you might face some consistency issue in the beginning also a strange part is that the steam pressure is not consistent and i have found it tied to some routine operation like purge wand right after 10 second when you start the steam heat i have not yet discovered the 100percent approach but still working on it gaggia is like a moody wife you need to start listening to her more see what she like see what she doe not and if you tick all the right box you will have a great time also gaggia is the most stylish machine out of them all at least this is what i feel about my matte black chrome gaggia paired with the matte black eureka throw in a black rhino ware pitcher and you got a really nice set great video a this will clearly help work from home people to pick the right machine for them covid 19 is the reason i started to switch from a coffee drink consumer to an amateur barista status and clearly your content guided me through the journey,same setup same reason same experience here i can add to this ensure your machine is nice and hot even though it show to be ready after 5min give her the 20min like normal thermoblock machine with the steam i have the impression that the machine doe not continue to heat after you take out steam until the light go off this could also be the reason why the trick with taking steam out before the light come on might work and i do have the impression it doe work even though not scientifically tested note however that i only make small milk portion since only one of the coffee need it,hi james just wondering what filter basket you are using for the dedica i am looking to upgrade from the standard non pressurized filter and i wa assuming i would need a 51mm basket but in the video you said you used a 54mm basket 8 57 thanks,dear james thank you for the test if i would be willing to spend 100 or 150 more which espresso machine would you recommand,hey james i just came across this coffee maker invented in the 60 they are selling the last batch of it called unimatic sound like something you would enjoy to take apart,on delonghi brew temp is adjustable read manual it is very easy hence erroneous conclusion for delonghi dedica,what about machine that cost more than gbp500 any experience there i am leaning towards the siemens eq 9 s500 connect roughly gbp700 not only because of the inside the machinery i mean but also the home connect app able to teach you about different type of coffee served all around the world and how to make them yourself,thanks james surprised your sage bambino only came with pressurised porta filter bought mine around the time this video wa created and it had both pressurised and regular porta filter the regular one were hidden in the milk jug though so is it possible you missed them,i have a delonghi and do agree with you in every point,assalamu alaikum brotheer i am from bangladesh want to have your coffee,looking at the price now i am wondering should someone starting off in home espresso first pay good dollar to get a good machine or start off with a manual lever machine like the flair,thank you james i have a ridiculous spring lever but on the weekend i use a bambino plus with unpressurised basket it produce consistently good coffee and milk a huge bonus with it is the fast warm up time for it a matter of 5 second so i can make a quick latte in le than 5 min and not wait 45mins for the spring lever to warm up,i like how far away you are in all of your video it feel a lot more professional and exceptionally le claustrophobic,i have owned my silvia v5 for about 3 year now in the beginning it wa a very very frustrating experience if you are someone who strives for a degree of repeatability so you can tinker with brew ratio or recipe temperature surfing is the one constant inconstant that will make your espresso life miserable it is like throwing dart while wearing a blindfold that said i knew if i could get through the learning curve i would have a great machine on my hand that wa capable of making great espresso after about 18 month i felt gained enough experience with the machine that i earned the right to have a pid added to it that wa a game changing moment and ha made the machine way more enjoyable and versatile the pid even help a bit with making the milk steaming a bit faster you also get pre infusion based on the model granted it is about a dollar300 u addition but i do not feel you are going to get a single boiler machine a capable for roughly dollar900 at least not in the u for a moment there i wa considering selling the silvia and pony up for a dual boiler machine with pid but after adding it i realized that is exactly what i needed the machine is well built doe have a deep community of user steam like a beast and if you are pulling straight shot and or interested in 2 back to back milk drink i think you will appreciate this machine hope this is helpful to anyone in the market for one nice work james a usual,intro for coffee lover is,enjoyed a always i am hoping you will do a siphon video like your v60 one thanks again,what about the barista express it is gbp450,the bambino doe actually come with single wall basket and pressurised basket in the box now if you only got pressurised basket it is likely older stock if you only get 1 set of basket you can just email them and they will send you single wall basket foc,really where do you live they sure do not in the usa seattle coffee gear actually came out with a special version they call the bambino pro that come with both single and double wall basket and even two portafilters they charge dollar50 more,donegal overlanding ow nice all i got a 1 double and 1 single both pressurized but i will maybe shoot them an email an if not at least check their store for non pressurized basket,gob side i got 4 basket pressurised and non pressurised for single and double shot,wow really thanks for the tip will try i got mine in june and got a single and double basket but both were pressurized,where can i buy decent coffee bean i have sort of new to the this having drunk mainly instant coffee so looking to leave that behind me thanks,find some roaster near you for the best experience there are also some good online site which sell relatively high quality bean,great work would like to see a review of machine above this level non prosumer i remember my first encounter with the rancillio and then the gaggia finally it wa the gaggia which i lived with for a week while skiing in nz in 2014 that convinced me to level up my espresso life which had been languishing in cheap espresso machine land for a decade or more i jumped two level through to an e61 group machine where i have happily plateaued for the last 6 year but the jump i made is a big one and most people will not make it but will begin to opt for more automated machine between pro sumer and better cheaper espresso device like these i also find it interesting to see how rapidly this market segment ha evolved and continues to evolve a maker work hard at improving the capability of semi automated home espresso machine while the pro sumer market is pretty staid this new market is not and is actually pretty interesting,i own a delongi dedica my first machine of this kind at all i also switched the basket of the machine and additionally i made the portafilter open bottom i had much trouble getting stable result from the machine currently i am using a small basket 9 10g and the high temperature setting with this i think i am able to pull decent shot most of the time with the big basket i often had the extreme of too fast shot or the machine clogging with the puck but that might also be a thing by using a cheap grinder a well problably this ha been said 1000times but i would recommend to at least get either machine or grinder with a good quality even if you are on a budget because if you are new to the art having no experience and flunky equipment will give you plenty of frustration an undrinkable shot at lleast it gave me thanks for your review,surprised you did not go for one of the sage barista express type machine they are a little chunkier than other machine in your selection but they are a home orientated espresso machine under gbp500 with a strong following and review interesting a always,review of seven and me in the future,fun video good to know rancilio is still a good performer i have a 12 year old that i just replaced the boiler on i love it if i had to replace it i would buy another,proud technician of delonghi coffee espresso machine here,thanks i have been waiting for you to review the ranchilio silvia so happy you did thank you please before you give the ranchilio silvia away buy and review it with this pid it also work on the gaggia classic so you can even try it on both of them just make sure you buy the cable set for each model super simple and powerful mod bluetooth so no external change needed and did you see that they now have ranchilio silva pro that ha two boiler and a pid,is mecoffee alive there is a note we are currently out of stock since 31 january on the web page,i have had a dedica for about 3 year and really like it only paid gbp72 though you can adjust temperature think there is 3 setting and the drip tray is removable for taller cup or scale you soon get use to avoiding the button when holding it still but it is an issue when you first start using it,hey james did you ever try to store coffee bean into a container pressurized with that co2 cylinder of your,i have the delonghi i am still trying to learn how to best use of it but related to cup size that fit you can remove the lower shelf than you can fit bigger mug easily,where doe he say i am a fancy man,desiree yarber thank youuuu,haha at 8 21 about his spoon,i have the lelit bianca absolutely love it a dual boiler machine that pack all the feature and great build quality there is no match for the price i wa told that the lelit machine are built a showpiece lelit produce a lot of part and the espresso machine they build especially the bianca show what is possible with their gear they are selling the machine at almost unbeatable price,a video on how to mod the gaggia pro would be extremely interesting and helpful,dedica with botomless portafilter and good grinder is great,what brand were those basket that you replaced that stock one,i bought the sage breville in au bambino for my parent for christmas last year they did not want anything complicated but wanted to upgrade from pod coffee they love it and use it daily strongly recommend,i have the silvia and love it thanks for the video i wa hoping you would make something featuring the silvia good to hear that you are mostly on the same page with the review video that i watched before i bought the machine,would love to see a comparison of mod on espresso machine like the silvia and gaggia not a how to video but a result video and is modding worth it after price or unit upgrade,i am using lelit anita pl042em it is the same a anna but with build in stepless grinder this machine is simply amazing ton of steam power and great espresso shot if you know what you are doing of course,please tell me there is a video with the next price bracket i recommend more of the lelit range they are becoming much more popular around the world and in my experience have been extremely reliable especially for the price,i have been thinking about the smeg coffee machine and would appreciate a review i have owned a pod machine for several year and drink my coffee with milk thinking about a espresso machine because pod are bad for the environment and i do not like french press or moka coffee,dear james since you moved to the new studio setup i find the video sound quite unpleasant sound like some kind of comb filter effect due to the environment probably ease to fix with a couple of diy acoustic panel the sound until about three week ago wa much nicer,great comparison video owning a rancilio silvia myself i have noticed after many month of use and espresso making that i have a sense of how long it take for the broiler to reach the desired temperature for brewing a shot i wonder if gaggia classic pro user feel the same way james h send free coffee thanks,heg yeah,i own a sage bambino plus which i bought for gbp329 overall impression the finish could be better the drip tray doesnt lock into place on one side causing it to vibrate badly when coffee making sage will replace the unit when there are spare though the puck stick to the group head on a regular basis and it doesnt make a difference if machine is off or on on prep grind size or even gram of coffee done it all the way down to 16g and mostly on 18g the milk wand is very good you can leave it to auto froth and it doe this very well it came with 4 basket 2 pressure and a 2 normal in 1 and 2 shot size a gimpy measuring tool called a razor which is pretty pointless and other bit to clean the unit so you get plenty with it,great comprehensive comparison thank you im about to buy a second hand machine considering quick mill nest to rancilio and gaggia casue of their reputation of being more temp stable can you confirm this is quick mill a good alternative and doesnt require you to make a hobby out of temp surfing and so on,love this side by side action if you want the best of all world the lelit pl41plus t aka glenda is a little more expensive than the rancilio silvia but it come with a pid built in it like the silvia ha a 58mm commercial group head i am quite satisfied with it and it is a good option if you shy away from modding expensive thing,you can get a lelit with an integrated pid for under 500gbp,i have a gaggia coffee not the classic i could pull a good shot in that baby and it would do a very good job steaming milk mind you that wa a mod i wa going to do a major mod it i wa getting irritated buying 50 cent part for dollar20 by building my own wifi enabled pid i am a old time computer hacker starting in the mid 70 and i am getting into small wifi computer system like raspberry pi i wa thinking of the 0w for this project and of late i have been messing around with arduino controller unfortunately i set it on fire and thankfully only scorched the cabinet but my fire extinguisher finally got a good use if i wa going to buy one of those i would go for the rancilio silvia brass boiler and all and add a of the shelf pid i have two la pavoni crossroad single head model they are heavy the wiring is a bit of a nightmare but i found someone who documented how to program them a computer would be easier i tested the best looking of the pair and it doe not work i have tinkered with it a wee bit and i am going to have to move the cannibalised part back to the other machine before i can test that one it is disappointing that i can not access a manual for either of them though i have heard of a crazy genius repairman in vancouver help i really enjoy your coffee fanaticism and i am going to have to up my game one of my friend is a coffee roaster frog friendly wild just down the road from me and he is a wee bit of a coffee fanatic a well so i told him about you,i wan na hear your opinion regarding breville barista express d,great video got ta mention that it sound like you are talking with your head in a fish tank a bit distorted,shot,i have the bambino plus personally and i am quite happy with it i did do a slight mod to mine i found a company that make customized bottomless portafilters combined with a non pressurized basket i get some pretty great shot out of the machine i like how quickly it heat up and it is awesome to have an automated milk frothing system that doe not suck of course it is better to froth manually but in those time when i am in a rush it is a great feature,for about 6 month i have been wanting to buy the barista express by sage breville or la specialista by delonghi and since i figured that they would be in this one i waited a little they are not obviously lmao but it left me wondering if they are an upgrade from any of the machine shown in here since in my country mexico the one in this review i can even find are at about the same price point,great video what is your my brew setting on your sage brewer,would be interesting to compare 1000 1500dollar machine rancilio silvia with auber pid mod how it is compared to the new rancilio silvia pro dual boiler dual pid pump and compared to lelit marax breville sage dual boiler nuova simonelli oscar ii heat exchanger gaggia t ascaso steel uno pid expobar brewtus iv r on silvia bottomless portafilter 18g vst basket ims shower screen also will be interesting to compare those automatic machine with manual lever like cafelat robot and flair pro 2,realistically you can not get a proper espresso grind from a machine with a grinder this cheap,is there a u equivalent for the sage,breville bambino plus pro is the u version of sage,1080p,the way you talk about coffee and the process of making it make me want to spend thousand of dollar on it but i guess this is a good starting point thank you for making this passion more accessible i will definetly use my new acquired knowledge,good video james i would love to see this series expanded for example to machine under 1500 2000 etc,is it just me or is anyone else feeling so proud when james praise the silvia i got it a few month ago after extensive research and honestly got so excited when i saw the silvia in the thumbnail i have been wishing james would make a review of this machine just to know his opinion on it could not be happier thanks james,i have been using the sage breville here in u for a month now and it is amazing i do not doubt james that the other one may be better if you want to tinker but i am in the group he said that just want a decent cup of espresso cappuccino without having to actually study up on the hobby itself to my unsophisticated palette they are pretty tasty,i had a breville for 10 year had it on storage for a year and i think it killed it because it would not pump and an online tech wa of no help either on the hunt for a new one and because it worked so well for 10 year i would get another,michael nannola thanks i am not looking to spend the earth but to spend the earth i just want decent coffee that is ethical for the environment and the grower i do not need the absolute perfect coffee honing my skill on complex equipment two grinder would just be going to far for that goal,senorkristobbalvlog i use the breville smart grinder pro seems to do the trick i use it for both cappuccino latte in this machine a well a grinding coarser for my drip coffee machine i have not really had any problem with it at all and i have been using it for about a year i know a lot of people advocate for getting two different grinder if you want to do drip coffee plus espresso but i have been happy with the result from just the one grinder,i am feeling like this kind of person too what grinder do you use with it please,i wa contemplating between bambino and bambino plus a my first espresso machine the auto froth wand wa the deal sealer for me i like cappuccino but do not want to add milk frothing a one of my hobby i already have enough in that list,hi james great video i have a silvia with pid what size vst basket do you recommend also ridged v ridge le btw i do have a bottomless portafilter so depth is not a concern,hi james would you mind trying the ascaso dream pid thanks,horrible transition to the breville bambino,another great video i have the older gaggia baby class which i think is no longer made b c the cheap paint job keep peeling which is a great machine would you consider doing a video on modding the gaggia rancilio i temp surf by pulling out about 6 sec of water until the ready light go off then wait until it go on again then press the steam button for 5 sec to get a little more heat and then immediately pull the shot for consistent temp what would you do to mod it and how much would that improve the shot,can you please do some video on spring lever machine lapavoni are they better for espresso than these machine,i am missing brevile barista express review from you maybe in the best espresso machine under 1k,james you are amazing i have the delonghi dedica upgraded with a non pressurised basket and a naked portafilter you can chose between 3 step of temperature by the way i can get quite decent dark roasted espresso but i struggle with lighter roasted one now i can confirm my assumption too much pressure not built for non pressurised basket i can not wait to see a video of the best espresso machine for hobbyist baristas thank you,do you have a link where you got the basket for the delonghi please,i would go for a quick mill cassiopea,i stopped drinking greek coffee because i mostly find it sour with adstringent taste like when you take acetylsalicylic acid i wa wondering whether you could explain the wonder of making greek coffee ground coffee steeped in boiling water and not filtered,modi magni hahaha yeah we call it turkish coffee but everytime i say that someone corrects me so i will go with non filtered coffee from now on,there is no greek coffee exists so he can not tell you how you can make it you should have supposed to say turkish coffee i think that is the original and only name of it,i have a dedica and for the price i do not think there anything better i replaced the wand with the rancilio wand replaced the basket with the non pressurized basket and cut off the bottom of the porta so there is no weird hole in the bottom also there are 3 water temperature setting on the dedica not sure if james know that or not a that is one of his complaint,hi james not sure if you have seen seven amp me advertised but could you review that if you can get your hand on one,bonus point to anyone who can list all of the various change in frame that occur right after 7 17,pleeeeeeease do a review of the rocket appartamento,yo james can you please tell me about those pressurized basket you got for the delonghi dedica i wa planning on getting one but im not too sure about size of basket or if all handle have the same relative shape and size to fit any pressurized basket i can buy online etc it confuses me and i would really love the help from anyone before i purchase,i am using breville bambino plus for 3 month now a what james mentioned i am the guy who want to drink my americano and occasionally latte so the bambino really is amazing for lazy person like me i am not a hobbyist what i want is le work for a nice cup of coffee or latte i tried using naked portafilter a well and result is good enough for me getting the single basket is a must though,where can one get a non pressurised basket for the sage i have been searching for an age with joy and the sage site ha not had them in stock for the last 9 month,what is your view on the bottomless portafilters appearing on amazon do they have a lead,what is the best or least bad relatively mainstream instant coffee you can pick up at a supermarket i appreciate the term instant coffee will likely make someone like yourself come out in hive but for u mere mortal sometimes it serf a purpose when running late and you just need that caffeine hit before running out of the door to catch the train,a note to the dedica part i have the scultura ecz 351 which is very very similar to dedica literally just a different design with the same part inside even the basket are the same and i had it modified to my need a naked portafilter solved the three hole problem i also installed an ims la pavoni basket the 51mm one i evened the edge to fit because it is curvy i agree none of these delinghis are warm enough barely 70c it is ok i guess but a pid would be neccessary with light roast it is indeed real pain to use i tend to use medium roast with it bottom line is with a better basket it is usable but at this price point i would also suggest to save up for a better machine,wow one thing i have learned expresso machine are sooo expensive in england i bought a breville barista express for 499 00 in canada gbp292 00,maybe it is covered in the modification you described but my biggest gripe with the rancilio is the time between pulling the espresso shot to then having to engage the boiler for the steam wand not only that you then need to wait an eternity for it to cool to pour another shot i learned a trick to using the hot water pourer to quickly bring the temperature down but it is just a frustrating thing to do if you want to make a few drink otherwise i have really liked the machine even with the stock basket so now i will be looking into mod and new basket based on what you have described,i like these comparisions and they are very helpfull but what i would really love to see is a comparision of perfected setup grinder machine for different price range or even better quality range manual electrical cheap expensive this would make it easier for people getting into coffee to see what the advantage of the next higher range of product would be and what work together for which reason,james hoffman alway reminding u that you do indeed get what you pay for,hi james can you also help in comparison of breville espresso machine a well with in the same price range for home based machine,have you ever tried the coffee machine they use in naples kinda like a moka but not quite i wa wondering how the coffee is compared to a normal moka,i have a smeg espresso machine very similar to the delonghi in term of build and the part i got it a a present it can be very annoying with the pressurised porterfilter basket wa trying to mod it in a way to use a normal basket but i done what you done in this video not great a it leak everywhere,i just sold my silvia a month ago she wa the love of life with mod galore good fun,vettepwr23 ebay is always a good place to sell although there are seller fee i am from australia so i sold mine on a local buy and sell site called gumtree,hi any recommendation on where to sell it at i am considering selling mine to upgrade,i bought the delonghi dedica a couple of month back and it is been a bit of a mixed bag to be honest i bought a non pressurized basket which ha made a bit of a difference compared to the pressurized it is also meant i can grind a bit finer a the pressurized really struggle with a fine ground and just clog up there is three temperature setting and found the hottest one to be the most effective a the standard temperature that is programmed is just a bit too cool for me for the milk steaming i removed the silver wand and just use the rubber wand underneath though have had to use a cable tie to keep that in place a otherwise it pop off that is made a world of difference to the milk texture though overall i am pretty happy with the machine and the price i paid for it a in this instance you do get what you pay for it is been a good starter machine but i will be upgrading a and when budget and counter space oh and wife allows,what kind of basket did you use for sage it is hard to find something that fit 54 mm,here i am watching a 20 min review of espresso machine with no absolutely no intention of buying one,oh how irony i just receive my delonghi dedica,a full lelit review,so overall which one is the best,amazing coffee video fancy james,james do you think that it is better to crush coffee bean in a mortor instead of a grinder similar to spice,hey james i got the bambino 2 month ago it came with 4 porta filter 2 pressurized single and double and two non presurized one single and double bought them online in slovakia,for dedica owner saw off the portafilters bottom after removing this plastic inlay no longer dripping through that screwhole and a bottomless portafilter,highly recommend to mod the steam wand if you have a dedica,keeping eye contact while drinking the shot feel a touch intimate and aggressive at the same time i think i like it,i wa thinking the same thing haha,i wa skeptical about the new set up at first with the u shape that i have not really seen much anywhere else on yt but now i realize how well it work with your presentation style you can turn to the side to prepare an espresso in full view while still having an clear table in front where you can communicate without having anything blocking your talking room and have a surface to present the finished product all the while in the background you have interesting thing that add a bit information and continuity to the video this might be my admiration bias for you speaking but i think that is genius,i have a rancilio and still constantly surfing temp for brew even with a pid but i can pull some great shot by surfing thats what you would expect with any single boiler,i have the american version of the sage i use 21g of coffee in a non pressurized portafilter i have been very happy with it is performance,thanks for the review am currently with the delonghi dedica for the past 5 year and looking to upgrade to probably the gaggia silvia,how many gram are the vst basket,choice for different price range,great review james love the way you demonstrate and discus all the pro v con of each machine ultimately you get what you pay for when it come to coffee machine and everyone ha a budget they need to consider when purchasing a coffee machine i feel like this is a safe space so i will just come out and say it i own a silvia and have had it for 10yrs and i love it in that time i have replaced the boiler but that is about it i am aware of all it is shortcoming but looking into doing some mod to take it to the next level there is no shortage of how to info available and can vouch for what james say it is a beast,thanks to james i did take the plunge in a new hobby and habit after a lot of research wound up with the breville in u s bambino after investing in a good grinder sette 270wi i do think i can better my skill and move to full manual mode rather than the automated setting which you can also adjust i do tend to feel like shot come out a little sour and my fix to that is to start the clock after first drip not upon hitting start or preinfusion so about 8 9 second on preinfusion 10 second to first drop and if i can dial into 2 1 at somewhere around 33 36 second i feel like i have moved the bar to a more balanced shot i read and watch many conflicting opinion about this but that is what i have found so far wonder what james would say about this the only thing i can not seem to control is shot temperature i am going to guess it is on the cooler side even after trying to warm up the basket i steam the milk at the second setting which warms up a latte or cappuccino to a longer lasting adequate temp the milk steaming is fantastic in my opinion so i m satisfied with this little device and the space saving is also another advantage cheer,i more often use it for the milk but my family like the nespresso experience,i did not know i could upgrade the basket can i upgrade or change anything on my rok,i have to comment i have owned my breville barista express for about 5yrs now it ha the built in burr grinder and the optional pressurized p filter i personally never use them rarely it ha been a real champion over to you james,still waiting for your budget entry level espresso setup guide at level from ok espresso to wow espresso,i do not know if you have reviewed the miele cm 6350 countertop coffee machine,would not mind seeing some machine from the patron recommendation,i have had the lelit pl41tem with pid for a couple of year and love it i would not want a little float on the drip tray to tell me when it is full that would introduce extra complexity and be difficult to keep clean it is quite easy to just peek in there and see if it is full yes i do occasionally have a small overflow from being too lazy to empty the tray but it is super easy to clean up the drip tray is pretty large also comfortably hold 32 oz so you do not have to empty it that often also i happen to like the water tank i find it very convenient to lift in and out and take over to the sink to refill i do not see how any other method would be any easier if you want a machine with a pid the lelit anna is your only choice unless you want to spend a lot more money rancilio ha finally come out with a pid silvia but it is dollar1100,in my country for 829 gbp cca you can buy super modded rancilio silvia e which is two temp sensor one in brew head one in boiler it ha two user profile can regulate pump power preinfusion ha lcd which display clock time of extraction can wake up in certain time or go to sleep also ha pressure gauge and water sensor for low water in reservoir and little led light when you can not see your coffee well yet d bit expensive but also keep warranty and no need to mess with modding also noticed that company which sell them sell ascaso dream which i never saw before look very interesting and review wouldnt be bad i guess promising piece imho at least spec wise,ooooooooh so it took rancilio a decade or two but they have finally addressed two of it issue pid and dual boiler can not wait to see the new silvia pro well what it can do because it look the same on the outside hopefully it is at the same price point a the standard the sage breville did pretty awesome kinda tempting me to buy one,would love to see a taste quality comparison between this price point and a dollar1500 price point,well now you gon na have to make a video about basket james,great review one thing though you did not mentioned anything about the pipe at delonghi they are from aluminum so toxic check it out if it o k to have aluminum which is toxic for human,my only comment is aside from really enjoying the video please work on your italian pronunciation,james what scale are you using in this video please,what basket did you use with the sage bambino 54mm wanting to get an unpressurized basket but do not know enough about quality difference between basket model and what is compatible with what,thanks for this video james i own a sage nespresso machine and the milk it produce is quite good and the automatic feature make it so good when you want a quick coffee i more often use it for the milk but my family like the nespresso experience,could you do one with more expensive machine like nuova simonelli musica price range i think your viewer are more at the point to buy there next more expensive machine than the first cheap one,what basket should i use in my breville sage barista express,thank you for the whole channel the gaggias gasket need to be pushed inside every 3 shot to be able to insert the porafilter i want to know if i add the tune up kit for the gaggia classic pro it would solve that and is it worth adding a bottomless porafilter,i own a miss sivlia for about 6 7 year now i love it and the portafilter just feel and fit great i have the same complaint about the water tank though when pouring in from a bucket beaker i have to be super careful not to hit the opening on the side where the tube come out or i would flood the inside of the machine in term of temperature i have exactly the opposite experience it is usually a bit too cold and i have to temperature surf to get on it hot side for pulling shot milk steaming is just fantastic the power is enormous even for larger pot i would really like to see a milk steaming episode from you james i have been watching your channel for a while now and really learned a lot thanks for that and keep up the great work,out of interest why do you catch 2 single espresso in separate cup a opposed to just using one cup to catch a double espresso doe it change or enhance the ability to taste the coffee,hey james if there wa an apocalypse and you need to choose a portable coffee maker to drag with you in your apocalyptic journey until the zombie feast on your flesh what portable coffee maker available now on the market would you choose to accompany you,hello james very nice thought to test 5 differnet machine but i think it is not for a simple user that will try to buy a machine for u that we work in the coffee business it is easy to follow i have worked with gaggia and i am really impressed form the steam so i will disagree with you about it actually i have used it for the photoshooting of my fisrt book which unfortunetely is only in greek and all the crew wa amazed from the result i havent used rancillio but i will try to find one and i will get back to you with my remark great video though,love it love the channel just think it is a bit wild 180 to 520 would of thought it would have been a best at 300 then 500 best machine but still great thanks,hi james why the varista breville bes870 is not in the list,my opinion are just about the same on the silvia and classic having owned both they both would really benefit from a pid i had one on my classic and want to put one on my silvia i do find the silvia a bit easier to temp surf without a pid than i did with the classic my top mod for the silvia are a new basket and shower screen pressure tuning and a pid pretty much the same for the classic but i did not feel the need for the shower screen since it wa not a weird multi layered mesh like on the silvia,what basket do you recommend bought a 20g vst ridged but but probably should have got an 18g 20g just seems to big for me at least also what shower screen did you change too thanks,the grindie solo ad popped up before i could watch this ad the whole ad look very hoffman ish,i picked up the sage bambino in the curry is new year sale where it wa 50percent off down to gbp199 replacing the delonghi in this test it is light year better for me although it can take a while to dial in the grind to get a good flow and rate also interesting is mine came with both pressurised and non pressurised filter i read they had changed to including the non pressurised one late last year so maybe they changed back i also picked up a naked 54mm portafilter for it from a certain cheap chinese website for gbp25 which really helped me get good shot from it though i am interested in what basket you bought is there a good 54mm basket you would recommend,i have the bambino myself i replaced the pressurized basket and do everything pretty much manually now a it is the only way to get genuinely good espresso but if you are willing to do that it is very capable that said were i buying now having learnt to do that i would not buy the sage,i have been following your video for a while now and have particularly enjoyed them during lockdown more recently ive been watching your video on dialling in espresso you have mentioned a few time in your video about making espresso at home a a hobby and i wa wondering if you could make a video on this basic knowledge equipment that sort of thing thank you for making such great video,i have a gaggia classic since 2014 work like a charm to day i sound like i need to do the opv mod,sage bambino plus come with both kind of basket if you purchase directly from their website if your box come only with pressurised basket get in touch with sage and they will provide you free single wall basket on top of it bambino is available on offer quite often doing a low a gbp249,100percent agree on your review i own the gaggia classic pro although i have been able to pull some great shot the steaming is sub par to say the least when compared to the rancillio silvia the gaggia is a great value in regard to entry level espresso machine,i have tried all but one of these and would not swap any a cafelat robot a long a you want milk free coffee,this video come at the right time for me i have been considering three of the featured machine for my next espresso machine,you can get a lelit with an integrated pid for under 500gbp,hi i have had the delonghi dedica for a few month and completely agree with the review and out of the box the espresso is simply sub par but with a few mod you can really pull some great espresso and cappuccino firstly i took of the automated steamer and used just the tip secure the wand with some tape or zip tie a it can blow off and you can get some good micro foaming going a some other comment suggested you can get bottomless portafilter with unpressurised basket included for very cheap off ali express granted delivery will take a while they are surprisingly good quality and really help dial in your shot you can take the drip tray off to reveal another smaller tray that scale can be placed on although you may need tiny scale run a double shot or two through the basket before adding your coffee to heat it up this will pull a much hotter shot and have better extraction i managed to get one off amazon refurbished for around gbp75 and including another second hand grinder i rebuilt i managed to get a set up for gbp150 that make in my opinion great quality coffee albeit with quite a bit of fiddling but a i am far too poor for a proper setup beggers can not be chooser one day i will buy a proper setup but for now it will do nicely,subtitle,would love some direction on where to get started with mod for my gaggia classic pro thank you for this video i thoroughly enjoyed it,the most common mod you can find are the pid and the 9bar opv change i know the 9bar is very very simple to do on the level of opening the machine removing some pipe unscrewing a thing changing the spring then putting everything back together and ha a dramatic improvement on coffee quality look up mr shade he ha a store that sell that stuff a well a youtube video on how to do it look up 9 bar mr shade tutorial on youtube and you will see how ridiculously easy it is,i own one of these small delongis you can increase the brew temperature through the little confusing menu of it also pre heating the machine by pulling a single espresso shot without coffe before using it help a lot,maksim kviatsinski 16 18 gram of coffee into double unpressurized basket standard 2 to 1 ratio,could you please share the ratio and how many gram optimal fit in basket for this machine,good to know i do not have to remortgage my house for a coffee i have a tiny kitchen so wa here to see what he thought of the dedica,also you can get really decent foam if you switch from the cappuccino setting to the hot milk setting about half way through it will reduce the amount of bubble so you get just the right thickness of the foam without it being all fluff,1 for dedica own it almost a year now max temp setting a few blank shot to heat up very tasty espresso also after getting used to milk come out with very good texture and there is no other espresso machine so small,what scale are those i have never found anything to fit my lelit anna so well,lelit anna with the pid controller pl41tem owner checking in love this little machine it ha it quirk and limitation but to be good to go out of the box for under gbp500 and no need for mod wa hard to beat i have had a ptfe hose or two a gasket seal and the shower screen to replace over the year very easy to work on this machine too most of the replacement were due to my own neglect or making horrible beginner mistake with it having had too many wouldisposable consumer grade espresso machine breakdown and end up in landfill site being able to repair this machine is my favorite feature pro tip for filling the water tank get a nice polished or chromed steel funnel to be a fancy man with everything matching have not lifted my tank out for anything other than maintenance in year i would love to see a video about basket though especially advise on the insanely rare competition 18g 57mm basket i think they are sold next to hen teeth in most speciality store,can you share what basket you used for the silvia,gaggia classic worked well for me pressure control easy to use,hope you can do an under gbp2000 version soon thanks,i think lelit is the most value for maney good result espresso mashine with just a better portafilter basket,i love my silvia v3 that i have had for 10 year i am glad the hoff approves and yes a pid mod make it much easier to get a great espresso without all the temperature surfing silliness small drip tray meh who want disgusting coffee water sitting around for day anyway and who take the reservoir out every time to fill it use a jug or pitcher and water indicator are for wimp who do not like to live on the edge,fredrik l nnqvist had mine for year too it is a beast i have been meaning to mod it with a pid since discovering the silvia but fear that it will end like many of my project do in piece on or near my workbench for month,how come they simply do not include a pid prepared in hmm i am keen on the notion that a machine will actually work for year and year,i found with my gaggia that i get the best milk when i start frothing before the light come on and i can really draw out the heating setting it give me more power and a faster froth i have a heavily modified old model classic though not the new pro model,would love to see a best espresso grinder under review series a well,lelit look a lot like the la pavoni manual espresso machine is it the same manufacturer under a different name or something,flair v rok v robot v espressoforge,been using a dedica for about 4 year already a fantastic machine considering it size design and price for my small kitchen this is definitely the only perfect option available,nice video shame about the audio i hope you can fix that with the next one in this studio,it is worth noting that you can increase the temperature of the dedica in the machine setting,great video james a always can you please elaborate a little more on this issue of too much pressure too high brew temp on this sort of machine i use an hx machine from sab which is not exactly in the price range you are talking about but i think i experience the same problem despite using vst basket good water weighing shot paying attention to distribution etc it is extremely hard to get lighter roast shine a good a they do at my local specialty coffee shop with real pro machine dark and medium roast are fine will it help if i set the pressure to 8 instead of 9 bar,thanks a lot james i have got a gaggia that i have had for over 15 year good a new i did swap put the old panarello wand for a sylvia one i love it i am also glad that i am a black coffee drinker because the steaming is a bit slow and i remember ftom age ago it would steam three coffee before it needed a rest it currently my faithful workplace workhorse,hi james just some input on your new studio setting i feel you are using a way too short depth of field and what happens is a your camera is focused on the machine and a you are behind it it make you slightly out of focus lacking sharpness and giving the idea that the video quality is not so good specially considering the we usually look more at you than at the machine a your hair is so perfect try adjusting your aperture specially on the genus wide shot you can play more with the aperture on the close up shot look nice also i fell that the colour are lacking some vibrance or maybe it is just too cold anyway that is just my feeling other than that your video are amazing a usual thanks,i have the lelit pl41plus glenda the driptray is equally annoying a the one on the anna however i bought it for a bit more than the silvia would cost here but it ha 58mm portafilter pid and a 300ml boiler selenoid valve the build is solid and all stainless housing i have never used the silvia but looking at the review i think it is completely overrated it is not thermally stable and the frame can rust and it will lelit are a bit lesser known still but the value for the money is the abosult best in the eu at least regarding the dedica pushing button while locking the portafilter yes happens all the time i make coffee at a friend place regarding the clearance under the bambino brewhead le likely for people using scale more likely for latte glass,the rancilio doe offer a pid option but a you said it add a couple of hundred dollar to the price,your thought on this,crossland cc1,i have a bambino plus that wa gifted to me at first i really enjoyed the ease of getting an okay milk based drink then i upgraded my grinder then i upgraded the basket milked based drink went from okay to wonderful then i stopped drinking milk based drink and started drinking strictly espresso then i moved from darker roast to lighter roast i am grateful for my bambino and will use and learn a much a i can about espresso but i have learned i do like to tinker i do like to work hard at honing a craft and i do see the bambino is limitation i am looking forward to future upgrade just down that espresso rabbit hole over there,i wonder if i just missed something but did he explain why the sage bambino struggled with lighter roast,he did not but other youtube video have suggested the water temp is a bit low apparently the pid is set at 200f 93c which can be a bit low for lighter roast james doe explain the link between water temp and roast in another video about brew temperature,try gloria jean coffee,breville beat all of these,i find that strange the sage is the same machine sold a breville bambino plus in other market,first many greeting to you james from saudi arabia i am big fan of you i am an owner of the dedica and it did a great job if you know all of it secret like replace the basket you will find a mind blowing result from it and also when you take out the metal bart of the steam wand and tight the rubber you will be surprised by the result so please make another review to this great machine,i own the breville bambino plus for a little over a year and have had to replace the portofilter my pet peeve the pressurized filter basket get stuck to the group head often breville recommends removing the group head and cleaning the rubber gasket often like after every 15 shot that mean unplugging removing the water tank turning the machine upside down and removing the group head assembly with a screw driver and pulling the rubber gasket out with a butter knife that is bloody ridiculous wonder what vst basket he used james throw a dog a bone,this is really educational i love your video,i used to own miss silvia and had good time just the temperature let me down sometimes switched to lelit kate lelit kate cost me a bit of the buck and i have to wait for 2 month to get it delivered to sydney from italy i have never been so eager in my life looking for the next day spending 20 min making a cup of cappuccino so much pleasure working with lelit,how do the end result coffee on cup of any of these compare to the manual espresso maker like flair rok robot are they pretty similar close enough or you can clearly tell mhh this one is the one from the manual,i have the baby gaggia any tip for it tqsm,that machine run at high pressure and allowed me to use a finer grind setting is this a good thing or not from the way james said it it seemed to be a good thing i am asking because my lelit elizabeth run at 11 bar with the blind filter basket and i wonder if i should lower the pressure,thank u,plz give me any one a a gift,i invested in the bambino and could not be happier i love good coffee but do not have the time to really spend too long getting it done so it is the perfect fit,c b i had one which broke down customer support wa amazing had a new one within a week and the coffee is superb,review of breville bambino plus are bad many breaking down within month customer support nonexistent i wa tempted but after reading all horrific experience i would rather spend a little more but the fact that breville customer support is so bad i rule out all the higher up machine by breville,i own a gaggia classic for about a month or 2 now and i love it one of the reason i picked it wa that i could always add a pid if i wanted more control problem is where to start a a newbie in espresso it is a hard thing to figure out bluetooth controller or not and what brand are good what do i need to keep in mind when in installing it google and reddit help me out a lot but there are a lot of opinion out there and i have no idea who to trust not that i want to force you into some resaerch since you are introducing me into this world of coffee in a lovely way already but how about a video where you take u down the modding rabbit hole the do is and do nots what to look for benefit of certain technique i suppose i am not the only one who considered the silvia classic because of the modding feature keep up the awesome work,thanks for the insite on this james a someone who ha just begun there espresso journey this video pointed out some issue i didnt know i wa facing first the pressurized portafilter ha to go i havent heard u say temperature surfing before and i have no idea at what pressure my espresso machine us never thought about modifying a machine like this sound cool if you could make a video about temp surfing and using the pressure u have high or low i feel that it would fit well in ur espresso playlist,there are lelit model for around the silvia s price with temperature control and depending on region also preinfusion you should really keep the brand in mind for other video going forward thanks for the a always great video,13 27 the lelit actually also got a solenoid valve but the release is hidden inside the case if you remove the drip tray straight after a shot it sometimes still drip on to the metal there,i m wondering if the lelit ha the same temperature issue like the gaggia or the rancilio,and a brass boiler which normally never break v aluminium,i am ready for expresso 58mm machine review for those costing under one thousand pound next,i own the gaggia classic pro i have changed out the portafilter to the bottomless type which i prefer i agree with it wandering temperature and under powered steam wand pressure i can make okay flat white latt drink but i use my breville frothing machine when i want a nice frothy drink,,i have a sage bambino but can not find an unpressurised basket where do you get yours,which is the best quality espresso made since i do not like coffee with milk i need a machine that make good espresso,1 great video 2 i own an old gaggia classic from the early 2000 is made in italy are they any different also my non pressurized basket come with this little black pin that sits just below the basket is it a must 3 what is the best way to measure the pressure of the classic is it common for them to lose pressure consistency over the year trying to better understand the condition of this machine thanks,where can i get a 53mm vst basket for a sage barista express,what basket did you use for the delonghi dedica and what is the size,3 53 do not tell me that drip tray doe not have a face in it and he just poked it in it eye and ripped it face off,have had the delonghi dedica since the model wa introduced use it everyday and work flawlessly have never never had issue with it is wieght or having to have issue with holding while attaching the basket respectfuly imho a little too much drama expressed in the vid take up about zero real estate on the countertop love the idea of the basket upgrade thank you very much,did you try taking the weird nozzle off the delonghi it make a huge difference,i have the gaggia classic pro and to have a good pressure to steam the milk i need to wait for the red light to turn on and go off twice,were any of these dual boiler,i have the silvia she is my espesso wife and i love her very dearly,hear hear i am moving amp can not see a spot for my silvia the new place ha a pod machine i am very worried,guessing it will be the gaggia,i once owned the delonghi and i experienced the same problem with it is shot you did with light roast the shot always came out sour and harsh and we are not really enjoyable now i updated my setup and own a niche zero amp a rocket mozzafiato type v and interestingly my grindsettings are mid to end 10 for really nice short of dark and light bean so far away from 25 to 28 doe someone have similar experience with the niche and machine in this price range,the delonghi ha 3 temperature setting since you said it doe not run at a high brew temperature would you suggest putting it at the highest setting,you advice to buy two machine and modify already after buy them or buy lelit which is no need to tweek without doing anything except replacing filter am i right,the fan will finally let him have peace,best dollar10 000 espresso machine next please,can we get two line about the difference between steaming milk and frothing it what use case exist for each is one better than the other,hey james could we please turn auto caption on a a deaf person i find it very difficult to watch video without caption even if they are slightly off inaccurate,this video is 7 month old so i do not know if it changed in that while but they work for me now and do not even seem automatic to be,recklessintent preach,this thread is a valuable snapshot for future historian to understand 2021 turn out the comment were never turned off the server just hadnt generated yet queue reply misunderstanding the reported issue that wasnt even an issue and we ended up with identity polictics and virtue signalling,clx ma they do not automatically turn on during the video playing by automatic they mean that they are automatically generated by an algorithm lol,i wish lelit is sold in my country seems like a good value for the money,lelit is one of best value for the money the glenda come with a 58 mm portafilter and their victoria ha a pid and pressure gauge,how about the lelit pl41tem which ha both pid and pressure gauge built in it is still within gbp500 it seems to be a compelling package,thank you for your video i recently purchased the rancillio silvia i looked very closely at the lelit gaggia and silvia i have been using my silvia since may and i have to say there wa a huge learning curve i had never made espresso before so i had a lot to learn i taught myself by reading and watching video i agree about the temp and steam power i have learned to just purge a little of that steamy water before i place the portafilter overall i am very happy with my purchase and feel it allows me to continue to grow a a hobbyist i learned that rancillio just came out with the pro it is a dual boiler with pid all good thing but the price point is more than double i think i will just stick with my original silvia thanks again for your great video,have a gaggia classic for 10 year and it is great did a pressure mod and upgraded the portafilter and basket do not do milk so no issue there kinda want it to break though to upgrade a gbp500 gbp1200 video would be very cool,i have a delonghi dedica would love a lesson on milk texturing with it i have almost given up trying to do latte art a it seems impossible,try to switch from capuccino mode to hot milk mode when you have incorporated enough air and then try to make it roll till it is hot enough you could also take off the attachment and steam with the rubber part inside of it if you want really great textured milk get a silvia wand and install it,thank you i would love to see a bezzera machine go through your hand,a a former espresso machine mechanic the rancilio is the only serious machine here very robust and ha a large boiler for the price it just run a little too hot by default but you can fix that simply enough,like you video,even cheapeset one cost too much in my country nice to watch anyway maybe someday somewhere i will get one of these,wondering why you missed the barista express and took the bambino instead seems perfect for this category,i wa lose to bug the dedica you changed my mind and also looked like it wa the loudest,i have the bambino and really love it a you noted i am a person who want to make milk based drink without getting a new hobie the auto milk function is truly awesome for the majority of the time i take my coffee to go the only thing i have really found is flushing the group head prior to attaching the porta filter really reduces the effort needed to lock it in,i have the delonghi and i might say i have never felt so offended by something i totally agree with how could i make the most of it,delonghi facebook group probably a lot of people mod their delonghis,what dose did james use for each shot i may just have missed this,great review excellent information just did a quick search in u de longhi dedica dollar329 breville sage bambino plus dollar499 gaggia classic pro dollar499 lelit anna dollar629 rancilio silvia dollar795,do you wear two different apple watch bracelet part milanese steel on the back elastomer loop on top,finally a video for the people,modding would be a great video please consider doing one,great review i got my delonghi dedica for a year now and i can say it is good for the money it need preheating and the shot get much better a for the milk frothing hit the steam button right after you pulled the espresso shot which will make it so much better too,how do you pre heat yours if i may ask,do a 500 1000 gbp review,doe anybody think any of these would work well for a small coffee shop,kerem a you probably understand i am no expert and not really qualified to give any meaningful advice if you still want my input i can think out loud first i would figure out how many customer and how much coffee you have potential to sell in peak hour from that you need to determine what your ambition are is it good enough to serve some hot brown drink or do you want to be a high end shop will you serve coffee to take away or only seated customer i imagine coffee to go customer are more in a hurry delay may not be acceptable will you offer both single and double shot coffee in that case you may want to look at a dual brew head machine what if the machine break down can you afford to stop serving while getting the machine fixed maybe you need a professional service agreement that guarantee next day repair do you have time to refill the water tank and empty the spill tray or do you need a plumbed in machine my gaggia kept giving me problem several time a valve wa blocked with some coffe ground the water flow almost stopped and the coffee tasted crap got bored of disassembling the machine to clean out the valve i now use a prosumer machine bezzera unica pid it is a single boiler dual use machine like the one tested here perfect for me who only drink espresso le than ideal for milk based drink if i wa a milk drinker i probably would have bought a heat exchanger hx machine it can deliver coffee and steam without the wait but is le temperature stable and may need purging to get correct brew temperature for home use that is fine if the coffee taste bad you can always make a new cup for a professional service that could ruin reputation example rocket appartamento a dual boiler is more expensive but ha separate system for coffee and steam and with a pid digital temperature controller you can be reasonably sure the temperature will be correct example izzo myway alex duetto and rancilio silvia pro edit this is the brand new big brother of the silvia tested in this video there are a ton of macines to choose from in this price range most if not all are good but have different strength and weakness hope someone with more relevant experience can give you some sound advice good luck english is not my first language but i hope this wa understandable greeting from norway,zooloo73 thanks for your response could you give me an example of what would that fulfills these parameter aside from the gaggia,depends on how you define small le than 10 cup hour maybe i have never worked in a coffee shop but i used a gaggia classic at home for many year i drink mostly black espresso so for me it wa not an issue but it take a long time to switch between coffee and steam and back for a business i would look at a small heat exchanger or dual boiler machine,we are trying to get good espresso here in these thing are worthless amen non pressurized basket can not make espresso,hi james big fan thank you for producing such fantastic and informative content question which size of vst basket did you use with the gaggia classic there i have one on order and would love to follow your advice on replacing the basket but i am not sure which size would fit into the portafilter i am looking at either the 18g or 20g and would prefer to get the biggest possible so i could potentially pull triple shot for those morning where i just need more caffeine to get going thanks in advance,it take around 45 second for gaggia to get up to full steam power that is when the steam light turn on if you start steaming at around 40 second the light will not be on and so you get steady steam power,i had a silvia a my first prosumer an absolute legend of a machine you do have to surf the boiler cycle and there is a massive community out there but a you say she held her value now on an expobar brutus the name doe him justice what a brute,i think you missed one of the most important thing in making an espresso which is having a constant pressure of 9bars we do not know which one ha an over pressure valve and which one doe not have one,i own a dedica and everything james said about it is true milk frothing is really inconsistent the wand is very unorthodox especially if you froth with a standard steaming wand and not a panarello one with the dedica espresso is questionable too very inconsistent light roast are a nightmare indeed and a someone who enjoys really light roasted coffee you get alot of acidity with the dedica although for a starting machine it will get your foot on the door of espresso machine ive had surprisingly good milk froth good tasting medium to dark roasted coffee and a neutral over all experience the dedica isnt that bad but it also not good for the price it really meant for you to get into the world of latte art and espresso making but it not the machine you would have in a cafe or small coffee shop hope this help,great video james a usual i have the gaggia baby twin which i bought for the twin boiler and like you said with the classic pro the steaming pressure is woeful could you do a video on milk steaming please a i have never been able to get the milk to a good quality to do latte art i have resulted in buying a whisk wand whatever you want to call it which actually doe a great job but am annoyed that i spent so much on a machine and i can pee with higher pressure,if you like tinkering the silvia is really great i have it for 8 year it is a monster i installed a pid and the temperature surfing go away i love it to bit,i just bought the delonghi and i do not know if you saw but you can program on it water temperature and liquid quantity considering you changed the cup you should have changed the water setting onal delongi take in 7g and you put 18 allsoo there is programing for water hardness no idea what it doe but soft normal and hard,i have no problem with in depth tutorial but for a beginner i need something simple with no mode just open the box and use i think i will keep going to my local coffee shop,james i have got to know how are you not jumping off the wall after 40 shot a video,bought a delonghi 7 year ago a my first espresso machine did not really know about espresso or coffee in general back then so i just went with the most cost friendly option now while i am learning more about espresso and latte art definately regret the decision back then but also at the same time i am not ready to invest in a new machine so just currently trying to make some modification on the delonghi to make the whole coffee experience a bit more pleasant,no barista express i guess that is basically the sage with a grinder,barista express is over gbp500,if you set temperature in delonghi dedica coffee is pretty good also extraction time can be setted and for cappuccino i can make silky foam only on hot milk setting so i can not agree with all said in video i know he is a pro but i think he didnt read all the instruction for dedica,sage breville i have one,how about bean to cup,great video a always just wondering why you did not talk about the lelit anna pl41tem with pid it is still under 500gbp but ha a huge advantage over the competition with it is integrated pid imo,16 10 if you want something to more easily pour latter art here it is a struggle proceeds to pour better latte art than i can on my breville dual boiler rgggg,cameron knowles it is a wonderful machine i am just still working in my latte art user error not machine,i just got one how is it,doe anyone else want a james hoffman coffee podcast,i am using a silvia together with a mazzer mini electronic great combination temperature surfing is something that you start doing naturally in my routine i fill the cup with water from the portafilter before grinding it warms the portafilter and the cup after grinding the machine seems to be at the right temperature for my taste these thing end up adding to the pleasure of using it,really appreciate you and your video great overall comparison i think your gaggia is not working a it should whole latte love did a recent comparison of the classic pro silvia and bezzera hobby and the gaggia clocked in at 27 second on the milk steaming silvia at 20 second which match up with your test i have a gaggia and it never take more than 30 second this just make me think there is something not working a it should with your gaggia classic pro,had a silvia for 4 year and used nearly every day incredible machine but did add a pid to control temp and load of other factor with phone via bluetooth i get used to knowing when i need to fill up tank and use a plastic beaker to catch water so drip tray not really used a a bit of a faff to empty it great review james you are spot on,you forgot to mention that you can run the ranchilio dry and thereby burning it out it doe not have the safety feature of the gaggia,delonghi dedica 685 i bought about 4 month ago i got used to the industrial steam pipe so strange but u can make it happen just it feel like balancing on a rope the portafilter is a bad joke but u can modify it the temperature can be adjusted low mid and high my water is very hard so i have added the softener filter i had to descale it twice so far sometimes if i go too fine or i press the coffee powder too much the ulka pump get stuck it becomes very low on noise and it stop creating pressure especially since i did not change the high pressure inlet in the portafilter yet if the pump get stuck i have to pull 2 double espresso shot without the portafilter on so only water come out from the machine then i can use it again a new it is an ok machine i like the coffee with plenty milk so i do not feel too much if the coffee would be too bitter or something for me it is good enough and relatively easy to use i use it with a graef coffee grinder 800 at around 20 grind size,really helpful and informative video thought about the gaggia for a while now,can you show u this porta filter sneeze,it is a shame you did not have the sage breville barista express,chase madsen i am curious why you say the barista express grinder is crap i have had subjectively good result from mine and wondering if there is something i am missing,eh i think the barista express lie in a different category than these other machine since it ha a built in grinder the grinder on the barista express is pretty crappy anyway so i wa fine to see him review what is essentially a barista express without the waste of extra money on a crappy built in grinder,same i appreciate james covering a range of machine for all taste but the express is not much more expensive than the bambino while offering waaay better feature and build,please consider doing video s on best automatic espresso machine for the lazy crowd,for the sage machine which basket did you use i have been looking for a precision basket for the sage 54 mm portafilters and could not find a good match,i would some input on how to improve each machine i got the sage and i like it is foaming is superb but not using a grinder yet and using pressured basket hoe do i make my coffee a good a possible without upgrading basked and grinder my shot are still super fast even with a very fine and hard packed coffee is it mainly the basket fault what milk is good okej and not recommended for latte btw,thanks james,price difference seems to be huge in other country example switzerland gaggia 374 rancilio 960 in that case i think it clear who win the race,i had the dedica and had the same experience a you i moved to a flair and have not looked back,my first machine wa a lelit anna pid and i wa never able to get the texture right so in 3 month i upgraded to a profitec pro 800 and have been satisfied since,i would love for you to make a video on beginner friendly espresso machine and some tip and trix,love for you to look at prosumer model like rocket and ecm hx machine,without seeing the end my vote is on gaggia,can you please do a best grinder for espresso under gbpx,lelit bianca review,always fun to hear your input on machine,i have the bambino plus managed to get it for gbp199 on offer have no complaint about it it is a great entry level machine for the money and a you said full of feature,good review very concise,maybe a video about hx machine rocket izzo profitec 500 all with pid,i have a slightly more expensive full metal version of the delonghi and i love it granted i am not much of a coffee connoisseur it is saved me so much money from having to go into coffee shop in the long run never had to hold it down,james great review of each machine i have a gaggia and found the steam to be weak when i got it i would recommend turning the steam switch on and start steaming milk 20 25 second after doing so this way the boiler remains on the entire time you are steaming rather than waiting for the light to turn on before starting it work much better,whole latte love ha a video about this technique they turn it on 10 second before the light come on and get a huge boost i steam very small quantity of milk so i have not needed to try it,rancillo,james video idea i think my favorite brewing method is the moka pot it make such a wonderful cup of coffee i have used probable 30 different one but i have noticed there is a difference between using a big mocha pot and using a small mocha pot if you could compare and contrast the two that would be an excellent video in my humble opinion of course thanks and keep the video coming james,you can get silvia with pid edit right you said it in the end d i wonder how would you feel about the rocket r60 d,thanks for all your information i have acquired about coffee,what basket is he referring to that he chucked where can i get it,ive got a 2019 gaggia classic pro and it only got the one water tube not two anyone know why this is,so my little delonghi is a bit that is disappointing,robin hill touch,if you are happy with it then all is good enjoy the coffee i would love to replace my mazda with a porsche but i am still happy,something like three month ago i wa waiting for such review looking around etc i end up buying the lelit anita pl42emi i am quite happy with the machine a it is my first one into the adventure of barista it ha taught me a lot so far,they should all be tested a the manufacturer designed and built them,personally think it is fair to test them a enthusiast like u might use them,jganun i have used 4 out of those 5 the result would not of changed,doe anyone know the make and model of the scale that are used here,i removed the air incorporating attachment from the steamer on my delonghi and it went a long way to improving the milk texture that attachment is really frustrating if you want a bit more control over the milk,i have the sage breville barista express at home and i love it,now i need a video about where to get the money to buy an espresso machine,thank you for the comparison i own the lelit anna 2 model which come with a pid on top of the pressure gauge a regular steam wand and aviator switch for not much higher price ascaso sell in europe 57 mm precision competition basket i love my lelit,i would of liked to see the duo temp pro by sage i believe that is a better version of the bambino plus,this wa nice i love comparative test and it would be nice with a sage breville family test i know real connoisseur crinkle their nose over this brand but it ha an appeal to many user due to the design and after all decent performance and since they have so many machine at so many price point it would be nice with a comprehensive comparison,i owned a rancilio silvia for more than 10 year i am very happy with it and learned a lot it is true what james said about the temperature it is also pretty frstrating if you have guest you will have to wait for the temp to down to do the next capccino even if you surf the machine they you would still need to wait for the temp to go up for the milk if i were to buy a new one at this point i would surely go to the next level but there is no money to do that anyway,i would love you to do a video on the delonghi la specialista,great review you never see merchant doing review merchant do advertisement this wa a review there should be more like this for beginning coffee enthusiastics,wish i would seen this before buying the bambino which btw doe come with both pressurised basket and non pressurised basket,lovely video s but now we need one for 500 1000 and one for gt 1000 haha that would be a nice line up and a great buy guide,what about the cecotec power espresso 20 barista pro,that teaspoon set wa just beautiful,james i bought non pressurized basket 1 and 2 cup for my de longhi but i am struggling to put more than 14g of coffee in it how did you manage to fill it properly,i bought a robot cafelat best deal ever 0 maintenance lt 3,came here for the coffee machine now i am looking for some old fancy tea spoon,ok somebody tell me what bean to buy and where online i like black medium full bodied type of coffee i am sick of drinking nasty instant help a chap out,really not sure how you can compare a machine that cost gbp190 with one costing gbp520,i will bring a box of teaspoon at the next family lunch meet up thatll show em,spot on with the dedica had one for a couple of year a the kitchen in our old house wa tiny now i have the sage duo temp pro which turn out a decent cup did not want a machine with a grinder in a ive got a decent grinder i got mine in a sale at gbp250 which at that price point im happy with it,those rancilia amp gaggia would it be good for mini coffee shop like 20 100 cup a day,i will answer you a an amateur barista of course it could be done but you will soon suffer from stress since it is a single boiler machine you must wait 45 second after brewing the shot before you can steam milk to make another shot coffee you must cool down the boiler wait for the right temp again your guest will find the waiting time long i do not run a shop but even making coffee drink to 7 8 guest at home is annoying and you miss valuable time you could spend being a good host buy a pro heat exchange or double boiler machine for your coffee shop if that is too expensive buy a used one rancilio faema futurmat the brand doe not matter that much all the pro model are well made and you can find spare part,i am glad i do not know a great deal about coffee still a i have a dedica so i do not really know what i am missing it is got me intrigued now though,with each new video i am just the more grateful to the youtube algorithm for bringing me to your channel would love to hear more about the modding scene for these and other machine what mod make sense which to avoid etc,dear james for the bambino plus did you order a single walled basket from sage or did you use a different basket i am wondering because you are using vst basket for the gc and the silvia and i could not find vst or ims basket fitting the sage portafilter yet,could you make a more in depth video about modding i would like to get in to modding but could not find a whole lot out there,i just purchased the gaggia but i am not getting the best result with it i am using pre ground coffee illy and lavazza i am also using the filter basket that came with the machine the illy coffee i just had wa very bitter yuck i will keep watching your video and hopefully learn how to brew a good cup any suggestion would be very welcomed,i have got a silvia 5 it is my first machine and i like it but the more i use it the more i want to mod it i think i need a temperature gauge and pressure gauge but i do not know,if you were surprisingly impressed by the lelit i dare you to try the lelit bianca and flow profile with it,james you spoiled u with great production quality on all the other video the quality of sound on this one seems a lot worse thank you for a great review,absolutely spot on tried three of them and ended up torn between the same and finally got the gaggia and yes every aspect about it you have mentioned is correct and ended up modding it for pid and increase steam temp and pressure which now produce much much better espresso and texture milk very very well now to figure out the portafilter height,i am a huge fan and by no mean an expert i have an old gaggia and this specific delonghi i have them for 10 year i must say that the delonghi make better coffee for my taste my current bean are hausbrandt qualita rossa so they are exactly what you said would work well with it i maintain them very well the delonghi still make the same coffee it did 10 year ago but the gaggia started to degrade after 7 year i use high end ro filtration system the one that is connected to the delonghi wa replaced 3 year ago to the best one available where i live so it might be all connected just thought i share the delonghi seems to make better chocolate after taste from those bean i also get better extract from equivalent maro is 80 20 i keep recommending people this delonghi or just go higher in the price range for a good machine but where i live it is 10 time the price i am personally just do not see did not feel the reason to spend more on the gaggia having tried them both but i am not talking about this same gaggia a i have an old model,what about the automatic machine the one that take the bean and dispense latte at one press of a button,i have had a sage breville bambino plus for a couple of month now and use it daily i do wish there wa some kind of universal standard for coffee grinding a i use what is to me a fine grind grind setting 10 on the sage breville smart grinder pro to hear you say that you used a coarse grind make me wonder if there wa a bit of over extraction going on,very good if i wa spending gbp500 on a coffee machine i would put a little extra for a used commercial machine but i drink too much coffee,i think the render quality and audio bitrate is lower than usual on this video,if you are looking for the mod to help with all of the issue that james mention about the gaggia classic in this great review video such a 9 bar opv pressure mod and 6 5 bar and 5 bar pid temperature control to avoid temperature surfing and really address that weak standard steam slim drip tray to get larger cup under the portafilter bottomless pfs help with this too slim deep drip tray to help with putting scale on the drip tray and a few other thing including a new on off switch to address that annoying eu uk rocker switch and the 20min timer head over to the home of gaggia classic modding at shade of coffee,this is all becoming very technical and expensive is there a machine that make a really good coffee at a reasonable price i am going to have a cup of tea whilst i research a bit more,otherwise sage to start and ecm if you have more money,choose one that is in your budget you can always buy a more expensive one later i personally would not bother with all the mod like adding pid spend money on good coffee,shout out to raj here here,i see the rancilio ha not changed it design in the 14 year since i had one,how do you find the right setting with a volumetric machine,great video james a always i wonder if you can go finer with the bambino by decreasing the dose to compensate would that potentially work with the light roast,david hassellhoff better watch out james is our favourite hoff man,very nice round up and a good and fair comparison i have had the lelit for about 4 year now it is my first espresso machine and i have enjoyed using it thanks to your video i have definitely stepped up my game over the last year or so and i can make pretty good espresso with it but i also recognize it is flaw i also do not like the water tank and drip tray and i find the non standard size of the portafilter to be slightly frustrating a it is harder to find accessory for it but all in all i think it is a good value for money and a nice machine to start learning how to make proper espresso,delonghi owner for 1 5 year opinion i think the delonghi is worth the money and what it delivers think of your average consumption per day and now justify it with the price of the machine if you are like me drinking 2 3 doulbe espresso a day then your price point is around that machine or let say around 400euros prosumers or hobby baristas usually buy machine above 1000euros because a you said the machine between 500 1000 require tinkering expansion and awkward installment in order to bring maybe the result you are expecting now question yourself to what you are comparing this awkward price category 500 1000 ist just inconvenient imho,let is go team silvia,keep in mind james hoffman is having decent result in these machine cause he ha one of the best grinder under dollar1k the niche zero grinder first,luckydragon yes grind can definitely affect the taste however it is possible to get great taste from fine espresso grind without spending a lot of dollardollar on a machine i use a dollar25 hand grinder with ceramic conical burr consistent powder fine grind even good enough for turkish brew made tasty espresso disadvantage is it take longer to grind and in the morning it could be a chore,irvingg71 pretty much,sophia holmes yah you will never make espresso in your life with a blade grinder their methodology a people mentioned is pretty bad and amongst the enthusiast it is just a joke if your coffee is from the grocery store then yah it kind of doe not matter,sophia holmes atk is not a good source of knowledge for coffee espresso enthusiast if you can not afford a good burr grinder e g your only option are pre ground or a blade grinder you are better off making espresso in a moka pot people pay hundred or thousand for a good grinder not because they are easier to use or clean but because they provide superior grind consistency and precise adjustment of particle size feature that are essential to being able to make good espresso,sophia holmes i have read the article you are talking about on the america is test kitchen test their methodology wa not great and their good burr grinder were actually quite poor i assure you you can taste the difference between a baratza encore one of the grinder recommended in that test and jame is niche zero you will struggle to dial in espresso at all with an encore or something in it class i know a i have owned one,hi james thanks for this great video i have a rancillo and wa interested why you changed out the basket and what benefit that ha also i love my racillio have had it for 6 year,please review la marzocco linea mini,i have the classic pro paired with grinta grinder and love it waiting for pid kit to come in,this what i am waiting thank you,please do a modding video for one of them lovely video once again thank you,thanks j awesome,owning the silvia you are spot on great for milk and will make great espresso for the effort my gripe is the drawn out cooling flush required after steaming making it very difficult to make back to back milk drink instead of investing in a pid i think i will save up to get a hx to steam and brew at the same time fortunately they hold their value superbly,the silvia wa on my radar for the home a few year ago but i knew it would require some modding and i came to the conclusion that when all is said and done a little more money would buy me an e61 machine with pid and even better build that did not require extra tinkering i ended up with the bezzera unica no regret,james or anyone know where to get vst basket for a 54mm basket i have a 54mm breville,the bambino here in new zealand is breville rather than sage and only come with the dual wall pressurised basket unless you want to buy pre ground coffee you should 100percent get standard basket here you can buy them directly from breville for approx dollar12 other than the machine being so light and moving around when locking in the portafilter i have loved using it it wa my first espresso machine so i have learned a lot with it but once i ha the standard basket decent bean and got the hang of dialling my shot i wa very impressed with the coffee i could get from it a james said it wa a good machine to learn manual steaming on but the automatic steaming also make it easy enough for visitor to use my young niece love making their own hot chocolate like the one at the cafe another bonus is how quickly it is ready to go literally second and thr water is up to temp unfortunately my bambino died a couple of month ago after having it for le than 1 year due to a disagreement between the service agent and the ship from where i bought it basically over 6 week since it went to them for repair and it had not been touched i got a full refund they had none in stock to replace it and doe not look like they are getting more in any time a their system said the line is finished i have found a couple of chain store still selling them online but they also no longer have them in store i am currently torn whether to get another one or go for something like the sylvia but that is twice the price of the bambino here dollar1300 to dollar1500 v dollar580 to dollar750 respectively which put the breville the infuser in between them in price but closer to the bambino however it look like you then lose the automatic milk frothing while keeping the pre infusion with the infuser but the le then great look or build quality that you get with thre sylvia,i have been pleasantly surprised by my bambino make my morning coffee quick and hassle free i bought it on half price special offer which made it a bargain and gave me more to spend on a decent grinder it only came with pressurised basket but a quick email to sage and they sent me two standard basket free of charge,i bought the rancilio before finding this channel happy to know that i have made the right choice,i only drink a handful of cup of coffee in a week but i still watch all these video i just love the attention too detail love and integrity that is put into them and come out beautiful and inspiring,really,not sure why you chose the sage bambino over the sage barista express in the under gbp500 category whilst the regular price is gbp549 it is always available at gbp500 or le it is far superior to the bambino and would have been a better and fairer match against the gaggia and the rancilio you seemed to allow the rancilio in at gbp529 on the basis that it can be bought for under gbp500 so why not the barista express,important to note with the silvia is that the unstable boiler temperature also effect the milk steaming in my experience you basically have to start steaming milk immediately after the light switch off to get that powerful steaming however if you wait just a 30 second 1 minute it get considerably weaker and you have to steam for a lot longer,if i got this right hoffmann doe not like pressurized basket,c m graef cm800 is a reasonable priced burr grinder which grind nice enough for espresso hard to set up noisy and messy though but great when you are on a budget,what about dual boiler kitchenaid artisan with gaggia inside,i wa impressed by how easily he popped out the one from the bambino i have the same breville u version and i need a knife to get the basket out i am probably doing this wrong though,john saxon one compromise i made wa to go for a manual grinder i found a cheap bialetti one that grind fine enough for espresso the downside is taking about 5 min to grind enough for 1 double shot,no professional barista will use pressurised basket but for u noobs it is the best if i use pressurised basket grind setting doe not matter much and i get crema too but with non p it is very difficult to get the grind size right specially when you do not have a good grinder,i have the gaggia classic and i have been dealing with some unstable result both in milk steaming and shot pulling i think modding after the warranty period is over is very interesting that said i am very pleased with it and i drink a lot of espresso and after some hundred shot you kind of get to know the machine and it is twist and turn if you are considering this one i do not think you will end up disappointed,very nice and informative only thing i would have included is going into some used machine i suspect finding some great value there,i have used both a breville bambino plus and the gaggia classic pro i wa frustrated with the breville when it came to pulling shot much better result from the gaggia i am still working on consistency with the gaggia also the breville had it heater go out way to soon if it had been a better machine i would have sent it back to breville to be repaired but with the way it ran i chose to replace it instead the steaming though wa nice,399 for sage bambino plus seems steep i paid 229 at curry is only a few month back end feb,the lelit ana pl42tem with a pid wa around 450gbp brand new for me and it is one of the best entry level machine i have ever used with an ascaso basket the amount of control you have is really astonishing for the money decent modding temp control easy pressure control,i love these type of video can we get a comparison of a linea mini a gs3 and a lelit bianca v2,i had a used gaggia but soon after i got it there were floating piece coming out of the boiler it made nice coffee though then i bought a new lelit still use now and get a good cup out of it not a great cup though,hi i unfortunately have the delonghi coffee machine you have used what exactly did you buy to change the basket,amazon ha single wall basket and filter that fit the temp can be raised a well,i have a sylvia with pid mod this show how grossly unstable the temperature is learning to dance with the sylvia is a challenge that can be rewarding and certainly is educational it is priced for entry level consumer who paradoxically are seldom temperamentally equipped for the journey,the delonghi drip tray look a bit shocked,what doe he do with all these machine when he is done,which basked did you use for the sage breville i have been wanting to upgrade my barista express and have had no luck finding 54mm basket,what basket did you use for the bambino i need to upgrade mine,the title of this video should be my favourite machine under gbp500 because i am still none the wiser what the best machine is it feel like you are saying that for thr majority of people it is the sage breville,i might be a little biased because i am a lelit 41lem owner also i can not speak for the others but i have something to add there is important info missing from this comparison like machine internals i know lelit is boiler is brass 250ml gaggia is aluminum 100ml huge plus for lelit do not know others lelit ha a pid version in the gbp400 range 41tem the version 41em in this comparison is the most cheap in anna line tem and lem have nicer button and i think a better steam wand tem ha pid lem ha the water plastic tray hidden there is ims and ascaso basket for lelit 57mm most people say ascaso is the better i have only ims anyway lelit is pretty good value i paid gbp282 two year ago for 41lem with some discount black friday local coffee comunity,regarding the basic delonghi modification i also upgraded my first espresso machine an entry level delonghi with a non pressurized basket instead of the standard pressurized standard item and i had to remove that same plastic insert but after a number of messy shot my penny dropped you can just insert a stainless steel screw into the superfluous screw hole no more mess but i would pick my cafelat robot and a cafeti re for the occasional plant based milk frothing over any of these machine any day,i have got an older gaggia classic at home fully agree with the relevant comment about temperature drifting but easy to mod and excellent build quality limited headroom between portafilter and tray,very good review when you said i have upgraded my spoon i wa like what,i have a slightly urgent question so if you have a chance to get back quickly or if anyone else on here ha an opinion on this please get back to me asap which would you recommend between the breville barista pro the breville barista touch or one of these shown in this video hope to hear back from you guy soon thx for the advice anyone,i saw this today in the time i wa hoping to see some of your coffee and wondered about your thought on the winner,a a newbie who bought a silvia never having used an espresso machine before the comment about making a mess a whole bunch of time gave me vietnam flashback also the temp surfing thing is a bit annoying at first but to me it is like driving stick after a while you kind of do not even notice you are doing it,8 11 i love you for this d,awesome review i have been using a gran gaggia style machine very cheap machine seems to be be doing an okay job although i have been thinking of upgrading not sure what machine you would recommend,you reminded me just how much i would love to have an espresso machine and also just how much i do not want to have an espresso machine great review,i wa interested in the dedica because of it very small footprint counter space at home is at a very high premium and pretty budget price but a usual with everything else where i live it is got a 30percent markup for no reason guess that is a pas from me,wish you did this video 2 month ago my partner and i were debating between rancilio and the gaggia and watched countlesssss review we ended up buying the gaggia for the price point to start our espresso hobby journey the portafilter weight distribution and the machine weight were the first thing i noticed too but we are happy with our beginner purchase i like espresso with milk and my partner enjoys just espresso so it worked out for u,i once bought a pair of spoon with cat head on them and little paw to keep them fixed to the edge of the cup did not realise they were coffee spoon so they are too small for any other use and for some reason the fancy spoon because i am a fancy man bit sorta reminded me of them,a a new rancilio owner hobbyist barista lockdown gt melbourne silvia not going crazy i am grateful for the reassurance that learning to steam milk on the beast is not easy have been terrified of it is steam power though soldiering on with chris baca is voice in my head yelling crank it i my silvia and rok gc grinder so very much i give it a little pat each time i use it it is an enormous source of joy thank you very very much for this video and will isee you at the cupping,wow i have the delonghi can you tell me what basket you use,is it me or the audio is a lil echoey still a very good video nonetheless keep up the good work,great review love watching amp ur love for exceptional coffee i know it mostly about pulling a good shot but usability is always a factor too it would have been interesting to know how long it take for the unit to get to a useable temprature,i totally agree with the frustration of temperature surfing wether it is a kettle for a pour over or an espresso machine having an understanding of where you are at is so valuable,watched this with interest a it ha the one i own and the one i wa considering upgrading to i purchased a dedica 680 about year ago slightly used for dollar100 this wa an experiment to see if i could save some money because my wife love her vanilla latte with almond milk iced at dollar5 to purchase those she could make a quad shot and be done at a fraction of the cost it work quite well for her she is not a snob just want to push a couple of button and have it happen for her yes it is only a 51mm portafilter which is frustrating the temperature is adjustable i tend to use darker roasted bean i have experimented with the 3 setting and found the one that work for me i have a decent grinder but not sure it would cut it with an unpressurized machine but it is what i have had and it work great for making regular coffee from either my technivorm or breville precision brewer i like taking something that will last me a while at work i do make latte with the dedica but learned early on to take off the panarello wand portion and just use the rubber portion it make it shorter so it is sometimes hard with certain pitcher getting it low enough but i can get decent milk texture from it now creating latte art that is the fault of the artist for dollar100 money well spent a an experiment my worry is that the unit i wa hoping to purchase the gaggia classic pro seemed to have some issue a well i understand modding an inexpensive machine like the dedica but it seems that the piece that you talk about modding not including a pid should be done right the first time at the factory for no increase in cost i do like it that it doe come with a pressurized basket so i have a backup plan if my grinder doe not grind fine enough and can start setting aside some fund to upgrade so even though my unit did not make out great i am still happy with the experiment and do not have that much invested in it so that there is room for modding thanks for the review a always,i picked up a bottomless portafilter from walmart cost me a little over dollar50cad it is best thing i have done to my dedica and the easiest to reverse lol came with a cheap non pressurized basket you can always order a precision basket later if you want or pop your stock pressurized basket in when you are lazy or if your grinder doe not do the job i prefer the extra room with the bottomless and it look so much better also make sure you bump your brew temp up if you have not already way better espresso that way instruction to do so are in the manual,thanks henry i have had one for a few month and am trying to get the best out of it have ordered a tamper distributor a non pressurised basket and scale i enjoy experimenting so i am looking forward to seeing what i can get from it before upgrading if i feel it is worth it for me,been waiting for this your review are objective well balanced and super useful,,let is not mess around eagle one prima v linea mini v rocket r nine one v g 3 v ecm synchronika,this,i wa considering getting the rancilio when i discovered that our local nuova simonelli distributor had the oscar ii with the so called pro pak pump bypass sirai presostat for not much more and that is what i ended up with a a regular milk drinker i could not be more satisfied with this small hx thank you for your magnificent channel james,how do you get such good latte art from inexpensive machine ive always blamed my steam wand but clearly the issue is me is it the milk do i need whole milk what is your secret it is the milk is not it not me right,thank you just what i wa looking for,i own a gaggia classic because this video wa not out when i went shipping for an espresso machine at that price point glad to see i made a good choice i am really into modding all sort of stuff but did not even think of modding my espresso machine thanks for the head up regarding your comment on the steam wand i am no expert but i can feel that texturing the milk with air i would like more pressure,i went through a number of cheaper machine including that de longhi when i wa pushed for space before doing thing properly and buying a rocket i only occasionally do milk though so never got annoyed with the plastic bit on the wand which iirc just pull off,i am a fancy man are not we all haha great review learned a lot,enjoying these video so far still waiting for a take on the sage barista express i am looking at you patreons,would you please make a video for new rancilio silvia pro,forgive me if this a stupid question but did you set the dedica for high temp can you provide a link to the replacement basket,will those fancy spoon with it fancy case be available in your merch soon,probably could do a category in between 100 and 500 pound maybe up to 250 not sure if you can get sunbeam over there but the mini barista would likely smash the delonghi,just curious why is the bambino and barista always used for comparison on these coffee channel but never the duo temp seems like the duo temp would fit the budget and ha more control feature than the bambino i have been enjoying mine is it because they do not push it in b amp m store,hi james thank you for the review have you heard anything about the soon to be released silvia pro by rancilio i believe it ha a thermometer and may fall into the next price range keep making video,i got the rancilio a few year ago i chose it because it look like it ha not been changed in year which is a good indicator of long term support and longevity in general i just want to say thank you for talking about it is drawback i have noticed some brew do not come out a well and i am definitely going to try the temp purge thing before pulling my shot also now i am thinking about a new basket for it pretty sure 1200 comment in no one is going to be reading this but just in case thanks,i live in brooklyn new york and i heard there is a local company that made a new home espresso machine and i have not found a lot of reviewer content on it a it is pretty new and may not have a ton of marketing behind it if you could get your hand on it mind giving it a review it ha a very contemporary design compared to the usual espresso machine design,could you do a best grinder that can grind for espresso and brewed coffee,very good selection,i do not like any of them i like the manual flair a the quality of everything i use is excellent and being manual one ha the ability to learn and be in control at a very high degree along with my manual kinu m47 grinder i also have quality and control i use a porcelain container to heat the water which is another quality material expensive machine with shortcoming are of no interest to me,enjoyed that i have the rancillo silva myself and when i got it at first i ruined more coffee than i thought possible there is a bit of a learning curve with it and figuring out it is foible i wa coming from a cheap delonghi and with that i used to steam my milk then pull my espresso but when i did that with the silva the espresso wa burnt most of the time being a single boiler it get very hot on the steam setting and take a while to cool back down so i had to reverse the process pull a shot then switch to steam it also took a long time to dial in the grind size it wa far more unforgiving than the delonghi too fine and it squeeze out undrinkable tar and too coarse and you get watery blegh but not i have all those thing figured out i am getting very good tasty and consistent shot and smooth and velvet milk in my flat white the steam wand is definitely the star of the show it froth milk so much better than any other consumer level machine i have ever used and for that it wa worth the time spent getting used to it,ah shame you could not check out the breville sage infuser instead it more of a direct competitor to the gaggia classic having a pressure gauge 3 way solenoid valve and traditional steam wand,had a dedica it ha 3 water temp i found you had to go to the hottest setting the medium default temp is too cool also the best steaming is by removing the panarello wand and using the rubber inner single hole tube hold it on with a plastic tie wrap or it will blow off in your milk you can play with the timing of the steam switch but i got pretty good milk texture that way in fact this wa how i learned to steam milk the panarello wa not useful when i had this model i did not have a great hand grinder and i would easily choke the machine which created quite a mess i ended up having to remove a screw to take off the screen and clean the coffee grind i cursed this unit and only kept it about 3 month before upgrading today a pid should not be an expensive addition option although the silvia pro with pid is dollar2200 here in canada much too expensive,great video fun and informative thank you,great start to the day now to make some coffee,much love from indonesia,hello mr hoffman i really love your video and the one you did on the niche zero wa what sealed the deal for me to purchase one i am now in the market to upgrade my espresso machine and want to go with the lelit mara x do you think this is a good match for the niche,i just got the gaggia classic and i am pretty satisfied i do agree that the temp and pressure are off but it doe suffice for my little apartment i got right now i do have to tilt my pitcher at a much more extreme angle to get a good roll,only thirty second in and the only two i would ever consider based on aesthetic alone would be the delonghi and the sage those other hideous machine whatever quality they may posse would never find their way into my kitchen now for the rest of the video in order to discover just what exactly is going here cheer edit ok 8 10 that is what i came for james never disappoints lol bos edit 2 now that i have watched this in it entirety life choice confirmed 1 do not try to make espresso at home 2 do make the effort to get to my local coffee shop where it is done right,i have the sage breville bambino be interested to switch out the basket been looking for so long great machine and described perfectly i get into other brewing method more seriously but for pre work flat white long black the bambino doe great with little effort,i have the gaggia classic pro and really like you said the only problem i have had is just the temperature surfing,we have recently acquired the smeg espresso machine and burr grinder i am super excited with them i think they are amazing but i am new to the home espresso game i got both for about 750 dollar u total well worth the price of admission a far a i am concerned the grinder is incredible my first real grinder love it work great for fine in the espresso and so easy to switch to something more coarse like for our chemex thank you so much mr hoffman for encouraging me to dabble in the home coffee world i certainly enjoy making a double shot of espresso then steaming some irish cream for an evening latte,remember that comment about james being the david attenborough of coffee yeah that comment nailed it i 100percent trust james opinion and he make the geekyness of coffee so digestible,you should do a video on coffee grinder too,all these machine made in china,i am confused from what you told during tasting and testing it seemed like the lelit would come out on top and the rancilio and gaggia not so much i also kinda miss the point about the pressure valve of the lelit how doe it help me,when i watch these kind of review it make my old sunbeam em6910 cafe series look like a rock star i feel that the sunbeam cafe series is heavily underrated they are built so well and last year been hammering machine since 2009 have you got sunbeam in the uk can you review the new version i have been considering upgrading to the sunbeam torino machine it is a stunning looking machine,okay james killer video now it is time to do best machine under dollar2000 plzzzz,so i have the de longhi ecp3420 i know about my basket issue and have known for a while i can remove the plastic piece inside my current portafilter but because the basket is 51mm i find it very difficult to find the right basket especially a vst one im probably just going to get a bottomless portafilter anyway but how or where do i find a good basket to fit a 51mm,i have had my second hand mid 2000 is classic for a little le than a year now and i love it the mod community is fantastic i have only really done the steam wand and blind opv the steaming power doe vary a bit in my opinion and doe take getting to know the machine a bit if you learn about how long it take to heat up and you can start steaming before the light turn on the heating element stay on and you get quite a bit more power,your accent is delicious the sound of your t is like biting into a juicy pear or an apple fancy a your teaspoon without any hint of annoying snobby poshness i am in love,i am looking for the next price category up personally but this wa a great rundown thanks,my only experience ha been with the rancilio i think temp have been my issue a well i noticed you want to be sure to give it the right time in between shot while also being sure to dispel some water before pulling since it may have too hot of water at the beginning i also had some weird experience where one minute the grind wa dialed in and the next the water would flow so fast that it wa almost a if there wa no coffee in the basket i attribute this to experimenting with the machine a while and not owning it for a long duration of time really i just mooched off my uncle when he got it hehe i actually enjoy using my flair pro more but the coffee from the rancilio wa super good,bought a gaggia classic pro a few week ago but have not yet bought a grinder so i am just using pre ground coffee in the pressurized filter basket i am so sorry james,the gaggia and sylvia are absolute tank and can last indefinitely if serviced and treated well if you are going for budget i recommend buying used so that you can use the extra money on a good grinder,how do i put my name in for a give away i have been dying for a rancilio silvia for year,vst basket can someone help me on what this is a url perhaps,cristina joaquino ahhh yes thank you,would like to see ecm casa v included in the video for comparison,i have a silvia with a pid and really like it would love to see you test one out still playing with the temperature to find the exact sweet spot but 218 at the boiler is where i am getting good result now,honestly think james would be horrified by my beko machine but hey it make coffee and i like it i would be super curious to see him do a compact coffee machine comparison they tend to be cheaper and worse quality but i wonder if there is any good one out there,i got sage bambino back in march at curry uk for gbp220 think it wa on the promo it surprisingly came with two set of basket pressurised double walled and standard for both single and double frankly i love the espresso from it i thought that automated milk will be a gimmick but it actually doe a great job only issue i have that the milk temperature is not consistent sometimes it overheats the milk in lowest setting though it may be due to wet probe that sits under the milk jug overall i really think that i get better coffee than in majority of cafe and definitely better that in 98percent of chain coffee shop there wa this one barista at costa who really knew her stuff about coffee since she left most of my great coffee is at home,i have often seen silvia upgraded with a pid controller,john saxon it is also a double boiler with insulation better steam wand and a shot timer which make it a new product in the range of other product such a the profitec pro 300 for example not just a pid,b hartmann yes and they now make one with a pid but decided that they should nearly double the price,all those machine i just need one thanks for sharing love the video,a lot of people add pid on these machine can you do a comparison if a pid wa added,thanks for the great comparison can you do one for under 2000gbp i think it would be a very interesting price segment,la pavoni,i guess they were not paying,i really enjoyed your review but i wish i could afford gaggia or rancilio they both are seems decent for me living in turkey is like it just let you to watch them not to buy them because of the power of turkish lira it make me so sad just wanted to share my thought,1 for happy sage bambino owner for future buyer there are often offering them discounted for 300 i bought mine for that euro and the value for money is quite amazing it doe produce reliably good espresso in the morning medium roast lover here and my girlfriend love the auto milk frothing while i can practice my skill manually it just feel like they really tried to make a non frustrating experience for people who want to have a good coffee but with extra feature for u who like to play around a bit for me it is definitely the best bang for the buck especially if you get it for 300 it is compact fit my scale even with alarge cup heat up incredibly quickly and just doe the job made me enjoy the first coffee in the morning a lot more p agree with the negative drip tray a bit too small steam wand can make a little mess cause of that too little heft would be nice too also the water filter feature is nice but since they have changed it they are sage exclusive type with no unbranded alternative and pretty pricy,would the sage duo temp pro not have addressed the shortcoming of the others with solid build quality steam wand and built in pid at a competitive price of gbp379,the red one is not a nespresso machine,great video a usual but i think u should have put some montage or some transition between the review of each machine,this price range is so frustrating and you have nailed exactly why a i expected i wa all set to get the gaggia which is about 300 pound here in au but would have had to void the warranty to get 9 bar and could not fit a latte glass under the gh with scale silvia is over 500 here usually and it drip tray tank are annoying i am someone who really like to know water level for the reason you identify hard to believe that is not a priority for rancilio user oh and no pid on either make for a lot of guesswork until you are veeeery familiar with the machine lelit anna with optional pid wa front runner for a while but again tank and tray did not do it ot for me if it is in a corner with steam knob facing out you can not see the water level bambino result quite good but feel overly light probably could have lived with this compromise but the dual boiler is now available here for around the 400 pound mark and it really feel worth the extra 58mm portafilter pid for grouphead boiler steam boiler mean very predictable result just need to have more bench counter space tl dr recommend bdb if you can get it in this price range would have been tough to survive this melbourne lockdown without it,karl billeter yep steam is slow ish but very steady like james description of the bambino is forgot to mention the drip tray is huge and very well designed,we had a saeco via venezia for around 6 year and abused it pretty heavily very simple mod of naked porter filter and breville steam wand sound similar to the gaggia in handling the 51mm basket wa a pain we are pretty lucky to get it for dollar270aud but it died during first melbourne lockdown even luckier when my mother in law sent u a breville dual boiler a a replacement really enjoying it the steam doe feel a touch restrained but mile ahead of the saeco that just ran out very small boiler,and now you do this when i bought a machine just last week d,thank you i have been doing some research now i know a little more thanks,thanks james i think the other thing to consider is longevity the silvia and the gaggia are repairable you can open them up to figure out what is going on and you can get part and mod the design have not changed much over time i have friend with 10 year old silvia running strong i think the others will be landfill in two year,i am really surprised by your review of the gaggia i have been watching alot of american review and the youtube coffee channel just love the gaggia your the first youtuber to cast doubt on it for me,james is really picky though he work with machine priced 15k so a 400 one will definitely have it issue,great review a always while i like to tinker but when i am half asleep in the morning i do not want to think too much that said this video validates that sage breville make the best feature rich well designed home machine or a daily driver,12 09 uhhh daddy,rancilio silvia owner here and big fan of it do not mind the temperature surfing too much a i have quickly developed a routine that work well plenty of user video on youtube to follow a a guide,what happened to the editing this is unwatchable no pause let me breathe i came there to hear you tell a story the thing you to so well but this editing get in the way,by halfway through i thought this dude is so keyed up on espresso he is throwin filter out the window,well wonder how your decision would have been if you would have included sage appliance barista express which can often be found for under gbp500 a well,having a quickmill orione 3000 silvia ballpark but thermoblock with a pressure valve 30euros and some basket from lamarzocco 20euros i love the improvement over the default biggest question how to use pressure the right way my niche is used for 14g in 32g in 24 out at 12 with 10bar when i see your niche setting i wonder if i miss sth obvious here in hamburg,great revieuw i use the same silvia for a year now and once you know the habit of the machine it easy to use when steaming milk you often will get a tsunami and milk will go everywhere just firstly pop the thing on and let the lil amount of high pres water out then go steaming milk thinking of getting a pid on it tho also unf the machine get rust here and there very fast,also on dedica one can choose three temperature setting for lighter and darker roast,for people is info in the uk that bambino plus wa retailing at gbp200 before covid sick really is not it,lloyd cw hey i too have a dedica i found certain improvement help make a real pro coffee for little expense i bought a rancilio rocky grinder then i bought some non pressurized filter basket from ebay for gbp10 can fit in your original portafilter just have to take the little plastic part out at the bottom and cut it down by about half a cm this way the new basket will fit in by doing this you can make expert coffee with a nice fine grind from a decent grinder alternatively to save that messing about you can buy a naked portafilter which is also non pressurized from ebay for about gbp30 very easy to find this stuff online and get a nice cheap upgrade for your machine,if you search for with costco they were selling it for gbp229 i want this machine a we mostly drink latte and flat white and not someone who want to spend crazy money and go down the rabbit whole for mainly milky drink this wil replace our dedica which ha server u well but now a bit noiseyer and not a consistent plus a pain to not clog it up with superfine coffee a it can not deal with actual espresso ground coffee hope the sage come back down to a reasonable price,we have the rancilio at home and i am quite happy with the espresso i get from it i might get a new basket for it after this video d i also need to translate this video for my dad a he is the one who us it most often i am at uni out of town most of the time and i am sure he would love to learn more,how can you not have the breville sage barista express on here,a quick google search say the barista express is slightly over the gbp500 budget but i agree i wish james would properly review it have not seen that many sage review on his channel,i bought a used silvia in good shape a couple of year ago and recently added a pid just recently opened up the machine and tweaked the brew pressure a bit because it wa a bit high from the factory around 11 12 bar lowered it to 8 and my shot are incredibly nice and sweet now i love that it ha such potential to get invested in it and improve it to something that will rival a machine that is 3x a expensive it will be difficult for me to find a reason to upgrade but all this talk of vst basket make me curious of the difference it would make,i have the breville sage duo temp pro for the wife and the flair signature pro for me my understanding wa the dtp wa equivalent to the bambino except in footprint it doe have some extra milk feature however one day we will just have the decent for both of u,sage barista express this can also be often bought on sale for le than gbp500,would love to see how you get on with 15g in the dedica have managed to get much better espresso with that amount,i do believe we need to see a live stream of james modding a coffee machine,ahahahahah,which one is best equiped for hot water for americanos,best for brewathome thanks for this review it is a low price range but you can get decent espresso which is super satisfying,i have the bambino the 3 second warm up wa a big selling point and not having to learn too much about coffee and latte art to get good result i would like to know where to get a 54mm basket to change out the pressurised stock basket i also have the sage grinder and would love to dial that in more precisely thanks a always,i recently bought a lelit anna after ton of research so it wa really interesting hearing your opinion on it i got a slightly upgraded model that ha a pid so it is nice to know the exact temperature i almost bought a gaggia classic and strongly considered a rancilio silvia used but what sold me on the anna wa the pid and pressure gauge it is also the nicest looking imo3 i agree that i wish it had more steaming power overall i am really happy with the lelit a someone who is just getting into the world of espresso making,love mine,absolutely spot on entry level recommendation imo all of these machine are only a good a the grinder used with it at this level it pretty much a 1 1 spend on espresso machine to a decent enough grinder so i expect an espresso grinder group review video next in this series,long awaited thank you enjoy all of your video,with lelit is portafilter being 57mm would niche dosing cup still fit into it i have got lelit espresso machine a a wedding gift and hoping to get niche zero to complete the setup thanks a lot,really nice video content here but the editing wa really confusing at time some transition would help i think,thanks great work but one thing i would like to know too is which one make le noise i just can not stand noise early in the morning wich is one of the main reason i own a lever pavoni still though very nice job,had the dedica for about a year and became frustrated with it limitation bought the silvia about 6 month ago and love it i have been considering the pid mod for a while glad to hear it is worth it,i have the old classic pullman basket made a great improvement to the espresso i do not use the plastic steamer attachment the naked wand add a baratza sette 270 and your in heaven,i own the new gaggia classic the model in europe is called new gaggia classic and in usa is called gaggi classic pro and the milk steaming tends to be frustrating at time it start with a good spin and then seems like it loos power for steaming and sometimes the milk texture is not a foamy and silky a it should be maybe i need a pid for the machine,author where is your similar like nit pick a you did for aldi coffee maker no i am not a user of it,i got the lelit without a pressure gauge for around 250euros a few year ago a my first espresso machine and i am still using and enjoying it it is a really good value for the low price,when james call out a medium dark or light roast doe anyone else wish he would use cinnamon city full city terminology at the same time some people call city medium but some call it light it get tricky in a video like this when a machine can not handle light roast edit i realized i should not just leave a note like that and be an as especially when i look forward to these new video so much james you do not a fantastic job and i love hearing your thought on anything coffee related so a little constructive criticism and a bunch of credit where credit it due,to get excellent steam power on gaggia classic you just have to practice a little temperature surfing i have the original gaggia classic and this is how you do it start steaming before the boiler reach max pressure before light indicator tell you it ha reached the correct pressure which use to take around 30 second after you press the button so start steaming at around 20 25 second and the machine will build pressure during the whole steaming process it work very well,really nice video like always something wrong with the sound though not the soundquality i am used to watching your video,thanks for the review james been enjoying your channel lot of good knowledge about coffee i bought the gaggia classic pro a few week ago enjoyed the shot pulling for about a week before returning it because the group head paint or whatever the chrome wa wa peeling off and got into the coffee i think rancilio had the same problem so now they offer the black plastic instead quite disappointing,make sure you are cleaning regularly clogging is a known issue of all electrical coffee maker just use vinegar to clean it,exactly the video i always wanted to see thank you,author of this video what sort and make of the coffee you are using to test this device and grinding level and water quality would be nice to know aswell,thanks james have the bambino love the machine a my first espresso machine substantially cheaper than the silvia in australia 1 3 so no brainer for me the machine taught me so much and make me want to upgrade i do full manual and learnt milk texturing with it got unpressurised basket from the beginning and still need to learn more on the espresso side,it seems like there should be better machine for this price,i hope you can test the atomic espresso maker,finally i have been waiting for this video forever thank you and i hope you have a good day,spent age modifying my la pavoni to produce perfect espresso but surprisingly found myself using v60 everyday now em why,what is the advantage of a better basket will it really make a difference i use a breville sage dual boiler,your summary and market analysis for the sage bambino completely resonated with me i can make to my taste a perfectly good milky espresso drink without having to worry too much about what i am doing or how i am doing it it is largely effortless apart from a little work dialing in the grind when changing bean and i am happy with the result if i want to learn how to do more with the milk i can learn a i go or i can just leave it on the sensor while i make a packed lunch for my kid easy mode good result,i have been trying to find a 51mm basket for my dedica should i just grab the 9 99 one on amazon review seem surprisingly positive or is there better product i can pickup somewhere else same question for the tamper update i got the delonghi tamper and this basket they work great with my dedica,would be great to get some information on modding,startup time on the sage is phenomenal make a big difference if you do not have age to prepare a cup,hey thought on the new silvia pro w factory installed pid i own a silvia w an aftermarket pid by seattle coffee gear and am very happy with all but the tank and drip tray of this machine and it feel like it will last forver,for the dedica the whole drip tray is removable and allows for depper cup it ha i more shallow drip tray under it,great video a always i really enjoyed your thought on these machine a someone who is had a bambino for 1 5 year i think you have missed a trick here by using the same recipe for all machine regardless of the portafilter size if you use the same mass of coffee in the basket then a narrower portafilter will result in a thicker puck to hit your extraction time you will have to use a coarser grind and so you will suffer from under extraction if you adjust the mass you use so that your puck is not thicker for 54mm you would want to use 87percent of the coffee you use in a 58mm portafilter you should also adjust time and expected espresso out a well but you will get a better end result for it,loved the video a always i am looking to upgrade from this category of machine to a rocket apartamento james could you do a video about machine with a dollar1 5 2k price range,we just got the full auto gaggia brera a week or so ago a we never had espresso frequently enough to bother with a semi automatic we just replaced our old brevelle it is been so nice to get consistent shot without the hassle even though i know i could make them better on a semi auto,i own the bambino plus and i am surprised you did not get the whole set of basket for the portafilter mine came with the whole double and single one a part of the package 2 off also mine is the metal chrome one not the black plastic and it certainly doe not look cheap yes it doe lack a bit of mass but the portafilte feel really solid one thing that is massively better than all the other you demoed is that the bambino come with a built in water filter fitted in the tank and that you can take the tank off sideways if it is under a kitchen cabinet i will not go about the fact it also ha a pid and various bit because i am actually not completely lost in expresso making at this point but to me given the size of the package and the feature it get from it i find it really good in a really small footprint i do feel i can get into getting more anal about the whole process with this machine before i feel i am outgrowing it,great review james 15 year rancilio silvia owner same machine that i have modded over the year adding the better stream wand and pid temperature control replaced the boiler last year and it is running strong again built strong relatively easy to mod repair and it make delightful espresso and steam milk really well for milk based drink,looking for positive comment on dedica to make myself feel good about my purchase which did not seem cheap when i bought it p just bought the mentioned portafilter non pressurized basket and some accessory from aliexpress,seems ridiculous the manufacture of these machine would not do the small modification you recommend themselves can not believe you would spend gbp500 and then void the warranty by spending some more money to get it to work optimally,hey james i wa wondering wether you have heard of the swiss startup zuriga they reinvented the boiler and built a really expensive easy to handle espresso machine with good material from regional production and built in zurich maybe that is why it is so expensive a well i wa wondering wether you could get one and make a review,right on target rancilio and gaggia are the best option around that price range i have the gaggia for almost an year and it is all true it wa significan notly cheaper than the rancilio at the time here in canada so i think i made the right choice a i drink pure espresso way more often i would be disappointed buying anything that could not handle at least that fine grind i actually expected the gaggia to handle finer grind when i bought the gaggia there wa an option to have a pid installed by the seller but it wa a bit expensive good entry level machine but yeah you will get frustrated with the lack of temperature and pressure control milk frothing can indeed be inconsistent a new basket is a must you can easily find bottomless portafilters to use a scale and bigger cup i will stick to it until i can afford a decent,there is lelit anna with built in pid so it it much simpler than modding by yourself a for gaggia and silvia and actually lelit is very good company with good quality and good choice for different price range,hello james is not lelit anna in version with pid still fitting budget of 500gbp that would give lelit upper hand comparing to other machine what more there is 58mm lelit glenda that at least looking at price in my country could be around 500gbp and would address your concern about 57mm portafilter i think review would have been better if you had tried best lelit machine possible in this budget,what scale are you using i have a gaggia classic pro and none of my scale fit underneath,i remove the drip tray although the selenoid drip can be caught using a thin cup or a wand cleaning rag not perfect but useful,so i will be stirring with the fanciest lil teaspoon from the 1940s co i am a fancy man loved it haha,i have one problem with delonghi when i move or remove coffee machine lever all machine is moving,the dedica can actually make milk silky if you remove the auto frothing thingy you have a black rubbery steam wand with a little bit of getting used to you can steam one cup worth of milk and get a silky texture,so you put 18g in the lelit 57mm basket i have one too but use way le 14g should i use more,the reddit r espresso and home barista community will probably thank you for providing them with a link to provide 100 time a day to answer this very question in term of the review itself you are absolutely spot on and really provided a comprehensive assessment of the pro and con of each machine i really like that you covered the modding v out of the box feature given the hobbyist nature of espresso making a usual fantastic work,yep lol i am here because of r espresso,c j c hoffman video are never irrelevant,let is be honest they will link a hoffman video even if it is completely irrelevant,i am looking to by coffee machine for home my number on is la marzocco linea mini,but why not include a breville sage barista not just pressurised basket and a very easy way into the fun,i think it is worth pointing out that all the machine except the delonghi have 3 way solenoid valve,i have measured this gaggia is pressure to be 13 bar nobody know why manufacturer do this i managed to screw it down to 10 bar it is much better now but i do not understand how basket can influence taste is it real,can someone tell me what is the scale he is using,i use a dollar10 jewelry scale under my gaggia classic fit perfect especially with my naked portafilter although the standard one work too,proud owner of gaggia classic lt 3 i would not know what to do without it every morning i am using a 14g not pressurized basket were you using a 18g for the video,odd question on a espresso video but is there a good in between priced grinder from a hand grinder to a baratza,cool that wa great i have modded my gaggia and it make great shot but i am now selling it because i want flow control and pre infusion moving up to an ecm i think an ecm classika with a flow control knob attached if anyone want to give me good advice please do,i have the bambino and i am super happy with it though the point about sour shot is a fair one i have gotten some mindbendingly good coffee out of it but those are rare most of the time it make a perfectly serviceable espresso most of the time i am making espresso tonic and americanos and the milk steaming really is that impressive for such a small machine that is the thing i feel like did not get touched on here is just how teensy the bambino is it is so small for apartment small kitchen type it really is a godsend i would not have space for the gaggia or the rancilio anywhere in my apartment but the bambino fit beautifully onto my bar with space left over for a mat tamper and knock box that is a huge huge upside being only a little bigger than that barely even a real espresso machine little delonghi but still capable of making really good coffee and the water tank is easy to maneuver in and out of the little spot it is nestled into bottom line is i happily use the bambino every day frequently more than once and often pulling multiple shot in a row to make bigger latte or coffee for myself and my girlfriend and it is a pleasure to use doe it make perfect espresso every time no but i am no barista anyway it make perfectly good espresso unless i botch the bed prep it fit in my apartment like a glove i drew my first latte art with the milk that came from it and the button really are very satisfying i am very happy with it,jn881 i have the same problem shot are too acidic in general one problem is temperature too low i think the other is that it is difficult to go for smaller grind size,i have the bambino too and bought a naked portafilter and additional single wall basket work really well for me quick le messy and nice americano and latte,mervtones i am still struggling to pull good shot they are too acidic but i am just drinking espresso or long black no milk drink i have tried lot of different type of coffee from light to dark roast i am wondering if it is because the water doe not get hot enough to extract the coffee properly what kind of dose do you use and what is your extraction time,i have the bambino a well and agree with everything you said i wa evaluating machine at this price point for a couple month and landed on it due to size and feature another thing that wa not addressed wa heat up time the bambino is ready to pull a shot in 3 second which to me is also a godsend for every day use no turning it on and walking away for minute so everything heat up no needing to spend extra time to surf temp and cool everything down so i can pull another shot i have also found a decent sweet spot with my grinder and basket prep to get some well balanced shot from lighter roast depending on the coffee also ha maintenance indicator when you need to run clean and descale cycle all in all i could not be happier lot of bang for the buck,jn881 18 19 gram depends on the coffee really,lelit or expobar a it is called in other country build great machine for a relatively low price i have got brewtus iv pid dual boiler pid with e61 group head which is just an awesome machine,love this would also love to see you mod one of these preferably the gaggia because i plan on getting that one,i agree with the age of the delonghi i have mine for 2 year with daily use and i had to open it twice to fix something one after 18 month to replace a leaking plastic connector and second on the second year mark to replace a burnt spade electrical connection i might try the basket mod since the size can not be beat for my small apartment,did you already touch upon modding and pid ing,i own both a dedica and a silvia and love both the machine for different reason travel and home use respectively and you nailed everything about them that i love and hate about the machine you mentioned using different basket for them which one did you get for the dedica i am not a fan of the stock one and have been wanting a non pressurized basket i could use some recommendation,i purchased the dedica 3 year ago and it is collecting dust in my coffee corner for about 1 year because i switched to a pour over coffee now that i got 1zpresso jx pro for espresso should i go back to the dedica or is it too late for the machine life,any plan to do a comparison like this with pro consumer machine a best espresso machine under gbp5 000 video obviously not a obtainable for most but still i would be curious to hear your thought on option in that category particularly interested in your thought on the linea mini,i had some problem with the gaggia is steam power but i have noticed that if you purge the condensation before reaching the full steaming temperature 10 15 after pressing the steam button you get much better pressure to use also yeah that tray is atrocious,had the rancilio silvia enjoyed that for 8y wa allready second hand now a ascaso steel big improvement,love these comparison video next stop 500 1000gbp,changing out the portafilters in most of the machine reviewed is really a geek thing the average person watching your review of somewhat budget espresso machine will not bother many people wanting budget are in for the all or nothing experience off the shelf but also obtaining aftermarket item post covid is problematic i have checked and un pressurized filter in the right size are often simply not available or are really expensive due to shortage depending on your shipping situation still i am glad you broached budget offering a it give some benchmark but i think reviewing budget offering that come with an unpressurized portafilter stock would make more sense,the delonghi ha a feature where you can increase or decrease the temperature been the best espresso machine i have owned,am i seeing a frank one in the background,i have had the silvia for over 10 year now with no real maintenance need so far but i must admit that i bought a pid for it just a couple of month after getting it so you end up paying more but it will last you a good while,vettepwr23 i have changed it a couple of time but with a silicone one which last a lot longer than the rubber one,hopefully you have changed the brew gasket at least did not realize how dried mine wa until i changed it,i found a rancilio silvia at a thrift store about 2 year ago still had the protective plastic film on the drip tray and included the instruction manual cost me dollar12 fun to see james is thought on it,really liked this one i have the dedica currently and definitely feel the pain point you mentioned in the video hope you will consider reviewing machine under dollar1 000 thanks,bigglyguy aw man that is unfortunate i recently got a lelit victoria to replace the dedica and i like it a lot would recommend so far,i have had the dedica and a bambino the bambino died this week after only 7 month so i am back to the dedica i would forgotten how bad lukewarm over bubbled milk is you deserve better but do not get a breville sage,dammit james i am torn between the rancilio and the gaggia and you are not helping me decide haha actually you are thanks for the great video,thanks james brilliant summary the bambino wa previously sold at gbp220 i picked up mine on sale a a package with the sage smart grinder pro for gbp360 i think at that price point it is the best entry level espresso machine the milk drink out of this machine really are amazing i can not recommend it enough my favourite thing about it is that it is ready to pull a shot in 3 second,james have you ever reviewed the francis francis x1 got ground coffee i would love to see what you thought of that machine,amazing video i would like to have more video about milk all the weird science you now about it lt 3,i am in a strange place i bought a breville express and it work but sometimes it feel like something is not right and i want to be able to open it up and tinker with it but i can not i would love to adjust the pressure on the machine but i can not so hearing about a modding community on some of these other machine is very intriguing i may sell my express and perhaps get a rancilio also i wonder how difficult would it be to make an espresso machine from scratch,yes under gbp1000 next please make sure you grab the lelit mara x an e61 hx machine that you do not have to flush it incredible,i have a duotemp pro which absolutely never get mentioned anywhere make me wonder if i am missing out obviously it ha the breville sage name and warranty stuff maybe it is because it is a more entry level machine,i am sure the outtake or fails from making this would make it own great video,can you do a video on just steaming milk,i have a miss silvia with pid i am very happy with the result i get with my rancilio now that mr fancy james hoffmann ha chosen one i am even happier,how is about a refurbished sage barista express with warranty for le then the gaggia or lelit ha the feature ha the grinder for those that do not have that yet obviously and i would say ha a better build quality and non pressurized basket then the mini sage that is the direction i went in not yet owning a decent grinder actually swapped out my dedica for that it is a nice little machine to practice on and you can get bottomless portafilters with non pressurized basket for it if kitchen space is an issue that thing ha a seriously narrow footprint,enjoyed this video we have got a 2004 vintage gaggia classic and pretty happy with it agree with your assessment i would be super interested in a roundup of machine at the next price point say around gbp1000 1250 and to find out what would be a worthwhile rather than marginal upgrade,i have the delonghi and she is hurt by your word she treat me well every morning yeah we are from the cheap side of town but she look good in red and we do not drink milk any hoo x,me too i love my delonghi,ed keating i am glad i checked the comment section the delonghi did not seem to have it place between the other compared machine it looked like a nice machine to get into espresso and will look into these accessory if i get one the steam wand is important to me,ed keating hi ed may i know what kind of mod did you do to your encore to make it grind espresso grind,daniel moriss jeffery no problem happy if my suggestion help even the smallest bit please tell me if i am rambling though i do not want to bore you or come across a a know all grind is very important especially with non pressurised filter basket so if you really want to get better espresso more consistently having your own grinder is important i use a baratza encore with a small mod to enable it to grind fine enough for the unpressurised system electric grinder on the cheaper end of the scale probably will not be suitable for what you need it for and even some of the more expensive are made with a focus on grind consistency for a coarser grind for brewing method such a v60 filter but are not great for espresso it is worth doing some research and reading review if the thought of spending almost the price of the coffee machine again on a grinder put you off i am sure you could get a good manual grinder for le than gbp euro dollar100 it is a delicate balance getting the quantity of coffee fineness of grind and firmness of tamp correct if the coffee is too fine it is very easy to overtamp a bit of adjustment is to be expected when wouldialling in different coffee anyway even a the coffee age it may be necessary to grind a little bit finer to get a better extraction this is a great reason for having your own grinder that and of course the freshness each time you grind if you can persist and iron out some of these issue finding what work best for you i have no doubt the result will be worth it regarding the steam wand yes i feel it is been a worthwhile modification i have found a little technique in getting a nice steady flow of steam from the machine and with the proper frothing technique the milk is just that bit more textured more glossy and in the right hand not mine yet can make great latte art i will say that it wa frustrating at first because it took a while to get used to and the panarello already make decent milk just not quite a good a with the rancilio wand it is a toss up between the effort required and getting that little bit extra out of the machine,ed keatingis thank you so much for your really thorough reply there are some thing that i can look into for this which is great i am not sure if i am tamping too hard the grind is too fine using pact coffee espresso grind or if the pressure is wrong but i will give the weighing a try i have not found a definitive answer yet for the delonghi a apposed to other machine so thanks for doing the leg work finger crossed i get something better out of it doe the steam wand make a big difference to the milk once you have learned how to use it properly i thought that they needed at least 3 hole to get silky milk thanks once again,i own a gaggia classic pro and i must say that after a year of ownership i am quite pleased with it and it ha been greate at learning how to steam and pull shot however i have been thinking of modifying it anyone have any recommendation of mod i will soon acquire a ecm rocket giotto 1 generation doe anyone of have link to mod for that,i had a rancilio silvia for many year until it sadly died during lockdown which wa 100percent my fault and yes i had to temperature surf it also simple enough once you used it a few time never bothered with getting a pid i found it to be a good reliable easy machine to use and made great espresso and awesome cappuccino i have been waiting for the silia pro but after seeing it is price i would rather buy another silvia with a pid or have one fitted i found the silvia to be one of the better machine i have owned my biggest gripe i have with it wa filling it with water found it awkward and cumbersome and sometimes a little messy to do other than that wa quite fond of it but having a look around for other option,a a dedica owner with the same mod that james is showing i just wonder how it would be possible to fit 18 gram into that filter basket 15 gram is usually the limit for me a bit unfair trying to squeeze the amount you fit into a 54 mm basket into a 51 mm one that said with 14 gram in 30 32 out i have been lucky getting nice shot,super video very interesting to see the difference to the sub 100 category i hope that the new set get more acoustical treatment a the audio had some hiss and roomy weirdness to it that made it le enjoyable overall,bought my rancilio silvia in 2005 a a 1st proper esspresso machine indending to move on to something better when it expired these thing will not die however so i am still using it today spot on with the comment it a solid thing great steaming fiddly drip tray and tank will have to try a vst basket and see what difference it make,i live on the west coast of norway we love our coffee over here we have good coffee house but the majority still use drip feed machine in particular the technivorm moccamaster any chance of doing a review of drip feed machine sometime in the future,sorry to bother you again but what do you think the krups expert burr grinder you do not have to review it but any thought on it would be appreciated if it turn out it is not a good grinder then please recommend me a good electric burr grinder under gbp100 i am trying to get my coffee stuff on a budget thanks,love your video very informative i have the breville barista express quite happy with it but think it is over pressured which make it difficult very even extraction,thanks multiple friend of mine have been asking me my opinion of machine in this range i am going to recommend them the sage based on your review,the one reason why i went with the infuser over the bambino is temperature control,excellent video thanks i have owned a rancilio miss silvia and wa happy with her performance moved on to an old rancilio s26 which i am very happy with one feature i like is build quality and availability of part,agree w you trid the silvia dedica bambino but ended up w lelit glenda subgbp500 bigger boiler and e61 grouphead i am only missing the manometer the steam is same similar to the silvia,sip nescafe,i have bambino plus you can call it pro since i have single and double unpressurised basket and in this category it is a winner it ha ton of feature a you said even i do not use auto steam milk feature it is still there to be used some day easy to clean tiny place needed to be set pre infusion feature which i use every single time that help to get better espresso especially with difficult bean you might have experienced james you forgot to mention that the machine is ready in 3 second after you press the power button that is a big factor to choose between them anyways there are dual boiler machine hx machine etc i am thinking of upgrading one day just for fun but waiting for a machine will heat up in approximately half an hour for a single shot is a big no for me ridiculous time consuming for a single shot with bambino i just press the power button and viola it is ready to go instantly cheer,curious about the reasoning for going with the sage model you did we just purchased an infuser and so far are enjoying it wanted ease of use but not a fully automatic machine ours came with non pressurized basket,i quit my work thanks to p a i d t o b e h o m e c o m,such a shame you did not review the lelit with the pid controller probably gbp450ish i have the lelit with the pid and inbuilt grinder the complaint about the water tank are on the money 57mm portafilter is also annoying even more annoying is not providing a blank filter basket for backflushing that is another gbp20 if anyone know of a better 57mm basket james speaks of please let me know,we had a rancilio at work and it wa okay but i never got one because i could not resist the modding route and would like a complete package rancilio and gaggia those were the go to machine in this range when i looked into this 8 year ago looking forward to the next tier in this review series where i hope to discover something which is enjoyable out of the box that i can run out and buy,yayyyy so excited totally agree with chefpk below really dislike having to resort to pod and they create so much clutter too,maybe you can make a video about how to modify a gaggia classic pro,3 month ago james these under gbp100 espresso machine are terrible spend more money current james these under gbp500 espresso machine are not bad but you will want to spend more money and mod them my wallet can not keep up with james advice,just learn how to make really good pour over,matthew mers i agree with you and that is the main reason why i will not subscribe and probably will stop watching james,i agree buy the silvya or gagia of lelit at ghat money and forget modding them just learn to use them modding is for nerd who ob over water chemistry let alone bean type just use the thing and you will sus out how to get great result every time,j c,j c you are right i have spent 100 200 at starbucks coffee shop every month,changed the steam thermo on my classic and now stronger and longer pressure,hehe sound like speeding up with drinking all those espresso in the end,proud owner of gaggia classic here though need to upgrade my steam wand to rancillio v2 but overall i am satisfied with my gaggia because i am not really into milk base coffee drink what the matter most for me is having a good shot of my espresso everyday,thanks for the thorough review james what are your thought on the lelit anna that come with pid would that improve shot quality and how would it fair against the rancilio and classic i have had the gaggia evolution same internals a classic but no solenoid and struggled with shot always coming out bitter burnt tasting very eye opening that you also confirmed this wa from high pressure debating upgrading to the lelit anna for this purpose unless you think a better grinder is a better investment,how long should i wait for under 2500dollar video i just got my niche shipped i wa going to buy rocket r58,got the delonghi in april this year a month after starting wfh and suffered thru a month of self made french press and cold brew using fresh ground coffee i am not picky yes i do know how to appreciate a good cuppa and i am only trying to replace office nespresso kiosk coffee during commute etc that sort of caffeine std to thru the day best decision ever yes it wa never going to be barista quality but for the price ease of use and no access to proper coffee otherwise during lockdown this wa what kept work possible not going mad being locked at home with the family and surviving 2020,oh the memory i bought an old used gaggia classic once and modded it more then i pulled espresso from it added a pid a raniclio steamwand the work great machine super simple inside like old car they just work,by the way i would have been interested in a temperature test simply finding out if your first espresso of the day come out to cold or to hot,is not there a version of the sylvia that come with pid temperature control,aviphysics they are certainly premodded if there is a rectangular digital display box installed between the steam wand and the group enclosure auber pid for an aftermarket add on it is quite elegant solution,rachel fung when i wa looking at buying a machine last year i saw a lot of sylvia machine for sale that had pid but maybe they were just premodded,yes there is silvia pro though it is brand spanking new only came out in the state late august i think,doe anyone have a reliable source of info for modding a gaggia classic for pid temperature control and adjustable pressure i have upgraded mine with a brass shower holder ims screen silicone gasket bottomless portafilter and classic pro wand but now i am looking for the next step there is some old info on gaggiausersgroup com but they have been shutdown since 2018 i am especially interested in wireless pressure sensor pid temp control who is done this already,rancilio v breville dual boiler,is that a bwt penguin pitcher is this good enough to remove calcium from tap water and use for any of the machine presented i own a gaggia classic and have been making my own water following barista hustle is guide but wa wondering if this pitcher could get a similar result without the mess and effort of making my own water,a a sage owner not the bambino i have to admit that simply programming your shot and not having to use a scale or a timer is so easy going the next machine i buy need to have those feature or i will not consider it but all non standard 58 portafilters are a crime against humanity,not sure if you reply to comment but would you prefer one of the manual pump system rim or flair over the rancilio or do they not come close,curious for the same budget the sage barista wa express an option,i wonder why the aldi machine is not here,would like the next video to be best machine under gbp1300,i have been looking at the bambino plus a a future purchase and this really narrowed it down properly it appears i did good research and paid attention to your previous video,i just got the gaggia a month ago overall i like it but the steam pressure is tough to work with the shot are quite nice but i find i end up pulling slightly sour shot even with typical good brew time and ratio but great value really overall,very useful review,what would you or anyone knowledgeable recommend for just making quick adequate to good flat white mocha pot french press aero press filter thingo or a machine cheer,i recently bought the gaggia and i would concur with your assessment it take a fair bit of effort to get decent milk texture i am not ready to mod it just yet but i am glad to know that is a fixable issue one thing i am concerned about is that the steam wand valve tends to leak a bit do not know if that is normal i am very glad i did not go with the dedica the price made it tempting but clearly i would not have been happy with it,this video is at the exact right time for me i am thinking about getting a small machine and i thought of the sage this one in the video or the bigger one with grinder but now i am somewhat torn should i rather get the silvia is the silvia worth it if you are not into modding if anyone can offer some help i would really appreciate it,thanks great video i have a delongi scultura which is pretty similar to the dedica 2nd hand for around gbp80 i live in norway i agree with your assessment but have simply not been in a position to increase the budget further thankfully i have got much better milk result having cut away part of the panarello tube to expose the plastic tube underneath it is not a patch on something like the rancilio but i am finally making a decent flat white the main thing i do not like is not being able to find decent basket though i do use a non pressurized one and other part for the size of portafilter they use,george clooney chooses nespresso,have a silvia myself and these thing are absolutely built to last i got it 2nd hand modded it with pid the modding process made me realised how over built these machine are they are so simple yet just manufactured so well with really high quality part i do not plan on selling and upgrading the machine anytime soon perhaps will do a pressure gauge mod in the future the pid mod make a world of a difference i use an ims basket a well and together i am getting consistent delicious shot out of the machine it not for everyone but it is a hell of a beast and beauty built to last,i have owned a rancilio silvia with pid since march and it is been an absolute pleasure to learn on currently looking forward to getting a vst basket amp bottomless portafilter for it james is absolutely spot on about the build quality and steaming power,i have both the gaggia and the silvia i actually bought the gaggia about 10 year ago earlier generation it wa a great machine but unbelievably i found a rancilio silvia later model in a charity shop for gbp25 it is been working perfectly for a few year now major down point on the rancilio is the plastic covering over the group head make it look a bit cheap apart from that it is a great machine,thanks for this i wa waiting for this sequel review to pull the trigger on a machine and i would be choosing between the silvia and the gaggia classic if not for your la pavoni review now i am torn between those three lp is at a similar price point new which machine would you prefer,with the gaggia if you start steaming the milk before the ready light come on i find after about 33 second then the heating element stay on giving you way more steam power heat just a little quirk which is easily solved,james hoffmann please do review for oscar ii,by the way sage is the company is uk brand it is known a breville in the u,the answer wa wrong the answer should be which machine is best out of the box it should not be spend x but you have to spend y to make great coffee crap conclusion and lazy you know i am right,which commercial grade machine would you recommend,ive been waiting for thisssssss edit after watching the video sage bambino is the one for me thanks for the great video mate,in denmark the sage bambino come with standard basket,wow i wa waiting for a comparison with a silvia and classic pro unfortunately in still torn on which one to get based on this review such a difficult choice,what coffee scale are you using,very interesting video for me a i own a lelit and i am quite happy with it question and maybe an idea for a future video about the lelit you said that the pressure gauge wa a big plus in fact i do not really know how to read it how i can benefit from it my espresso that were in the right timing were more in the 10 bar zone and of course if i am at 8 bar there is something wrong but i have the same information with the time that will be very short i am really interested in some clarification on how to use the pressure gauge thanks,i have a fully modded gaggia classic set to 9 bar psi auber pid a 3d printed slim drip tray stainless steel heat sink bottomless portafilter with a vst basket ims shower screen amp the new gaggia pro steam wand installed the steam pressure issue are completely remedied after setting the machine to 9 bar which only requires a screwdriver turn not replacing any screw or spring actually alongside having the pid with the auber pid i have far more accurate temperature control and can manipulate brew and pre infusion time it really is a magnificent home espresso machine once you have done all of these thing that being said you have to enjoy that sort of tinkering which is a without a doubt a niche category of person would i rather have a rancillio silvia no not really but that doe not mean i would be upset to have one either were i to upgrade to a new machine at this point i would be looking for something with a greater feature set which of course would put me in an entirely different price range and require significan notly more countertop space my grinder is the eureka mignon specialita which i like very much except for the adjustment knob which i wish wa bigger to allow for a easier time with minute adjustment,disappointed that the sage barista express wa not included in this it wa my first machine and i thought it wa good it got me into coffee and i have upgraded since i know rrp may be higher but there are always deal and i only paid gbp360 for mine,well you described the silvia experience perfectly without a pid i am regularly frustrated with mine and am still trying to steam milk properly after owning it for several year you learn to temp surf plain and simple and then wait for the pressure to build for steaming definitely a hand on process focused machine which will make great espresso most of the time if you learn the quirk this is the 1970 is range rover of espresso maker if you are looking for the tesla experience then check out breville sage well really a jura in that lofty price range,a a delonhgi dedica owner i have to say i agree with you it is difficult to get a good espresso out of it there is this fame about this machine that made me buy it at that time i would have appreciated an honest review like this before i spent my money,i am disappointed in this review you did not test the machine a delivered which would have been of much more use to me rather you modded them a bit before even trying them i am referring to your use of some sort of substitute basket about which i know nothing and which may not even be available to me a well a to your tossing out of part they came with for reason i do not understand i do see that you were trying to get a good a cup from them a you could get to your taste with your broad and deep experience but what ha that to do with someone without your experience looking for advice on which machine to buy,got the sage bambino last winter and it is been awesome through lockdown working from home milk texturing seems really good and a a beginner i have found it is been good to learn on it is too light and that is a frustration but generally i am really happy for the money just need to get single wall basket now and start grinding some bean great set of review thanks,im a fancy man yes you are,i have the rancilio and i love it but i have been looking to change from the stock basket to something better what you you recommend,hey james i am sure you have gotten a thousand question about it or at the very least are aware of it but the silvia pro is now a dual boiler with pid and temp control i understand that it is priced at 1700 usd but is that one one of the best in that price range sub 3000 usd also a far a steam wand go do you believe that latte art competitor champion could train practice perfect their technique on a wand like one of these or would practicing on this quality of wand hurt your skill and muscle memory,old gaggia classic is the best choice can obtain for gbp120 ton of mod available,what is the better basket anyone,maybe carrying out these test with a budget grinder such a a baratza encore would have been better,sound like time for some kind of opensource machine at least that way you get build what you want,i am sorry james i do not think the sage bambino wa done justice first of all i got mine for 250gbp no 399gbp which is a huge difference secondly you can not over look the auto milk texture it wa a huge help when starting finally the water tank is huge for such a small compact machine,would you consider doing a wand review on the gbp100 machine or were they just shit haha,i am sorry james i do not think the sage bambino wa done justice first of all i got mine for 250gbp no 399gbp which is a huge difference secondly you can not over look the auto milk texture it wa a huge help when starting finally the water tank is huge for such a small compact machine,great video please also consider beeville barista express for future comparison,interesting but i wa hoping for much more information considering the pump especially also why not the sage duo temp pro still absolutely in budget but the larger machine compared to the bambino,dreaming of having between gbp100 gbp500,the robot or flair not neo paired with a bellman bodum for milk texturing will absolutely dominate all of these machine in shot quality at a way lower price it should be seriously considered at this price range much of the leftover budget can be added to the grinder budget to get an even better shot or at getting accessory like knock box good scale pitcher cup these machine are frustrating to use and most people will upgrade from it to something like the pro 300 in the future which also is not worth it imo if you have this setup,modded gaggia baby w pid and automated brew cycle yes the upgraded basket is an improvement also,for me espresso machine are a lot like pipe and cosmo moonstruck said it best then there is copper which is the only pipe i use it cost money it cost money because it save money so pay a little more and get a machine that tick all the box,i wa a nespresso pod user for home coffee until i found this channel a comandante c40 a pakt coffee travel kit an aram lever espresso maker and lot of fresh roasted coffee from chromatic here in northern california and now i am on a list for a decent one of the refurbs i enjoy plying with setting and i also enjoy the community aspect and learning from others work can not drink a nespresso fresh bean and a bit of work taste so much better,whats ha been your go too equipment for brewing at home during lockdown,occasionally i would have gone to an antique shop and wonder can i picture who would own a spoon case now it is obviously james hoffman,i have been owning a silvia for the past 4 year and i installed a pid on it classic auber kit 2 year ago to be honest i could not be happier now i really love it and you can really feel these machine are built to last however a i started my espresso and coffee journey with it i can not express how frustrating and unforgiving this machine can be especially for beginner,vettepwr23 really happy with the niche to be honest the ground are of really good quality and it ha been a real gamechanger in term of coffee wastage i feel like it is a really good grinder to have at home there wa a couple of popcorning issue in the first version but it now ship with the disc preventing these apparently i chose the unridged basket because i have a pullman big step tamper,pierre coquillot curious to know why one would choose ridged v ridgeless is it just so that it come out of the portafilter easier,pierre coquillot any regret or complaint with the niche curious since you have experience with several different one,vettepwr23 i am using 15g and 18g unridged vst basket a for the grinder i have been using a eureka mignon and a fiorenzato f4 nano both model are widely available in france before eventually getting a niche grinder about a year ago,i have a pid too since purchase are you still using the stock 14g basket if not what also what grinder are you using,are these machine all lined up starting to look like star war droids to anyone else,i have the gaggia pro for 1 year now i love this a my first machine i found to get better shot to my taste by releasing some water at the beginning of the infusion for about 6 sec maybe it is because it lower the brewing temp or the pre infusion i get from this method or both btw thanks for the vst basket tip i will definitely try one,i wonder how the quality compare to a flair or robot plus a dedicated steam device i think my flair make incredible espresso even better than friend dollar500 machine i generally do not care much about milk quality so a basic frother work for me when i want a milk drink,i have the silvia bought it used for about half price have installed a pid mecoffee use naked pf will get a vst basket 18 or 20g lack of drip tray float and water tank indicator are the biggest irritation look forward to the under 1000 group review with the lelit victoria my dream machine is a decent,like a few others have said i use a small plastic container that i purge or flush into been doing this since new i only need to drain the drip try after cleaning or backflushing the group head i have a 20g vst basket and never use it should have gotten an 18g since the stock double basket is 14g i believe,the dedica ha 3 temp setting set highest it is much better then i am using graef filter i just cut off the entire bottom part now it is bottomless still a bit acidic but controllable with a trick you never have to grab the machine to lock the portafilter lock the filter then try to move the machine it is a short learning curve but you learn to counter twist the machine movement,i am a bambino owner first your texturing of the milk made me grate my teeth i have been fighting for month with it for decent texture but it is my inexperience not the machine my only issue with it is the leak from the drip tray really also i have the sage grinder pro and with fresh roast week old i am finding 10 to 12 setting on a medium roast work well but i just can not get it to do le than 70ml extraction in about 20 second if i go finer it choke i use 18g of coffee in the standard basket any help or tip would be great to improve it but overall i love my bambino,for milk texturing manually this video is a good tutorial the drip tray doe leak sometimes for me when the steam wand auto purge this is the only thing that really annoys me about this machine and it can be solved by getting the wand to auto purge into an empty cup also i really recommend using a set of coffee scale and pulling shot manually with this machine this video show you how many of the other video that guy is uploaded onto his youtube channel on the bambino plus are worth a watch,which basket wa used in the gaggia i would like to upgrade my own,hey james i love your vids and have been wondering for a while whether you would say it is even worth it to get a super cheap espresso machine and arguably lower quality espresso or if one should just stick with cheaper brew method eg french press drip moka pot etc until they can afford a more expensive machine,great video in that price range the lelit pl41 tem could be picked instead that one is still significan notly cheaper than the rancilio and fit pid pressure indicator and proper steam wand love it,i am also surprised that there is so few fan seems like a very good machine,lvaro mart nez exactly i am a bit surprised that you do not hear more about the pl41 tem in general because it is the only machine i found in this price range with all these feature and solid quality i got lucky and snapped mine at the same price james paid for the anna,i have used a ranchilio commercial machine in the past and never liked them the gap from the portafilter to the cup wa way too big the steam wand seemed to wouldump steam into the jug and left you with hot milk and no texture the unit that wa reviewed look like the commercial unit too ie a big metal box,so the prettier they are the worse they are c,this wa a great rundown i started on the silvia and you are absolutely right the steam power is awesome and somewhat intimidating but really did not take all that long to get the hang of i will also agree about the water tank annoying to fill and too easy to overfill one of these day i need to build a refilling system for it,i needed this video right now and james delivers,man you are the shahrukh khan of the coffee world,go check my video im a breville bambino fan for beginner like me is the perfect machine,great a usual mr james though i would keep aeropress moka bialetti and invest in a premium hand grinder cheer,i own the silvia what basket would you reccomend for it so you would still use the stock portafilter but swap basket,wa looking for delonghi dedica but i found out that there is a bunch of cheap semi automatic machine on aliexpress for 160 eur you can get awfully built machine but with pressure gauge timer and 58mm holder for sure it ha instant heat but seems able to produce 11 bar,great video a always lelit is a great brand such a shame you did not encounter with the pid and the traditional 1 hole steam wand version of the anna i bet that one would have kick silvia is butt and for le money they also make a 58mm version btw thanks james keep these video coming,just sold my dedicated today i am looking for a substantial upgrade it will be dearly missed though it wa my first espresso machine and it got me into espresso,love the quirkiness of the dedica is drip tray at 3 53 it stick it tongue out at you when it is full,if i wa new to steaming milk i would make a mess a whole bunch of time hey that describes my experience trying to learn to steam milk on a silvia it ha been quite frustrating,try steaming into an empty container a the first bit of steam is rough it then settle down thats when you steam milk worth a shot,i do not owe anyone anymore thanks to p a i d t o b e h o m e c o m,so they are all a bit crap from the factory until you modded them your review should have been based on that it tell u what the maker think is good enough for the budget oriented peon who would not know upgrading is an option,awesome just day ago i found a used 2016 gaggia classic for dollar100 it came to me dirty a hell but i am excited to clean out the dust amp learn to make real espresso once it is up and running i hope to use the saving to upgrade the filter basket grab a bottomless portafilter and i have heard you can mod better steam wand from other machine onto it since i have that panarello doodad,been using a silvia for over ten year now added a pid and wow it really work well would love the r58 but simply can not justify spending that much when miss silvia ha paid for herself and then some another great video,been waiting for this one,great video james audio feel a little off for me on this one sort of a swirling type sound in the background that i can not place not sure if it is to do with any of the filtering you are using or something to do with trying to remove the reverb that room cause just a small thing but thought i would let you know,i am a silvia owner and i do agree the temperature variability is a challenge the machine is very unforgiving and leaf you struggling to pull a really good shot at the same time though that make it a great learning tool the coffee is even more enjoyable when you do get it right because of all the effort you have put in to produce it,dedica fit a small room or apartment very well and to my eye it beautiful and innovative im using this in combinatio with kg 520 grinder for 2 year and i am really happy with it it and very good value for money grinder pump lt 300euro it did faiil few time when i used a very fine ground from a nearby shop but with kg 520 grinder s finest setting it work well,hello thank you james i wa waiting for this one i own a dedica with rancilio wand and non pressurized basket and lack texturing power indeed both hand necessary for locking in portafilter wa looking to upgrade into something better for steaming and texturing and almost bought a classic now will hold that decision until demoing maybe try the new rancilio silvia pro would love a video comparing steam and texture of breville sage thermojet v rancilio boiler,bless you dude i wa waiting for this one,i want to point out though that i got myself a delonghi dedica 685 m from cyberport a german store with household item a well at the lowest possible price during a 2nd price drop sale for 139 eur since all other machine were quite a lot more expensive and mr hoffman said the espresso shot wa not a hot regarding shot temperature gt this can be configured on the machine though and yes milk steaming is quite weird with it tbh,i have a gaggia classic pro and you are spot on one small free trick is to essentially temperature surf the steam power once you get more comfortable with the machine you learn how long it take for the steam light to come on the trick is to start steaming before the light come on this trick will keep the heating element on and act more a a thermoblock you get actually very good steam power this way but it doe take some effort and experience similar to temp surfing brew temp not ideal but not too difficult after a few week with the machine,i am owner of the old gaggia classic it is nearly the same machine like james is testing his opinion about it is absolutely spot on,the silvia being the same price a the ps5 really make me hesitate,i bought my silvia in 2005 had a ps2 at the time now i have a ps4 and am looking at the ps5 for christmas i have tweaked a few thing on the silvia over those year but it is still going strong,gurpster can confirm mine ha been in daily use for 14 year,the ps5 make really great espresso,the silvia a will last longer,timestamps start of how the espresso shot review will work 07 18 espresso with machine 07 18 lelit anna 08 47 delonghi dedica 10 32 rancilio silvia 11 53 sage

you,sticksomechopsunderthegrill quite the opposite but i had lunch so figured why not write it down while at it thank u though forthecommunity,clearly you have way too much time on your hand but love your work,literally the video i have been waiting for,i too am a fancy man 1 for that fancy spoon case,im a proud owner of a gaggia classic pro and i have pulled many a great shot with her she is a sterdy a a tank and i only have had one issue it ha recently started to leak water from the gasket unfortunately i am too lazy to fix it so i just press a dish rag up against the portafilter a im espressoing,for 57mm basket ascaso make made brand distributes a great 14g max double basket that originally shipped with the brass boiler version of the ascaso dream it ha straight sidewall and full perforation on the basket base,i have had my miss sylvia for five year love it temperature surfing and got used to it and it work well probably going to install a pid,i did a mecoffee i recommend taking the plunge,shock the by far most expensive is the winner still loved the review but that one could have been phoned in,i have been using gaggia classic pro for almost two month now and i spent the first couple week getting to know the machine at factory setting i have to say my experience with the steamer is totally different from yours i thought the steamer wa very powerful and it worked the milk almost too fast for me part of it probably due to the fact that i usually steam only small amount for piccolo and the milk rose to the desired temperature so fast that it wa a bit hard to get proper milk texture at first note that i live in thailand and the model sold here could be a bit different after couple week i installed the opv mod spring to switched to 9 bar and loved it a week later i installed pid controller both mod actually came at the same time but i decided to install one at a time to see how much each of them affect the machine is performance and i got two thing out of it the shot are now very consistent because i now know what temperature i am brewing with and no more surfing the second benefit is that the pid also control steamer temperature so i adjusted it to be a bit le powerful about 140c not sure what is the factory set up wa but it wa higher for sure so i have more time to steam my small portion of milk all thing considered i have to say i am very happy with my gcp and a bit surprised to see it came in last in the steaming race love your review though and i have to say i knew from the get go you would pick gcp and miss silvia lol,alyssaschroeder yep that is what i heard from other people too i mean it is not a bad thing i imagine steaming for two normal size latte would be a delight considering how fast and strong the steam wand is but when you only do milk for one piccolo at a time like i do that power is a bit overwhelming,actually your experience with the milk is what i have read online a well everyone said it wa very fast and strong so i wa surprised by what he said seems like everyone tweak the time they begin steaming to counter the problem,i have the delonghi and i really like it definitely price wa a major factor in choosing it i use dark roast either sumatran or a random but consistent arabica this is the first espresso machine ihave owned that can produce steamed milk with good body without souring the milk i get consistently delicious coffee drink from it three time a day every day to be fair i am not a purist sometime soon i would like to try the non pressurised filter to see what difference it make but if you are looking for a cost effective dependable machine and are willing to experiment a little with temp time and grind it provides a lot of bang for the buck,i just want to add that yes you might want to mod a rancilio and it might add to the cost but i think this is a massive plus for this machine the ability to grow a you learn and add v waiting much longer and saving more money to buy a more expensive machine with feature you do not understand yet might be even more frustrating it is hard for someone new to understand the impact of a pid in the cup this machine ha room to grow and you can grow with it it is a fantastic starting point,great lineup james thank you i have a very old rancilio silvia and a rocky grinder that my brother bought second hand from italy and i brought back over to the uk in my luggage on your least favourite budget airline having the 9kg rocky in my carry on bag raised some eyebrow in security but i wa through with some bruising from backpack strap by the time i got home what we do for love they make a great shot that i enjoy every morning i have very hard water and even though i filter i get scaling issue more often than i wish i had i am currently thinking about upgrading my grinder to a smaller and more efficient model but i am happy with the silvia maybe i could tinker and make it better maybe another machine would take up le space on my counter top but a a daily cup i am very happy after many year of service to me and who know how many year of service in it life before me,well i actually have one of these in a way at least so i am able to finally chime in my machine which i purchased earlier this year for eur 519 90 would be the lelit anita or pl042temd to give it it correct designation it is a slight step up from the entry level anna that you tested the most noticable difference of course being the inbuilt grinder more on that later the anita also come with pressure gauge toggle switch a much improved steaming wand and a pid i had to add a bottomless porta filter distribution tool and tamper for the lelit is non standard 57mm design i did look into better basket which are available but have not yet decided to get one your vidoe will probably result in me ordering one okay so the grinder really is not that great not a surprise but certainly frustrating especially when you are just starting to get serious about your espresso in the end i gave in and bought a commandante which doe a much better job at grinding for espresso based drink the lelit grinder still get use for coarser setting like vietnamese phin drip filter coffee or the mokka pot though actually i wa not that interested in having an inbuilt grinder to begin with it is simply the only machine in this price range at least with a steam wand on the left side which did matter to me so doe it make decent espresso absolutely no problem frothing milk either thanks to the better steam wand it is still a single hole design but omni directional and well it just seems to work fine no issue regarding pressure or temperature either the other weak design choice which you pointed out are of course valid but in general it is a very capable little machine for the beginner mistake are repeatable no electronics to hide anything from the user and overall solid build quality it did take me two or three month to finally get to a point where i am happy with what i can do with it and the coffe it produce often far better than what pass a espresso in coffee bar okay i do invest in fresh high quality locally roasted bean too,got my new basket on saturday and while this might be a case of confirmation bias my shot seem to taste much better indeed i am currently using a very classic italian blend passalacqua mehari though hard to tell if the same applies to lighter roast but i am pretty impressed for the time being at around eur 12 it is not exactly outrageously expensive to upgrade either,roberto falk i did find the stock grinder to be slightly inconsistent with shot quality varying more than you would expect which made dialling in very difficult at time it also felt like i wa getting overextraction and underextraction at the same time due to grind quality not being uniform enough switching to the comandante c40 absolutely confirmed my suspicion regarding the grinder there is a very noticeable improvement in sweetness and general quality and texture now of course ymmv,dan cosma you can get a ims competition series basket designed to fit 57mm porta filter amazingly they are currently out of stock meaning i probably bought the last one you might be able to find them elsewhere though or wait until they become available again,hey i have the same model pl42em where can i find better basket for it,with a steam wand on the left side which did matter to me this wa one of the first thing which called my attention to lelit haha i though i wa the only one haha crazy that all i read here relates so much with me my experience with it is pretty much the same also,james why not include the duo temp pro it can be had in this price range and appears to be one of the most popular semi affordable machine,no la pavoni,you should link the aftermarket filter you used,the sage also heat up in 3 second both for espresso and steaming milk it also had a solenoid valve,i wa originally looking at such a machine but since my research and questioning professional for their take they recommended i go for a lever machine so i am surprised a pavoni wa not discussed despite it being slightly higher than the 500gbp mark when new,i got the gaggia pro back in march and your analysis match my own experience the brew basket portafilter and grouphead seal definitely needed to be upgraded to make better espresso while i wa thankful for the le vigorous steam wand on the gaggia for learning i do with it had a bit more oomph i am currently looking at mod to squeeze every inch of ability from the gaggia the rancilio look great but with gbp100 for mod on a machine that is gbp100 gbp150 more at the start which is gbp150 i could put towards mod on the gaggia and have an arguably better machine for the same cost,the sage seems great feature wise but it look just so meh if they built it in the case of the lelit i would be hard pressed to not buy it,sacrificing his health by chugging espresso to give u great content the hero we need but do not deserve,o goodness i wa worried i wa about to regret buying a silvia,this is a relief i am watching this while waiting for my gaggia classic pro to be delivered glad to see it did well even though i am mostly interested in milk drink do not think i could justify the step up to the rancilio,same here stuck between the two but the silvia is a 200 euro price difference god i hate having to decide,a much a i would like a machine for espresso and espresso based drink i think the reality for me is i can not afford the one i would want for home even dollar500 600usd plus another dollar100 in mod is pushing past what i would allocate i am pretty happy with my moka and v60 when i want the espresso experience i will visit a local coffee shop shouting to emphasize not a corp chain that burn all their roast otoh i am sure there are plenty who feel more than able to spend that in pursuit of home espresso and if i lived somewhere without local shop i might change my mind,yes yes yes yes and yes the timing could not be more impeccable,nice review i own the rancilio and it ok for it price only gripe other than temp stability is that the flow using naked portafilter is not uniform always more from one part,joined patron today after watchimg subscribing on youtube for almost a year now,please did you run a shot of water through the dedica to pre heat all the part i have seen temperature chart that show that it is crucial and it would hugely affect your result thank you for the video excellent choice of machine i would perhaps also include some ascaso they have been implementing excellent next gen thermoblocks,richard hammond for coffee,fanciest man,look like the rancilio silvia is close but i do not want to buy one and mod it if an even better machine is only gbp750 waiting the next segment that review machine under gbp1 000 hurry up i need some espresso,my advice buy a fairly new quickmill for under gbp500,hey james it would be interesting in some opportunity if you could cover in greater detail the difference between standard and pressurized portafilter basket love your content cheer,my parent have a de longhi in their home but it is not very good at all it is the only machine which can fit their limited counterspace if you have a grinder finding another basket it is an imperative otherwise you have to grind very coarse or buy ground coffee for moka pot we have cut the bottom of the pressurized basket with the late and we have had better result but the coffee we get often is not very good living in italy the coffee is a medium roast i often found the coffee too cold i think that the thermoblock is not able to reach the correct temperature and the group ha too little thermomass to compensate the steaming is quite slow and the milk is way to much foamy i think that any of the other italian machine better lelit rancilio or gaggia choice,recommend a used breville sage duotemp underpowered steam wand not necessarily a bad thing if you are new but a consistent 9 bar and ha a pid great little machine that you can get used for around dollar300,i had the silvia for 6 year up until two month ago can confirm everything the fancy man said the steamer is scary at first and the temperature varies wildly so i switched to a sage dual boiler and we are very happy together,sound similar to u but we went from a saeco via venezia which seems similar to the gaggia in term of not quite enough volume in steam and temperature fluctuation made occasionally spectacular coffee but mostly not bad the breville dual is a solid performer so far would not mind a touch more oomph steaming but love not having to wait a minute to steam and spend a minute doing it now temperature control is great,can someone clarify the size of the basket used for the dedica i think james say 54 mm but all product i have seen a replacement for this are listed a 51 mm,review the fellow ode brew grinder,about ten year ago i very suddenly can not remember the reason got super interested in espresso and i eventually got the rancilio silvia i wa not very good at making espresso though later i applied for a job a a barista and got to enjoy all the luxury of commercial espresso machine like la marzocco every day i eventually settled on pour over for my home coffee and sold my silvia since i did not enjoy the hassle of heating up this little tank of a machine every day and doing all the step but it is a great little machine,22 19 minute video yes yes,wa considering this level of machine but went with a simple e61 hx instead i do not have to deal with all of these barrier i wake up and i make great coffee no issue,sumit bajaj appartamento nera went with quality over bell and whistle le expensive than the mara x which wa the other choice for me,which one did you buy,i think a better video would be to slightly increase the budget 600 pound and include machine like the breville barista express,if you were to compare a silvia modded to your specific want you said in this video an extra 100ish euro to espresso machine in the next price bracket 500 1000 how would it compare to those i lived with a friend who had a silvia and i really enjoyed using it and am considering buying one for myself and would be interesting in modding a you suggested but am also constrained by it price if i were to need to put another 100 into it to get it performing exceptionally well would it be better to just buy a 600 700 machine and if so what machine in that price range should i consider i do not know much about those and only have first hand experience with a silvia,i changed over to the sage recently and think your comment are pretty spot on swapping out the entire portafilter for one of sage other 54mm sized brand and getting rid of the plastic insert made a big difference in quality one thing that you did not cover which really make the sage stand out is time before ready to brew that first shot the sage is up and ready really quick which is handy when you do not have a heap of time in the morning for that shot the self purge temp dump on the steam wand is also great although you do need to emtpy that drip tray often,i have had my silvia for 12 year while the faff factor is real e g need to learn temperature surfing it doe not take long to get it to acceptably reliable for me the best mod you can make is getting a better grinder i started with the rancilio rocky and i have used a baratza vario and eureka atom both of those were loaner from friend now grinding with a niche zero to eliminate the current level of faff in a new machine requires a pretty massive jump in price happy to be wrong here the quirk of this machine teach you a lot about making espresso and while i certainly get that many people will want to buy their way past most of these thing it is been a great part of my coffee journey,k wiljanen thanks just what i needed to know have ordered a vst whats so special about decent do you think the hole are more precise,jeremy dagger i have got a vst and it is great but i have used other brand a well with no complaint i have not used but would like to try the basket from decent or do you mean which size basket that is personal pref right,very happy with my modded silvia and niche grinder but would like to know which is the best basket for this setup,k wiljanen just fyi 1st line sell lelit mara for dollar1529 and it ha pid,k wiljanen any regret it complaint about the niche,nice review which basket for the silvia would you recommend i have the stock one,for my fellow american gbp500 is dollar650,james did you really drink 5 espresso back to back on the same day,i am wondering why there is all this concern about the drip tray and float just empty it every time a part of the pre brew checklist,excellent video a always james i would love to see a video for hx v db with pid basically what would be the best value performance in the next level up from a single boiler is it worth it to go db or is hx with pid good enough basically what is the best compact non single boiler espresso machine that is reasonably sized and provides good temperature stability at the group head,i have had a,would love to see something about the warm up time needed to go from espresso to steaming and back on these machine when dealing with multiple drink i would assume the sage is the quickest but not sure,the sage is i have a different sage machine and it is almost instant,have had a stock silvia for year now and love it it took some learning of the machine is idiosyncrasy before i could pull good shot but i now do so regularly got it for about dollar200 on the used market and it ha been worth every penny wa originally planning on adding a pid but never got around to it at this point i think it would just be a headache that would force me to unlearn all my temp surfing muscle memory,finally i wa waiting so long for this video,if you make another video like this for under gbp1000 you should check out the ascaso dream pid,how do these compare to the breville machine,the gaggia classis wa my first espresso machine unfortunately the morning after my first day using a commercial espresso machine while knocking out the posterfilter forgetting it did not have the same heft a the linea i had been using the previous day the whole machine slid off the counter top and wa never the same again oh the memory,the delonghi dedica ha adjustable temperature,wow these are some heavy espresso machine,i need to start referring to certain people a pressurized basket,is your moka pot clean,which filter wa used for the sage or do you guy have any recommendation,sebastian schumacher the neo us a pressurised basket yes the rest of the flair use unpressurised basket,sebastian schumacher a far a i know the flair machine use u pressurized basket,i have a couple of colleague i would describe a pressurised basket case,thank you for the great video i have dedica japanese version it ha lower powered pump due to voltage issue i have changed the portafilter to an aftermarket bottomless portafilter and it improved the overall experience significan notly not a high pressured a gaggia or silvia but the temperature can be changed to hotter setting did swap out the steaming wand to silvia steam wand which also made the milk frothing experience much much better living in a tiny 20 m 2 apartment in metropolitan tokyo dedica is small footprint make a great choice i have used breville sage barista before but is way too huge for my kitchen overall if one is willing to make few modifying and up their skill it a great choice if i had space then i would go for gaggia though,i wanted to get the rancilo at home but i have only seen it in the u for roughly 750 lately i went with the gaggia classic back in june 3 month later i am still very happy with it,i have the gran gaggia style have the same problem with putting my scale and espresso cup underneath the portafilter not a huge fan of the steam arm on it but i would say all in all a solid 8 10 glad to see you finally have gaggia on your channel,did you get your non pressurized basket from sage breville or somewhere else i am still looking for one but sold out on their website,i wa excited to see some not terrible contender in this bracket besides the obvious decent prosumer option finally a price bracket that actually make sense to buy,when i wa in the market for a machine around this price a couple of year ago i wa looking at the gaggia classic rancilio sylvia breville sage duo temp pro and the ascaso dream the dream is aesthetic won me over instantly and i liked the feature set the build quality is phenomenal it is super solid the switch are super satisfying to use and i get to look at a beautiful bright orange art deco thing on my counter every morning i did load of research before jumping in but i wa new to the espresso game and dramatically underestimated how badly i would want a 58mm basket the dream is odd 57mm basket proved to be frustratingly restrictive a i started to get a handle on thing i have looked high and low and can not find any other basket option apart from the stock ascaso basket in hindsight that alone might have been enough to push me to the classic or sylvia,joan solanelles hey thanks so much for pointing me in that direction that is really helpful,i had the same problem with my lelit 57mm can be frustrating check out ecafe e they have a section dedicated to 57mm accesories i found a vst filter 12 18gr for 57mm group a well a tamper and levelling tool i live in spain so i do not know what the shipping cost would be to where you live but it is worth checking,on lelit pl41 series i found that i never have to empty the drip tray somehow so little water get in there that it dry off faster than it fill up,the silvia wa my entry to many year of daily espresso for my wife and myself i did eventually add the pid which wa easy i wa able to buy mine used with little wear and i sold it for what i paid for it when i upgraded to a dual boiler prior i had the starbucks barista saeco with the pressurized portafilter and pod i wa unable to get anything good with that set up i wa mystified why i had to spend so much for a machine but so glad i finally did james ha done a service for you with these honest review i wish they were around for me back in the day,alex lazaridis f the newer one with a conical valve mine is older there is a strada mod but i am happy the way it is,wsurfn thanks the linea is out of my price range right now it look gorgeous just curious though you can adjust the flow when pulling a shot on those right,alex lazaridis f it wa quite a long time ago i upgraded to a alex duetto for several year and then lucked into a barely used gs3 that i love to use everyday this wa about a year before the linea mini came to market i am sure i would have purchased lmlm and stopped had i not stumbled on my gs3,what did you upgrade to i am thinking of upgrading from my gaggia to an ecm classika,weak steam on the gaggia can be fixed by replacing the steam sensor to a 55c,silvia by default is set to 12 bar and you can install pid on it with extra 50dollar i think you should notice that,i think the country of origin coo would be a helpful bit of information particularly at this price point thanks,great video james this is exactly what i wa looking for something in the not too expensive though not cheap price range,rancilio comment used a silvia for many year and put a pid on it almost immediately even with that it wa often a struggle to maintain proper temp at the brew head could not agree with you more james otherwise it wa built like a tank and pretty fun to use,about 4 day after i have bought a machine you bring me this joke aside good review a always james i have a bit of a bias hoffmann i did actually buy a gaggia classic but it is a used one from 2002 work excellently though,12 08 is probably the manliest portafilter slap i have ever experienced,lock and loaded make my day,great day,please do one of these vids but up to 1000 love the content,i have owned a gaggia for 6 month now and i pretty much agree overall i love it but like you said the large drip tray is annoying and playing the temp surfing game to avoid having a steam assisted shot is really annoying a a beginner i actually like the lower power steaming one other bummer is i have noticed is the chrome is starting to flake a bit on my grouphead overall i would give an 8 10 a great first espresso machine,have the gaggia classic ordered a pid kit just after watching this video your comment about the consistency were spot on,you made the right choice with the pid get a 9 bar spring from shade of coffee cheap get precision basket i have been making great espresso on my gaggia,can you share the portafilters you swapped in for each,could you please also review illy x1 anniversary coffee machine and also illy x7 1 iperespresso coffee machine thank you so much,i disagree about the two first thing about the lelit the water tank is the same than other semi pro coffee machine just smaller it is great that lelit put this little reminder in it also i do not see a greater way to see what is the water level than with your own eye,btw lelit is a really good brand you should get your hand on too,now you need to make best 1000 pound espresso machine i would love to see your take,,wow i paid 140euros for my dedicas 1 i have immediately depressurized the basket 2 i have open backed the portafilter 3 i never used the panarello even the silicone nozzle alone is better the ec685 i e 2nd gen dedica will need a zip tie holding the nozzle in though 4 just this week i ordered a rancilio silvia wand for it at lt 200euros there really is not anything in sight that can come close and they are built substantially better than even similarly priced delonghi machine,that wa great video i have gaggia classic pro and your point are valid it is a great gateway drug before spending more money on espresso machine i will be ordering vst basket a a first upgrade,have the silvia at home and it ha a steep learning curve have not been able to get the milk texture right a yet 3 month on could you do a proper review about using silvia,i owned one for 7 year and it take a little bit to get used to if i recall correctly when you roll your milk you can use an up down roll a opposed to sideways the steam wand ha just one hole but when you watch milk steaming guide on commercial machine a lot of time they have 2 or 4 it is pretty easy to end up with not well combined milk a lot of thick foam on top if that end up being the case sometimes you can also pour it out into another pitcher to give it a good mix there are a couple of silvia specific video on youtube if you search for them,yep 8 feel you i have hade mine from 5he same amount of time and i am hopeless at it,any reason for using the non pid version of the lelit anna the pl41tem pid is under gbp500,wish i watched this before i go my sage it a good coffee machine but the built in grinder and non standard puck size irks me,i have an old classic that like the pro can have pressure reduced i did but not tested measured it is a great machine for working on and modding fair comment about the steam wand i have always thought it wa just ok i would like to see a product like the classic but with twin boiler,i wish if you do a review for la marzocco linea mini and whether it doe worth the big fortune price,i have been really looking forward to this price range comparison ha anyone had any experience with an ascaso dream i am looking for my first espresso machine and i know someone selling a used ascaso for a third of the retail price any advice,i have silvia since 2010 and i can not agree more it is a beast and durable the only frustration is the inconsistency in temperature and the boiler is too small to pull more than two shot in row,thanks for putting this video together james i researched these bad boy for month before purchasing the gaggia classic pro i am using the kinu m47 simplicity a my grinder and it is a really nice pair since may i have been able to pull some beautiful shot although the consistency from the machine is unfortunate having a bottomless portafilter help to create more space for a scale and cup steaming and texturing milk wa frustrating for the longest time but over the past few week i have been getting really nice result for anyone who want amazing value and desire to pursue great coffee i would recommend the gaggia classic pro for sure,i own the gaggia classic pre 2015 it is actually heavily modded now pid better steam wand upgrade to shower screen holder shower screen gasket basket and finally the pressure down to 9 bar i do not really do milk drink so lately i have been wondering about the diminishing return between my current setup and a better machine something like the profitec 300 how much of an upgrade in quality would i actually be able to see in the final cup,you left the steam button flipped on the silvia while doing the conclusion,would you recommend single dual boiler or heat exchanger for home example la pavoni domus bar v rocket appartamento,best part of this review is at 15 05 for a fellow niche zero enthusiast thank you,why am i so happy that the gaggia classic pro i bought is on james list,bxrosie04 yeah it doe i just change out the water tank every couple day and give it a wash also switched to good water filter hopefully help with that,ash01live doe the water in your gaggia get scummy after a few day do the hose get slimy i am trying to figure out how to fix that issue on mine but i am stumped hahaha,matthias reik hey sure head to shadesofcoffee co uk there a guy who sell the opv spring set to lower the brew pressure to 9 bar and pid kit for really reasonable price he is super knowledgeable and helpful and will ship anywhere in the world hope that help it totally worth the money i promise you,ash01live can you provide detail of your mod,me too i bought the classic and i agreed with everything james had to say about it i recently installed a pid on it and a 9 bar opv spring the machine is in another class now with the pid you get super consistent brew temp and also massively improved sustained steam pressure id highly recommend it to all classic owner,this is the video i have been dreaming about my machine here and the one i want to buy next even with the modification of the baskey with i totally did i could not ask for a better comparison by the james himself let is see if i still feel like my next machine would be the gaggia after watching the video,mmm the rancilio is pretty good but the gaggia ha a better size and cost,great review is it in your plan to review budget coffee grinder not the manual one another great video btw,great review a always i am so proud to have been an influence on your career wishing you all the very best,you just haaad to post this after i purchased my delonghi dedica i hope to god it win watching now,come let is be honest it is competing out of it league here still doe not mean you made a bad decision if you are just getting into espresso and do not want to break the bank then it is great but after a year you might want to upgrade try spending money on a grinder first a that is more important than the machine the good espresso machine can wait,i love this video but i did notice something off with the video quality noisy video maybe,james i l be stirring with the fancy teaspoon because i am a fancy man me mhmm yes i am also fancy i think to myself a i stir my iced coffee with a straw,,leopold bloom metal always metal for fancy men,metal glass or bamboo straw for the plastic one are a no go for fancy men,i have an older gaggia classic i bought for 100dollar cad used i love tinkering and modding i have already modified the pressure steam wand portafilter and fixed a number of part next step is pid all the part are easy to find and to install there is nothing to keep you from running this machine for a lifetime which is a huge selling point for me in an era of increasingly disposable appliance electronics,thanks for a balanced review great a always proud to have encouraged you in coffee,great review james i have always dreamed of a rancilio silvia it continues to stand out from the crowd a the most affordable proper espresso machine i am always looking out for second hand one but people seem to keep them once they have got them which is a good sign i guess interesting to hear about the ecosystem of rancilio user that is a big plus i had not thought of oh well back to my moka pot for now cheer,gaggia classic take is spot on opv mod is absolutely necessary in order to get good shot out of this machine and definitely the steam pressure be something to be desired a there is just not enough however i think these machine last forever a long a you take care of them which is great and plus you can pick up one of these used for cheap which would give you the budget to add a pid get a new steam wand to replace the steam one on the older one buy a new basket buy a bottomless portafilter and just improve it and be at a lower price point then the rancilio however if i wa able to get a rancilio at a lower price point say dollar200 i would probably buy and switch over just for the steaming power because i make milk drink all day long,i bought my gaggia classic back in 2015 for 250 euro new that wa it price back then and i wa very surprised to see that even the store i bought it from sell it for around 350 now what justifies this price bump you can still find it in other place at around 300 even now though that change a lot this review because the price to value ratio is perfect you can spend that 200 euro difference with the silvia and put some mod and make it perfect,650 usd is a lot for an espresso machine you would really have to like espresso,i need an espresso,hey james loved this video i have a bambino plus and would love to know what portafilter basket you changed it to i am using the double shot basket that came with it at the moment,phil griffith so sorry for not replying i did not notice i had a notification i do not comment on yt enough haha thanks phil this is super useful,james said in an earlier reply that he used the sage breville 54mm unpressurised basket,please do a video on nanopresso minipresso portable espresso maker it seems very interesting,i am so excited for this i am getting married soon and i have my eye on the gaggia pro,i have the delonghi and i can relate to you it is a nice small machine and that is the reason i bought it i wa able to get decent espresso out of it after tinkering with the temperature and the grind size i also bought a non pressurized portafilter for it did not want to mess with the stock one for what i paid for it i am satisfied with the quality i will be most likely buying something better later on but for now it is fine for my morning coffee,a a filthy poor i feel it is my duty to remind you not to review thing outside of their weight class thing like how dial feel or how much external plastic is used doe not really matter much when looking at a budget item what that matter is how well doe the machine function analogy although a toyota camry and roll royce phantom are both technically 4 door sedan you certainly should not review them under the same scrutiny,in this price range i really love the quickmill 820 i have owned one for the last 25 year now i use it on holiday and when my big machine is away for service i gave one to each of my two daughter when they started their study,i am still using my gaggia classic i bought ten year ago modded with a pid to help with temp and increasing steam pressure,12 08 that crisp smack tho,i used to have a silvia and it wa frustrating to use until i added a pid to eliminate the need for temperature surfing while the build wa solid it wa unrefined rancilio do not put much effort into making it look and feel slick it is unapologetically industrial and i once cut myself rather badly on a sharp edge on the drip tray grate,it would have been really cool if you managed to review the lelit anna with pid pl41tem it is pretty much the only single boiler non thermoblock pid machine out there below 500quid any chance to catch up with that one,hi james great vid a always love your approach of thing just a bit surprised on the lelit choice review since it is a gbp500 budget limit and lelit anna ha three version this wa the cheapest i think more ideal would be the lelit anna pl41tem which ha a commercial articulated steam wand and a pid for 418euro gbp382 check it out speaking of value for money purchase under gbp500 there is a choice of a combined machine with a stepless conical grinder called lelit anita you can have it with pid and commercial steam wand for 515euro gbp471 or a budget version without pid with only 463euro gbp423 it is a nice combo for someone who gbp500 budget is a painful stretch,got a dedica a a first espresso machine in a tiny flat and have a few pointer to add the machine is largely automated but that mean it is also programmable temperate can be tweaked to low medium or high i am unclear on what temperature those actually map to you can set how hard the water you are using is shot length single or double can also be modified simply by holding down the button you also get a little warning light when the machine need a de scaling the wand is not great but a little angling doe help improve the froth that being said others have pointed out the ziptie mod a well a the option to install a silvia wand though that is more involved pressurised basket are not the best by any mean have not tried the mod james suggests but others have outright sawn off part of the basket and used a proper basket for pretty nice result i would say it is a good starter machine especially in a small space with plenty of room for modification and tweaking managed to get a refurbished unit for gbp90 so well worth the price,i have had a dedica since 2014 got it a a present and back then it wa around gbp150 i do not like waste so i have been saying i will upgrade when it break but erm it still going i have literally used it every morning and more often than not mid morning a well a when we have visitor apart from when i am away on holiday i would say something like 500 to 600 shot a year so at a machine cost of gbp25 a year and it done over 3000 shot i am blown away with the value i have added obviously the better unpressurised basket a water filter in the tank delonghi do one that fit and fitted a rancillio steam wand for better texture easy mod in your review your absolutely spot on with all of it misgiving i tend to have medium roast and it absolutely fine not amazing but adequate give it a light roast and it just say no i also tend to have a flat white out of it and not really neat espresso so it work perfectly to need and importantly my skill set patience edit of course you know this but to anyone reading that doe not the dediuca work well enough but only if you spend most of your budget on a good grinder,update to this watched james video on portafilter basket and purchased a higher quality item and now work with a lot lighter roast now,domestic steam valve is the name of my new jam band,i wa so waiting for this also thanks for considering availability,hey james in regard to steaming milk on the gaggia classic i suffer from the same issue a very underpowered steaming pressure and my heat indicator light turn off midway through the steaming process i highly recommend checking out this video it show the right way to get amazing steam pressure from this machine,eagle 1 patron giveaway when,thank you for doing this i would have liked to see these compared to the 9barista which seem in another league but for someone trying to have good expresso and doe not mind spending some time it seems another good option around the same price well a bit cheaper even also could you add link to the basket you have used,doe anyone have a link for the different basket he used for the gaggia classic,what made my decision of the silvia over the classic wa not wanting an aluminum tank id rather not have to risk the tank degrading over time or have to worry about replacing it down the line,james this wa informative and straight to the point review i like how you outlined both strength and weakness i suspect that most of your follower are somewhere in this range of price,hmmm i have been waiting for this video i previously thought i wa going to get this gaggia but i am not super sold on having to modify a machine so i am wondering if i should increase my budget and save up a bit more for something at a higher price point,following this comment because i am also interested i do not want to regret a buying decision,the rancillo still need that temp surfing to get a good shot when i had one over a decade ago this wa the issue with it seems like rancillo have done nothing to improve that issue since that doe not sound right a technology ha improved a lot since then,james review are really in depth and impressive such fine detail confidence in his thought and very honest another great video definitely go to show to value of a great espresso machine,i wish i could have a rancilio one day still doin doin fine with my 10 year old second hand gaggia evolution the only think i like about gaggia is the professional like portafilter,i am a fancy man yes you are james yes you are great review,so happy to see this review i have had a dedica for several year mainly to help me learn but also to avoid annoying my non espresso hobbyist husband i use it with a naked portafilter and it make some pretty acceptable espresso but yes they are a little cool for double shot i plugged the hole in the modified portafilter with a screw and nut i am looking to move eventually up to something better so this review wa illuminating a always i am hoping mr hoffman will make a single group eagle one so i can stop considering the anza,i had the silvia since last june but the learning curve is so hard especially if it is your first espresso machine you have to take her seriously or miss silvia will not be tolerated with you,this is a great video thank you please consider doing a video breaking down a typical espresso machine explaining showing the boiler the pump pressure valve etc and what to consider when purchasing maintaining and maybe modifying a product,i would love to see a video with your top 3 least expensive machine that make good espresso cappuccino without modding i am guessing they will be in the gbp900 1200 range such a the lelit mara x and elizabeth rocket appartamento and the profitec 300,i did not realise some basket are better what is a good basket for the rancillio,i had my siliva for 13 year never modded it with pid or similar but became an expert temperature surfer flushing the group head could not recommended that machine enough easy to clean and maintain easy to change gasket basically looked new the entire time it never broke down and actually got sold for about gbp150 and could probably have squeezed the price a bit more but wanted a quick deal amazed that it retained so much value on the second hand market that for me go to show why it would be my choice if i once again would want to get into the espresso hobby,audio of this video sound like it wa recorded in a cave on potato normally your video have superb quality,i wa just thinking about buying an espresso machine and what do i find another excellent hoffmann video on that subject thank you for making up my mind,the gaggia and rancillio are both excellent machine i would argue though that the gaggia make a bit more sense in this range of price both need modification to achieve great consistent result may a well spend le while doing it after modificatins in my opinion one is not superior to the other and gaggia cost le however i am in no way suggesting that the rancillio is not also excellent value for money bc it is great video a usual james,those cute face in the drip tray,i have owned a gaggia for 5 month now i have done both the pid and the opv mod i am using a rok grinder for some reason my shot are always fast but you are 100percent right about the learning process it is fun but daunting for many people,the delonghi dedica caused me great pain and sadness i could feel it slowly breaking down every time i would pull a shot after only 1 year it had turned into an inoperable hazard with an internal pipe splitting resulting in water being sprayed across the inside of the machine,thanks mr james i have been waiting to know your opinion on these machine for a while now and you delivered a usual i own the same rancilio silvia and yes the temperature issue is super annoying after many decade rancilio solved this by creating the pro version with pid temperature control which is way more expensive and at that price point there is more competition congrats on the eagle prima truly amazing,great comparison thanks i am waiting on delivery of my new gaggia classic and already have several mod planned the 9 bar opv spring will be first but i will now get a new basket a well the ability to tinker wa very appealing for me and the price wa only a little over half that of the silvia for me here in australia,wish you had included sage breville barista express 870xl a it very very popular,i have the bambino plus for three month now and have been disapointed with it inconsistancy to frothing i have played with the different froth level setting sometimes end up with no froth at the max setting that said i still like it user friendliness i plan to get three year of service from the bambino before loving up to a more prosumer machine like the rancilio you demoed thanks i enjoy all of your video,i have just recently gotten into coffee and after doing some initial research my choice landed on the sage bambino it ha the added value of taking le space in my kitchen with grinder the table top got a bit busy i absolutely love the machine and i share your opinion it is great little machine to start with and it ha feature that allows you to actually learn without having to get too deep into thing like modding my sage came with both pressurized and non pressurised basket so i did not have to buy anything it also come with a tamper pitcher for milk and a little dosing tool great value totally love it,i love your honest and balanced opinion james i have just invested in a bambino for gbp150 i thought i could not go far wrong for my first delve into home espresso i have twinned this with a rancilio rocky for gbp90 i am going to upgrade the basket a recommended,same here i did not want to drop the extra on a prosumer grade machine and bench space wa an issue and the bambino ha been excellent the auto milk capability is great and 3 sec warm up time i did toss the pressurised basket and bought their unpressurised one it worth the little they cost,cool video a always can you talk about the basket for the espresso machine i kinda do not understand the difference they make thanks,do you have a link for the scale that you use is it waterproof,great video i have the gaggia classic and will definitely pick up the vst basket i am by no mean a barista but can get a good shot out of it although a little inconsistent sometimes because a you pointed out the temp can vary i find if i let out until the temp light out and then catch it just a the light flick back on again i can get something close to consistent i have struggled with the milk and am looking to do a barista course to get my chop up,i have a gaggia classic pro a my first machine and i must say for me it is difficult to get the right texture of milk from the steam wand then again it could just be because i am a noob p,i use the gaggia classic pro and enjoy it quite well i think using a naked portafilter and a proper basket ha gone a long way swapped to the stainless block when i did a new shower screen to help with temp stability but definitely interested in the pressure switch mod also glad i am not the only one that find it a bit tough to get a good roll while steaming overall good value and i enjoy tinkering a well a developing my technique,a much a i enjoyed the review i am disappointed that you changed the stock basket by doing it that way you are not really reviewing the product a sold the shot you pulled are not the experience that someone using them straight from the box is going to get if they do not have spare part floating around yes i know there are many other variable involved water bean grind etc but hopefully you get my point,my first real espresso machine wa a silvia that i pid ed it wa very easy to do and i can highly recommend doing that if you want a silvia however i like a good cappuccino or flat white most of the time and so do many of my family member and friend and considering this a single boiler machine became very frustrating to me i am a little surprised that you did not touch on that in the video but then again there are no alternative in this budget range however to me if i wa shopping for a cheaper machine again i would not hesitate to add just a little extra and get a nuova simonelli oscar ii it is just so good value for the money,i have the sage bambino plus silver mostly metal and they sell them in germany at least with 4 basket so no extra money for that anyway milk steaming make me crazy the steam wand is so strong and my milk get hot so fast without becoming silky like yours i watched many video but it still hit or miss otherwise i am happy with the machine using the sage grindr and playing with bean and grind size thx for the video always a delight,sage is called breville in u,i use the silvia now it is my first machine had a steep learning curve but would not trade for anything else,can you share some replacement basket for those machine,what filter did you use in the delongi,i wa torn between the gaggia and the rancilio for some time now thanks for clearing that up not but joke aside great and helpful video a always,the lelit anna with the pid ha better button and is also under gbp500 would have been good to see that picked instead a it is the most popular model the pid is surprisingly honest,rancilio silvia owner here first year i used it a it were then i modified the temperature control not with pid however just electronic controlled relay thermostat way better control with only 0 1 hysteresis now the temp swing is around 5 total original thermostat have a hysteresis of about 3 but due to the small boiler the temp usually rise additional 7 10 a james proved often reaching 105 108 and also dropping to 93 i use a naked portafilter with vst basket the rancilio seems to have a longer deeper head so depending on roast coffee bean you could end up having trouble getting in your all of your 18g because shower screen and or set screw will touch your puck i have played around with different brew pressure and feel it is easier for a beginner to get more consistent result with lower pressure than 9 bar next step will be adding a pressure gauge great video a always james and yes the sound quality is usually better but you are excused,james your channel ha fundamentally changed my life i am a confirmed tea consumer eastern style high quality tea only now however i am an occasional coffe taster because you have helped me to find a new hobby we have purchased a lelit anna with a pid i learned a lot from your video and now every morning i make delicious espresso for my wife who is very satisfied with the result and she is a barista you sir made that happen thank you,love watching your vids what i find interesting is how really nothing make good coffee or at least anything consumer focused you need to spend hundred and hundred on a grinder and on scale and even gbp500 machine do not really make that good a coffee and these are shot made by you who really know his stuff basically it seems like i just buy good instant coffee which is super consistent for home and support my local coffee shop when i want something nice,have no interest in buying a new espresso machine yet wa really excited to see this upload and enjoyed watching it fwiw i have a rocket r58 which is a good few year old now and the pid ha given up the ghost need a new one a i learnt from this video that my inconsistency with shot could be wandering temperature and i have no idea what it brewing at always learning,this wa the perfect video great price range to get a feel for and it always fun watching james get wired for u not so fancy folk of youtube,how about feratti ferro it is common in indonesia for cafe who is in budget,ah indonesia home of the kopi susu the most delicious coffee drink i have ever tasted stayed in sumatra for something like 3 month absolute heaven,what basket do you buy for the bambino plus am not overly familiar with basket etc and do not want to buy the wrong size one that doe not fit,i do not understand the part about replacing the standard basket with a different one can you make a video about this specific topic i would like to understand what a standard pressurized basket is versus the one that you are switching to for supposedly better shot,nice to see a rancilio on this channel i am friend with the owner his son wa a class mate of mine in primary and secondary school no one care but seeing a rancilio on youtube is interesting to me,i have a bambino and overall i enjoy it but i have been eyeing the gaggia to get more flexibility in term of modding and a 58mm portafilter i do not really have complaint with the bambino i enjoy the shot i can pull from it a a novice intermediate user i think however the ceiling for what i can get out of it is lower than it would be with the gaggia or another machine all that said loved the video,i feel like lelit is the right mix here for me without significan not mod it get all the basic right if it hold temp at this price what could be better,58mm portafilter our old saeco wa very narrow 51mm and made it harder to try out different tamper and get a naked portafilter,lelit water level window not that good chuckle in rocket appartamento,ikr we have to open the top to check xd,fine test great channel but when i come tired home i am never anymore gon na use a manual espresso machine i will have a fully auto machine with water filter incl milk system press a button and i have my cup and no cleaning and no mess what so ever and it quick bean to cup one button test needed delonghi sage saeco siemens philip etc my old fashion 90 is krups prego is still going strong but i hate the mess and work time for a full auto machine here in 2021 soon,been using a 2nd hand gaggia classic 150eur for 5 year now it is better than i am for sure i lowered the pressure turn a screw and sometimes get great espresso the fact you can maintain a machine that is built to last is great do not care about milk thanks for the perfect click with the basket james highly appreciated jan,love the 0 0 face on de longhi is drip tray,missing both the la pavoni europiccola and the quickmill 820 but nonetheless a great comparison a always,my niche grind for my silvia at about 10 holy calibration batman,can you get the cc1 in uk that is a solid pick under or around 500pounds,read my mind im newly in the market for a machine to the coffee community anyone know where i can look for a used la pavoni in the u the price for a new europiccola is slightly out of range,the rancilio wa my first and only espresso machine i have had it for 6 year if one is jumping into espresso there is is a learning curve with this machine that wa in my case quite frustrating i would do the same thing twice and get very different result learning how to temperature surf solved a lot of the problem then a new grinder and finally a scale now at least i could track parameter and my espresso ha become quite enjoyable to me i am not barista capable but i enjoy the machine would i do it again yes though i have become a bit ocd the journey ha been wonderful experience thank you for your youtube channel i have learned a lot here respectfully pt,what a pity the la pavoni el europiccola gbp445 wa not included it would be great to compare it to the line up please test the rancilio silva v the pavoni before giving it away,wa really considering the rancilio silvia since i work from home now the modding aspect kind of turn me off now,i am a fancy man well he owns it i guess,ty for the review i will buy the delonghi dedica tommorow i am one of those people that are budget restricted,i bought gaggia because it way cheaper then silvia i bought mine for le then 300 pound new with warranty portafilter is bad but the size make the difference steaming is a pain wish u did it a year a go when i wa in the market lelit ha also anna with pid factory installed it in the range of 500 pound,completely agree with your conclusion james i started on a gaggia classic early 2000s model and it wa great but lacked steam power needed the opv mod to bring the pressure down portafilter is crap so got a bottomless and a vst basket got a 3d printed drip tray that is skinnier to give more space under the portafilter ims shower screen but it really excelled with a pid all in i honestly probably spent gbp200 odd extra on part for a machine i picked up for gbp100 on ebay i really can not fathom why they made the new classic pro still to have what 15 bar of pressure and a pressurised basket leave that to a cheap delonghi people spending gbp400 on a machine either want it to perform like a prosumer machine or they want a bean to cup not these weird half way machine i think the new machine just miss out on securing a potentially massive audience because they have targeted it wrong i am not on a lelit but a marax i absolutely love it their higher end machine though all come with 58mm portafilters i can not for the life of me work out why they would not apply this across the board why limit the tamper portafilter basket shower screen gasket etc that you can buy it doe not make any sense basically there is a fair few good machine here but they are all stuck in a limbo for me in between being a gimmicky toy aimed at newcomer with low budget and prosumer machine that offer so much more,would love to see one of these for bean to cup superautomatics which machine make the best coffee when james skill and experience is not really a factor not necessarily for personal use but when kitting out a small office kitchen or whatever it would be quite nice to know the best option,great video i own the delonghi and the best part about it is the small footprint and simplicity of use i wa a barista like 10 year ago and i do wish it had a real steam wand and portafilter but for the money i have been happy with the machine for sure,i got the delonghi dedica because it wa the only nicer machine in my price point and i have been pretty disappointed with it i used to have the cheaper delonghi model which yielded crema every time but i just can not seem to get good espresso out of this one i am saving up for a nicer machine and hope to resell this one in the process but i would recommend sticking with the cheaper delonghi a moka pot for espresso and saving for a nicer machine rather than spending money on this one,still playing around with it have not found what work yet what do you use,try a different roast or a grind setting my dedica always give me ample crema,please make a vid for best machine from dollar500 dollar1000,you should have looked for lelit glenda instead which using 58mm portafilter also in lelit you can do pressure profiling while other they do not even have pressure gauge,out of curiosity ha anyone gotten ad for the phin reusable metal filter coffee maker i love the idea of sustainability but i want to hear other people is take if they have had it,a phin is just the name for the type of coffee maker used for vietnamese coffee i have one and i have generally enjoyed it but i end up having to use a lot of coffee to get my desired strength they are pretty sustainable since there is no external filter and they are also super cheap to buy i think mine wa 6euros i prefer my moka pot at home but the compactness of the phin make it way easy to travel with if i went camping i would probably take it with me,where could i buy a normal 54mil basket for delongio,oh boy already know this is going to be good,me doe not make espresso at home and ha no intention to also me watch the entire video all the way through,there is a simple trick on the gaggia classic pro that will let you steam milk for day search for tmb channel on yt for a tutorial i can confirm that it work it is just silly that gaggia did not implement it from the factory btw the machine is otherwise pretty good,thank you james you have just convinced me to mod my silvia,for people interessed in machine like these i would recommend looking into the quickmill series a well if it is available to you 0820 in particular or the 3000 which is the same in a full metal enclosure plus a pressure gauge,i bought my silvia about 4 year ago and it is been an absolute blast to use it is a bullet proof machine i agree with all the point james raised temperature surfing is a must and a my first ever machine it took me a while before i wa steaming milk well that said i love it,rat i have been waiting for a video like this there go my bank balance again lol thanks james,i love my gaggia classic have a model from 2007 and have changed the steam wand so it is effectively a pro my advice would be to get one second hand you can fairly easily get one for gbp100ish and clean it up mod it for a little bit more to get it up to scratch,true that,terrific review i have had my eye on the rancilio for a while and i think this is really gon na help me decide whether or not to pull that trigger thank you for your hard work,i love my gaggia classic pro which i have been using for about a year refilling the water tank is very easy two option and wa one of the main selling point for me i have no problem steaming milk the most irritating thing about it is the leaky steam wand which drip water after a few month of use evidently this is a common problem there is a mod out there to fix it but it involves removing the steam valve and permanently removing a protective collar so it can be disassembled and cleaned without the protective collar you could scald yourself because there is nothing preventing you from overturning the steam control and having the core of the valve followed by steam come out in your hand this video show the mod i am talking about,there are some precision basket for lelit 57 mm like ascaso precision up to 18 20 gr and ims up to 16 gr quite good,is the jump in quality from the stock filter worth it i see bluestarcoffee sell a 14gr filter i bought a filter set from amazon and did not notice a difference,starting from the 11 00 mark of this video it describes how to increase the steaming power of the gaggia,my sage bambino plus came with 4 portafilter basket single wall single cup single wall double cup dual wall single cup and dual wall double cup,ian armour well basically at the hot temperature you can shove your finger in my cup of espresso not good at all and nearly gbp350 not at all happy and ao arguing with smeg had i bought from amazon i could have immediately sent it back but ao were gbp55 cheaper so swung it bitterly regret it say if you use item ie switch it on you are only entitled to 50percent back shocking,tricia carol kilbride define hot boiling scolding i am assuming lukewarm is le than body temp,hi there can you tell me whether it make a really hot cup of espresso a i like mine hot bought a smeg and it lukewarm and not to my liking at all thanks x,i did not like the part where you changed the basket but i understand,lelit is are awesome and underrepresented quality italian machine i have got a victoria which ha pid and 58mm head the thing make wonderful espresso,aw i wa hoping a la pavoni would make it into this review did you avoid it because of how manual for want of a better word it is or wa there something else,nice review thanks,believe it or not the de longhi ha adjustable temperature no value given other then low medium and high and stock is medium even high is under 90c from my experience so it need to be set to high 1st thing out of the box for sure if you have not adjusted this it is at under 80 c i see a gaggia classic in my future tho,do a blind test let see if james can match the shot to the correct machine blinded d,here is the question james i already bought cafelat robot but i had really struggling time to choose between semi auto machine or manuel what is your opinion i know you are one that will truthfully answer it,james i love the effort you put to be honest when creating your content it is a relief to watch a video in which the reviewer is not trying to sell you something,i have owned the lelit bianca for about a year and i remain impressed with the quality of the machine and the espresso it make,is it wrong to admit that i am getting a man crush for james fyi just tried the la bolsa from square mile absolutely fantastic now i have to decide if i try a different blend from square mile or stick with la bolsa damm look like i will be ordering both anyone got any suggestion,when i heard of the pressurised basket pleb i judge every machine like i could afford any of them even though i only drink espresso because i work at a coffee shop still will always treat the simonelli at work like it is my baby,i still use my superautomatic machine because nobody else would know how to pour a shot so i would have to have 2 machine on my counter at all time hahaha,you say the espresso taste harsh from too high water temperature but a i have understood it you do not think pour over will be effected badly by high water temperature is it because the water is traveling longer before it hit the coffee with pour over or have i just misunderstood something a always great video,amazing content per usual james just curious why no 4k,i have an older version of the gaggia completely agree re your observation can also take some time to get back to temperature if making more than one milk drink,i used to have the dedica bench space wa limited so a no brainer upgrading the basket is necessary you can also trim the black plastic insert so you can fit it and a basket upgraded to a silvia now the temp surf is real can be a bit annoying having to wait for the boiler to come up to temp to steam milk not so great for making multiple drink also there is a nut that hold the shower screen in which can damage your puck if not careful otherwise a great machine i am sure in a few year when i can justify the price tag i will upgrade again to a rocket appartamento or the like,could you post which basket you used,i am curious a to why you switched out the pressurized basket for non pressurized i have been running a delonghi dedica for about a year and i am thinking about this modification but i am unsure where to start i have heard that it is an odd sized basket 51mm but i am not sure where to find a vst or other regular basket to fit that taking the cover off the end of the steam wand help to get a more consistent milk texture and temperature,very good video i myself have a machine around the 500 euro price mark i run through all those machine bar the sage i have to highlight that the newer lelit model look very interesting if you make a 750 or 1000 euro run please consider including the grace or the victoria,excellent been waiting for this one to drop thanks so much,curious on this say v the 9barista other manual machine,i started with delonghi dedica i found non pressurized basket for it and actually paired with rancilio rocky grinder if you did not ask too much like 10 espresso shot in 5 minute which we did quite often it provided perfectly oily creamy espresso i did not cut the portafilter though to make it bottomless that would be interesting then moved to gaggia classic pro and i bought bottomless straight away and wow much better perfect espresso totally possible my friend ha rancilio silvia just tuned up with pid electric v bimetal thermostat and it is a beast but still i think next big improvement over gaggia would have to be some hx machine or at least some rotary pump,back up the digger for a minute i have a delonghi and am constantly seeing the grind size for a machine is fine but when i try it in my machine it just dy and have to make the grind more corse i assumed it wa because of a weak pump but is it possible that it is the stock filter,james you should make a video on basket or way to upgrade an espresso machine,i have a breville bambino and so far i absolutely love it i am not ready to spend over a dollar1000 on a machine but i am sure one day i will get there i think it is a great beginner machine,because i am a fancy man,can you do the sage barista express at some point pretty please,hi james thanks for this review it wa the one i wa waiting hoping for with the sage bambino is there a portafilter basket you could recommend please,phil griffith thanks phil,james posted in an earlier reply that he used the sage breville unpressurised 54mm basket these can be ordered direct from them via their website when they have stock e g,now do bdb appartamento oscar 2,a real pleasure to steam with james bradbury hoffman,i recently bought a 2001 gaggia classic and so far so good a with the new machine the temp can vary depending on your routine upgraded the steam wand so is far better now for making textured milk the issue i find from a personal perspective is shot speed can quickly change depending on the tamp the temp etc,i bought a 2nd hand original gaggia classic opv tweaked to 10 bar only an allen key and pressure gauge needed 18g vst basket steam issue can be worked around by starting to steam before the thermostat reach temp that way it keep the heater element on otherwise a soon a the stat kick in it loos all power not felt the need for a pid yet a slight flush before pulling a shot and i very rarely get a drink i am not happy with all in gbp180 and about 20 minute work,with the rancilio they have pid which can do both temp and pre infusion also i am not sure on how practical or effective this is but i have heard that with the stock silvia you can open the steam valve while pulling a shot to relieve pressure in the espresso which kind of get a pre infusion and then once you have pre infused for your desired time you close the valve which ramp up the pressure again,i wa tremendously lucky because my first espresso machine wa a silvia that i bought lightly used for 60 buck including a tamper knockbox descaling supply the guy i bought it from wa selling it for his kid and had no idea how good a value he wa providing one of the thing that i really like about espresso machine in this price range is that the build quality can be good enough that they can be sold resold assuming proper maintenance and potentially give people an affordable way to make really good espresso when the temperature cooperates,i have the dedica and it is made from brushed aluminum did they change it in recent year,thanks for this video not seen it yet but the video i have been waiting for i am getting into the espresso life,using the rancilio silvia for about a year now i can only agree to the review i regretted having it bought the first week but once i learned how to heat it up i would not trade it for another one,i am edging toward a sage breville only because my household would be using the machine not just me seems you can be fancy and efficient with the machine without being a guru barista,the breville sage machine i have bought have never let me down they are really good,a a bambino owner lem me just say the teaspoon are always out and the pinky are always up,silvia gang rise up,the silvia is such a widely used machine a video on the best mod would be super cool,now i am curious if you would like the new silvia pro doe that machine answer your concern with the plain silvia,daaamn my silvia in a test by jaaames my lady ftw,thanks mate really appreciate the video finally someone that i believe in his knowledge and skill did this review,breville infuser feel like that wa a great option for this review rather then the bambino awesome video though thanks for another great one,did not know about the duo bummer to lose the infuser but the duo seems to be pretty good,i used to own the infuser wa a machine that performed pretty well i would say it wa more like the precursor to the bambino because it shared a lot of similar feature e g preinfusion pid programmable volumetric control the duo temp pro is basically the infuser without the volumetric button i e it is fully manual one thing i appreciated about the infuser wa it had single walled basket,i would love to know too it seems like the infuser is being discontinued from the few store i have talked with replaced with the le impressive duo temp,i have had the classic pro for about 4 month and once i nodded it for 9 bar the shot started tasting much better and i can count on one hand the number of bad shot i have pulled since then i wa worried getting the spring mod wa a waste of money i could not have been more wrong,i will say that having a pid is a game changer i have a 2015 gaggia classic with pid brew pressure gauge and modded opv to be around 10 bar the pid can be set for your brew and steam temperature you can set higher temp got light roast lower for darker roast and higher to increase the steam pressure it fix most of complaint james had for the gaggia and silvia,oooo so if the person that win it on your patron want you to install the mod you talked about before you send it to them you really should do a video of tinkering fun noting to technical no step by step unless ya want to but it always cool to see inside the machine,you forgot the thermal block series from quickmill 0820 2820 small maschines but so far it s been really enjoyable to make some solid espresso with it also little space between group head and driptray but the perfekt solution for beginner or people with small kitchen,i am not quite in the market yet but i have been thinking about home espresso for a while i love espresso but i can never decide if i want to bring work into my kitchen or feel like i am knowing that there is a good modding community for the rancilio and the gaggia really narrow it down a far a budget and effort,i love coffee but am not prepared to get into weight and scale i have the dedica took me a week or two of trial and error with grind size and amount produced but i now get cup after cup of delicious coffee just the way i like it my first cup of coffee is made a soon a i get out of bed still half asleep from start to finish for a good mug of coffee it take maybe three minute of brain free operation not saying the dedica is the one you should go for not saying that at all but once you have your recipe system to your liking it will become second nature and not work at all,looking forward for best espresso machine under 1000,that satisfying snap of the portafilter at 12 09,no lever machine,i have the gaggia classic pro added a pid kit trimmed the opv spring to reduce the pressure and it now pull great shot the pid also improved the steaming feature there are also low profile drip tray being 3d printed that allow using a scale while brewing,joseph hobbs i am hoping to do the same mod is there a site or forum where i can find out what to do,i would love to see how the rancilio is up against a breville or sage in the uk barista express or other sage machine coming from working in specialty coffee for year the rancilio seems like a really great option,i used to have a delonghi dedica a my first coffee machine a a hobbyist i made a few adjustment one being buying a bottomless portafilter and a standard basket like james did and it wa a lot of fun to play with you can also fit a silvia steam wand on it but it would take a couple of hour and some level of electrician knowledge which i do not have another trick only work on model ec685 will not work on ec680 is to remove the steam wand sleeve and use a zip tie to hold the plastic inner tube in place to steam milk which can let you control milk texture better since it will not inject air for you i later sold the dedica and bought a 2003 gaggia classic which wa a lot of fun to learn how to make espresso too this time around it is much easier to fit a silvia steam wand on the gaggia since the older model come with a plastic pannarello wand making espresso on the gaggia is more enjoyable to do it on the dedica but i can feel the frustration of the lack of steam power on the gaggia and i wa genuinely shock when i later sold it and bought an expobar home pulser the pulser being a hx machine can put out a crazily strong steaming power which took me quite a while to get used to,this would be intimidating this would be tricky this would make a mess a whole bunch of time before i got my milk texturing down wow shot fired that wa exactly my experience with my silvia a my first espresso machine i have still not figured out how to properly steam milk to make latte art mine never seems to paint for lack of a better word but at least i can avoid making a mess i am glad i splurged for a pid installed silvia based on this vid though i probably spent too much buying one with a pre installed pid but i really did not want to mess with potentially messing up an expensive espresso machine,i am a complete idiot and not a tinkerer and it only took me a couple of hour to get my pid installed i recommend the mecoffee because the silvia just look dang good and i would hate to have visible screw ons same with the milk though,just got a rancillio a few month ago and relieved to be justified in my purchase i have been enjoying it so far though the inconvenience of a single boiler quickly showed but for the price i am willing to work through it once you develop a routine i feel like you can get pretty consistent brew temp i find letting it run through several heating cycle eliminates much of the flash boiling when i make mistake to me the espresso is still tolerable,did not expect that case for the spoon that is really fancy i want one,how many shot did you drink to film this 0,i bought the sage breville for the exact reason you gave after seeing your sage oracle review i do not want a new hobby a you would put it but could not justify the cost of the oracle what basket did you get for it,any chance of a vid focussing on decaf a a caffeine sensitive person who love the ritual and taste of coffee how do i get the best out it are there constraint relative to brewing method do some type of bean make better decaf are there any sustainability or ethical issue etc,absolutely love your take i really want a real espresso machine for the house but something about using those stupid nespresso pod get me,greg mark a ochoa sorry for the belated reply to both of you but what are you guy saying that in your respective country the nespresso pod are not recyclable where i live you can bring back your used pod to the nespresso boutique put them with the recycling bin along with other recyclables paper can etc or even mail them to a designated recycling facility the pod aluminium is recycled and the coffee ground are composted this wa the biggest reason for me along with the taste to choose this system instead of the keurig or worse the tassimo system,meyersfarber first of all the pod are aluminum not plastic and the reason ground coffee go stale is because of contact with air the coffee in the pod are sealed airtight now nespresso is far from great and it is not like i want to defend them but overexaggerating is a thing too,underdog rising i started farming my own bean quality is through the roof in comparison and it is far cheaper,mark a ochoa nespresso waste le coffee and le water though thereby saving another kind of wastage and for the unskilled they provide a consistency of reasonably drinkable shot that they could probably never produce with normal setup,any pod coffee taste watered down,being a owner of gaggia classic pro i 100percent agree with all your point and criticism,i seriously just signed in i hate g with a passion to up vote this i have been wondering if you were going to do this video great timing a my bdb is toast after 10 year and i am trying to convince myself to spend more than i have i e not one in this range,i ordered a dedica and received it yesterday my end goal is to build my own espresso machine but first i wanted to order a budget machine at a discount price it wa only dollar150 on ebay and make modification to it to both learn how the machine work and get some hand on experience i have a much higher quality non pressurized basket on the way i plan on making the portafilter bottomless and i wan na conver the heating system to boiler so i have more control over the water temperature and hopefully i can upgrade the pump to something with a more customizable brew time in it present state it is really only good for mediocre milk drink and e s e,next time machine between 500 and 1000,in my opinion sage is the perfect machine for people who want to transition from nespresso machine after they realize you can get better coffe for le money per shot it is the equivalend of bose for audio it get close to pro level not with quality but with trick,before having finished watching the full review i own the lelit anna with a pid and i am in love so far but i also am worried about the drip tray constantly d,i would love to see a video in the price range up to 1500 then you have interesting choice to make you are on the bottom class of a dual boiler or wouldecent hx machine e61 group or for example bezerra specific group pid yes no etc rotary v vibration pump atleast my upgrade would probably cost over euros1k because in between the rancilla and the 1k budget there is not much in the market that is worth the money imo james might surprise me though he always come up with his own view on certain aspect of the coffee making process,intensivecarebears i agree with your point gbp1500,quick tip for delonghi dedica buy proper basket with portafilter on aliexpress 12 dollar and super important before making coffee heat the machine up by running it twice without portafilter hit espresso button two time the coffee taste noticeably better when machine is heated this way,i run it without coffee but with portafilter so that also the portafilter becomes hot like the machine,neodrumz dr lloyd bass i got this one and i also picked up the delonghi 51mm tamper they work perfectly together,sangurucho 51mm,would you tell me the diameter of the basket for this machine,good tip,thanks for the video james i recently upgraded from the bambino plus to the silvia and the thing i had noticed the bambino wa very very finnicky to dial in it required coffee to be ground uncomfortably coarse and the result with very lightly roasted melbourne coffee wa subpar i also found that it could not maintain 9 bar of pressure consistently and led to many very frustrating brew the silvia is a tinkerer is dream built like a tank like you said i do not mind temperature surfing or the fact that it is a single boiler after a while flushing surfing becomes part of your routine in the same way that pre heating the portafilter doe one last thing is that sage product at least in australia a breville very often go on sale accordingly the bambino plus is placed at a very similar price point to that of the delonghi in australia check ozbargin for deal it often go for dollar350 aud 196 gbp at that price point it is significan notly cheaper than the silvia or gaggia and for someone who similar to me want to investigate if they want to adopt a pet called an espresso machine it is a strong recommendation however for someone who know espresso know what is involved in making it at home i would steer clear away from the bambino plus if possible while it can make decent espresso it can not really make great espresso and you will waste of much coffee trying to get to great espresso that it will not be worth it not a joy to use and not worth the hassle,i can echo this about the bambino i feel like i am consistently chasing a decent shot it is quite frustrating however i managed to pick one up for dollar330 when it wa on sale it made it a big selling point prior to going to a machine twice the price,hi james could u do a comparison video on vst v ims,curious if you can control preinfusion on any of the machine that required coarser grind i have a flair and a you know it is a much smaller basket that typically requires a coarser grind because of the deeper puck but the trick for them is to go ahead and grind finer anyways and do a longer preinfusion and also end up with a longer total shot time in the 45 60 second area just curious if something like the bambino for instance can control preinfusion enough to make it work for light roast also maybe i missed it but are some of these machine getting a more in depth video that includes mod i almost thought you would cover it at the end of the video but i know it wa running a bit long,can you do a video about modifying the gaggia classic pro i am really interested in improving the machine despite voiding the warranty,you can change the brew temp on the dedica it is in the instruction booklet,had a dedica for about 3 year now i definitely did not know what i wa doing when i got it i probably still do not now i am now all too aware of it shortfall but gbp400 500 wa a very intimidating price at that point for me have to say it done me really well i am looking forward to an upgrade down the line but i will look back on it with fondness having had it in a small kitchen i definitely think the small form factor is a selling point for a lot of people,pri vor just brought a severin km 3874 and the coffee of my delongi improved significan notly even when using pressurized basket and the std setup,pri vor i have not researched for a new one yet but the cheapest will be manual james ha a video on that maybe he also ha a video on where to go after that,diogo santos what is a good budget grinder,we have got one too price and size we are a big factor in making the decision especially a i wa fairly clueless to the finer point of coffee making while i would like the machine to be more sturdy i enjoy the coffee it produce and it fit in our tiny kitchen,tmdub88 agreed my next purchase is more likely to be a grinder than an upgrade to my dedica whilst being a budget decision i still get better expressos at home than 90percent of the coffee that i am finding here in random caffes in london,i am very glad that gagia remade the classic with a solenoid valve again i went out of my way to hunt down an old gaggia from the 90 i think restored it and modded it and i love it to this day but i really like that it is now possibly again to get a proper gaggia classic brand new,i have entered the world of espresso a couple of month ago with the sage bambino plus what i am most frustrated with is the portafilter a the delonghi it contains a plastic piece that guide the liquid after the extraction which seems to mess with the espresso flow i can not wait for the sage naked portafilter to be released in europe to test it and see if there is a difference do you think that changing the non pressurized basket would make a difference,french flyboy hard to say because i switched to unpressurized basket about the same time i switched portafilters there wa a definite difference between the two basket style and using an unpressurized basket with the modded portafilter seemed better the few shot i pulled before switching portafilters,mike occhuizzo thanks mike did you notice any change in a good way when switching portafilters,french flyboy not sure of the shipping cost but crema coffee in the u make a really nice 54mm bottomless portafilter that i use with my bambino also there are video around here with instruction on how to pop out the plastic insert on the original bambino portafilter taking it out supposedly doe not have a negative impact on pulling a shot and you can pop it back in if you wanted,i know it,i have a silvia and i wa a complete novice when i bought it a year later i think i can pull a decent shot though it still seems i am learning but what i like is the built what about the size of the portafilter doe that not matter in the quality of your espresso,money on the table ready to buy whatever james say is best and ready to throw out gaggia classic pro if he say it is crap,do not throw it out it is a great machine add a pid get a 9 bar spring cheap from shade of coffee get precision basket and shower head you will get great espresso,i have the rancilio but not the vst basket so i have to give that a try is the 18g the one you would recommend great video a always james thanks,he is spot on my rancilio is built like an army tank i bought it 7 year ago refurbished from whole latte love with a new rocky grinder both have worked like a charm nothing ha broken all still plodding along just fine for my level i pull one shot a day why do i need more all of those look like they could work for a first machine,lindysellshomes i am almost the same bought a used machine 5 year ago with a new rocky and they have been rock solid temp surfing is not a big deal once you learn how to manage the temp it is no extra hassle i agree with james on the steam pressure i have blown the milk clean out of the jug a couple time when i wa learning how to steam,could you imagine the amount of caffeine this guy ha consumed in his life,probably pretty standard amount a regular people could consume quite a lot with mediocre coffee energy drink coke and tea brewing speciality coffee doe not have to change much,guess to the closest mg,fun fact they shot this video on a high speed camera and ran it at a tenth of the speed,there is actually some blood in his caffeine stream,that is why he went grey age 15,so excited for this literally have been looking for something in this range perfect timing thank you,i have the lelit anna pl41tem and this machine come with a pid controll for 400euros you should tested this model of the anna it is far more competitive,a a gaggia classic owner the milk pressure issue is much improved if you begin to steam before the temperature light come on if you wait until the steam is to temp it run out of puff before the heating element kick back in start to steam while it is still heating and the result are much better,only watching this to see what james ha to say about my delonghi o,al201103 same after viewing this i plan on changing the portafilter basket though,al201103 chance are we do not like the same sorta espresso a thus guy,haha i wa the same lot of comment here from people who are quite happy with theirs a i am maybe we have lower expectation every day i am delighted with my home coffee so i am sticking with mine,i feel like it is a bit unfair to put lelit rancilio and gaggia machine along side with delonghi and breville the build quality of those three that are made in italy is far superior than the latter two,thank you next 800dollar machine lol,i own the silvia for the past 8 year and the brew temp is the biggest problem but once you get used to temp surfing you solve this problem,i bought and returned the dedica i also removed the plastic insert from the portafilter to use an unpressurised basket but blocked the extra hole by finding a small bolt of the right size and cutting it down however i still could not get satisfactory result and it wa just too inconsistent but in retrospect that could have been down to an issue with my one and possibly that the basket wa not great form size for a small kitchen is very good though not really a milky drink person so can not comment on steaming if space and budget are limited it is not bad but would quickly become frustrating if you are on a learning curve now have a la pavoni so espresso is way more frustrating and fun,thanks for this i am literally about to make this purchase and then the video came out,what is the best basket for a rancilio i have been using the stock one for year doe ridged v ridge le matter,i use a ridgeless 18g vst easier to remove from portafilter than ridged,a patreon supporter do we need to enter somewhere for the giveaway or we are automatically entered,rancilio just came out with a dual boiler silvia that ha pid and everything built in they are taking pre order for it now,it cost over gbp500 more tho should do a comparison with sage dual boiler and rocket,coffee machine price never make much sense i paid le than the bambino price for my barista express brand new whilst the grinder is not the best it pretty decent for the gbp389 and a good starting place until i upgraded in a few year time also i really appreciate the fact that sage breville machine have easy to order part and spare i really like when i spend a lot of money that i can replace the little bit in case they break with time also my barista express amp my brother is bambino both came with both standard and pressurised basket so i wonder if they have limited this now,a superb and brief group reveiw simply leaf the others behind the comparison on brew temp and brew pressure are spot on and ditto their steaming power bravo,hi james i own the dedica exactly the same colour a well it wa right at the top of my budget my wife and i are very happy with it we only drink latte and i have found the steam wand to be more than up to the job i use a grinder that only cost gbp80 and on it is finest setting is perfect for this machine i do still use the pressurised basket though i will share this info with you a long a you do not tell me off this wa an upgrade from the amazon basic model which still made nice tasting latte the dedica is in a different league though a always thanks for a well presented informative video,guess my comment wa heard lol,i have a rancilio at home and a modified dedica at work and hand down rancilio you need to learn a few trick but after that the espresso is amazing,are those niche grind setting with a nfc niche they seem very coarse for my gaggia baby class which should not be that far from the classic pro albeit with a pressure mod and a higher quality basket i grind at 14 5 on the niche,i have had a lelit the one with double boiler of about 500 600 gbp cost before moving to the uk it wa great it is still working well our friend own it now and i miss it a lot with separate boiler for steam and coffee i wa able to serve like 4 cup of cappuccino in 5 minute working in a very parallelised manner quite recommend,is there some phasing issue with the audio i am getting dizzy,here i am watching james again tearing up over my instant cofffee and saving up to buy a dedica someday,phew the cafelat robot win again glad my upgraditis will not be triggered this wa about what i would spend on an espresso machine,very nice test james but why are you forcing so much gaggia to be better than it really is only nostalgy or sth else i am sorry but that conclusion is obvious after watching your video if you would take better lelit model for ex grace or glenda fitting the price range the classic would be blown away why lelit wa the only one with stock basket with vst it would be second choice after rancilio would not it but it could not why you have not mentioned anything about boiler in these machine and temperature stability during extraction is it because gaggia with it tiny aluminium boiler will be kicked off easily in comparison with lelit what this plasticky delonghi is doing nearby silvia is it taken because otherwise gaggia should take the last place especially if delonghi would be replaced with sth from ascaso water tank in lelit is not handy but tank in gaggia is really easy to take off really minus for you mate,fully agree with the review i have the bambino amp sage grinder it work well but it is a challenge to get the right result without going through ream of shot it is a machine my wife can manage and even my 14 year old if he make a coffee for his mom setting up is complex after that it great but there is room for tweak,one might argue by changing the basket the revue is comprised toward good or bad just a note,no quickmill 0820 weak,i have got the dedica and an older gaggia i find the review to be fair,allison pell oh no that is too much of a price jump i want to slowly work my way up to a machine like that a long a the difference is significan not enough that make it worth buying then i am happy but if it is just minor then yeah not worth it,futureallennl there wa an increase but not a huge a it could be bear in mind that i have not put a pid on it yet if you have the money for a dollar1000 machine then go for one of those instead,wa there a big increase in espresso quality when going form the dedica to the gaggia what i am basically asking is if it is worth the upgrade or if i should spend more for a better machine than the gaggia,i own one of the delonghi one serviceable little machine originally bought it for price and footprint i find it is quite touchy and temperamental and after seeing this video it may well be time to trade up for a sage or a gaggia,i personally own a 57mm lelit anita with stock presssure release valve better steam wand and pid and im very happy with it this is a really good and informative video a always but i would like to note that the lelit anna is also available with a 58mm portafilter for just under 500euros other version also with pid,for the extra coin would you say it is worth buying the new rancilio silvia pro that is come with a pid,where doe his table end,what kind of basket did you use on the rancilio silvia,i have had the gaggia classic for a couple month now and have not done any mod yet i find the steam ready light is not a very good indicator and i have seen it described online a the too late light i found a huge difference in my milk texture and steam power when i started steaming 20 second after flipping the steam switch rather than waiting for the light to go back on,dirk l i agree with the overdosing too i know it depends on the bean but i have had great result from dosing 20g into my 14g basket,you are on about the 20 power up and on the comment above on the change to a bottomless portafilter and vst or ims basket one mod i would suggest is the variation in your recipe to a higher gram in to make use of the higher pressure from the machine i find that 19 20g yield better result for transparency of tasting note when not using dark roast because of my time with the gaggia classic pro i think i am more ready to spend the extra cash for a machine that give me more ability to adjust these input ie brew temp brew pressure steam timing and consistency such a model from ecm rocket etc and of course grinder are important so do not skimp there at all fortunately for me i can get the same or better personal espresso quality taste and art from this machine than i get from the local coffee shop in town using their local roast i am on this journey so i am really enjoying the experience and of course this channel for the wisdom,also the simplest modification i made that resulted in the biggest improvement to my espresso wa switching out the pressurized basket i now use a bottomless portafilter with a vst basket,i am keen to try this i just switched out the steam wand to rancilio silvia on my 2014 gaggia classic and have been really disappointed with the result steam power tends to die halfway through and it doe not seem to be a problem with the thermostat or anything like that thanks for the tip,drain the water in the boiler before steaming it creates a larger steam head,you can get a new breville sage dual boiler previous generation for adollar1000 gbp560 would be awesome to have it compared to the device in this review,i have always loved your video and still do no change there but did the new setup change to audio quality to me it sound a bit like you use the build in mic in the camera especially the shot when you are furthest away from the camera slightly reminiscent og being in a cardboard box or a can this is unfortunate since your voice is so pleasant to listen to we are missing out,please review the anna espresso machine i am very interested in it,can you do something on nespresso machine,so the best espresso machine under 500 is a machine that is more than 500,nope i got mine for gbp499 due to the price going up and down lately,thanks for the review check on lelit marax and bianca machine you will get even more surprised,lelit is legit in the home espresso scene they tend to be value oriented and have some of the most affordable e61 machine on the market literally le polish than the competitor but pretty much the same internals until you start getting into the machine with more electronics most of the part of their bigger machine are standard industrially produced espresso machine component so they have good repairability if you are on a budget and want a trad stainless steel hx they are an excellent option,patrice meijboom my experience is with the bigger e61 type machine which are all 58mm you can get aftermarket 57mm basket but you have to order them in which is why james could not find one in time for the review,i own the grace victoria from lelit for a year now and i got to say if you are looking for a new espresso machine lelit is really good i would not recommend the anna though spending 100euros more can get you better feature and much better coffee,do you know what alternative basket one could buy or use to pull a better shot and is it worth it,i would like to see a similar video on electric grinder,i have had the lelit for 4 year now with a eureka mignon working well getting the niche next month so that video wa really exciting for me but i am now trapped with the whole 57mm setting and can not get a better basket cause they do not exist in 57mm i really feel like that would be a game changer anyway thanks james,what two vidoes in two day what are the odds now i even have nice entertainment while drinking an aeropress coffee which i bought after seeing your video and especially the making cappuccino at home episode by the way do you have plan for updating some of your manual grinder review comparison id love to hear your opinion about the hario skerton pro,thanks for the review i have stepped in the world of espresso with the dedica a few month ago i think it give a great value entry level machine for getting known in the possibility in brewing coffee it ha some option setting that you did not mentioned like adjustable brew temperature and brew time with that and a decent grinder i think i got pretty good espresso it is all about personal taste using my grindsettings coffeebeans and unpressured filter i think the extraction are a bit different from the regular 58 filter because of the smaller size of 51mm after a while i eventually will upgrade this machine so i can build up my technique,your summary of people that buy the sage or breville in my case is spot on and essentially the reason why i have one i knew it wa going to get me the result i would be happy with during the issue of 2020,why am i watching this i do not even drink coffee,dur because it is james,i think really interesting and helpful for so many not wanting to spend a fortune on a espresso machine why would not gaggia give that spring to all customer if that is so important mod,i think really interesting and helpful for so many not wanting to spend a fortune on a espresso machine why would not gaggia give that spring to all customer if that is so important mod,would be interesting to hear your thought on the gaggia new baby 06 nero a that is what i have i always thought of it a a cousin of the gaggia classic sharing many of the same part but for substantially cheaper due to more plastic part,i started my espresso journey with a gaggia pure which is basically a gaggia classic with cheaper more plastic part but similar functionality that wa 8 year ago and the internal component are still going strong it is just a dedicated milk steamer now though ever since i bought a cafelat robot last year also the gaggia is steam functionality suffers from not having enough pressure at green light you really have to start steaming at a certain point to keep the green light from turning on which will force the heating element to continuously produce more steam steaming milk volume higher than 150ml is a big challenge here,anyone know what basket james used for rancilio also james should have tried pulling some back to back espresso i find with silvia that while the first shot is great the pressure drop substantially i wonder if this is specific to the silvia or other machine suffer from back to back shot,chilledmatt123 have a ridged 20g that i never use too much coffee for my taste 18g seem right considering stock is 14g i believe btw doe ridged v ridgeless make a difference have a bottomless portafilter,i personally use 18g vst basket in silvia with great result,i own a gaggia classic the older model and the milk streaming would not be a problem at all with this tip after the steam light come on open the valve and let the steam flow after about 10 15 you will hear the steam power drop the boiler then kick in to heat up the steam power would kick up again after just about a few second keep the valve open the entire time so that you hear the steam power change and that is when i dig my pitcher in the general time spent would be longer of course but you get a much better experience the steam power then is really nice and in the pitcher there is a roaring whirlpool,do best manual espresso machine pleeeease,the best thing about james is that he speaks like he would speak in a real conversation which make it easier to listen to no sign of those overly exaggerated artistic voice that some apply on purpose cheer,great video i love comparasment video of yours it made me get comadante im jealous on the spoon also curious doe silver and other material inpact the flavor from some people i heard it doe i hope you do one in lever mashines this is the ralm where i would love to go next,love my lelit anna tem his review is very accurate would like to mention that 1st line equipment the u distributor is good too despite intermitent backstocks,you should use a denoiser or something like that in post production to get ride of the background noise the background i is just too loud and annoying great video otherwise,thanks now i can not stop hearing it xd,thanks a lot james in the beginning of the year we bought the delonghi dedica both for budget reason and to have an experience with piston machine our coffee experience ha definitely improved especially coming from a senseo haha though i did have some struggle with finding the right grind setting and i wa surprised to find that a coarser grind setting got better result with finer grind we sometimes had issue with getting coffee to run through at all frothing milk i found quite difficult it doe of course require skill and experience but i have not gotten a really really good result so far which i think make sense given your remark during the video i should just keep practicing recently based on experience from other people mostly online we tried a little lighter roast but i noticed the drink wa more sour than i expected sure i will need to fumble around with the setting a bit more but this comparison doe give some insight in how the machine we have compare to a bit higher segment,dang now i need to test milk steaming without the extra metal tube thing on my machine a well a look if there is a modding community for it d edit oh my that made a much more dramatic difference than i wa expecting,i have got the lelit anna pl41tem absolutely love it this version come with a pid too,john saxon are you having good result with it,love mine also just ordered the bottomless portafilter for it that come with a somewhat larger basket had to order it from england since 1st line doe not have it,lelit is an absolute underdog i have got the pl042em love it tho the basket size make shopping for alternate basket a little harder but a bottomless 57mm portafilterholder is for sale from lelit themselves and if you want to mod it to 58mm or 58mm with a pid you are pretty much on your own since there is not really a modding community for it and it probably will not be worth it since you can buy the pid version or the plus 58mm version for a few hundred extra,same here great machine,a a long time rancillio silvia user i can tell you the temperature surfing becomes frustrating if your spending that much money save a little more for a better machine otherwise you become frustrated like me and start using a moka pot more often,this is the video i have been waiting for,after wtching this channel for 6 month i have finally seen my lelit grabbed it on ebay for gbp300 havent looked back my steam wand metal producing decent micro foam and water tank more than decent for what i need james is right by upgrading the basket but the 57mm portafilter is all good defintely the most value for money i reckon,this is going to get a lot of view,i can not seem to find a non pressurised filter basket for the sage breville bambino plus in australia i am also a little new to making proper coffee at home,see if jet black espresso can help i got my ecm casa v from them and they have heap of good gear in their store,i have been waiting for this great video,will an hx machine like the rocket appartamento have more consistent temperature after a cooling flush,yes it is no competition i own the nera and it is super consistent hx are the best type in my opinion because you get fresh water drawn from the reservoir for the shot instead of boiler water the steam is on tap no extra waiting just make sure the portafilter is hot before you pull any shot whole latte love did some scace device test recently for the nera fyi,i have a lelit pl41tem for about 500dollar i got a pid a preasure gauge and a beautiful machine yes it is 57mm but rocking it for 2 year and love the machine the company definetly rock in this price range,me too it wa a big step up from my previous gaggia machine for not much more money,many thanks for this review much appreciated i went the silvia pid route with a niche zero and jx pro for travelling for now i have all my coffee box checked,i bought my sage for gbp200 in spring,i recently got the delonghi dedica a my first espresso machine with the mod to the basket and taking off the panarello wand i can make okay espresso and flat white may eventually upgrade to a gaggia or rancilio but for now it doe the job,wkhawaja7 i just got a 51mm non pressurised basket off amazon nothing fancy really you need to take out the plastic thing in the portafilter but it work pretty well,what basket did you mod it with mate,i have the rancilio and use it with a pid that control the temperature and do pre infusion to make it better i use a ims competition filter that make my espresso really better,i need a gif of james throwing the basket,i modded my delonghi steam wand to rancilio is one and change the tip to 3 hole type need a bit learning curve give better texture but still take long time also change portafilter to bottomless i noticed from your clip that my delonghi sound much quieter than yours not sure why,my dedica is a loud a this one much louder than my grinder dedica is not a good machine for home barista and people should stop misleading others into buying it,time is fine i have used commercial machine that just wouldump steam into the jug and you go from cold to hot 40c in 12 sec and they are useless,i think it is from the cup rattling on the top warmer i get that when i place stuff up there too,i have happily been using a lelit anna predecessor for a bunch of year now i have ordered a replacement basket and i m interested to see what happens with that thanks for the idea,have had a gaggia classic for 4 year the steam valve are crap but otherwise i like it however the temperature inconsistency is a problem and i find it need warming up for 20 30 min to give it best tempted by the pid mod maybe santa claus will bring me a pid kit for christmas this year,alan interesting the kit i ordered which ha not come yet come with 3 spring 9 bar 6 bar and 5 5 bar it is gotten to the point where i feel i now need a machine that let is me play with pressure and flow control and pre infusion oh if you get a pid get one with pre infusion it doe not cost much more i did not know about it and failed to get one of those,alex lazaridis f i am not sure but it did not seem to do any harm so i left it at 9 i get the logic about the higher pressure for use with the pressurised basket but i have never used one of those so if 9 is good for proper espresso then,alan oh i think you did the right thing the spring is just another way to do it did you find an improvement once you lowered the pressure,alex lazaridis f i am tempted by the pid mod for sure sometimes my shot are amazing and other time they are meh had not realised until i saw this that basket upgrade are a thing i may investigate i wa puzzled by the spring thing for reducing the pressure i wa able to reduce from about 13 bar down to 9 bar by loosening a hexagonal nut inside can not remember what it is called or where it is and i thought that wa all that wa involved have i missed something,do the pid mod it is worth it get a 9 bar spring from shade of coffee cheap add precision basket i have been making great espresso for month on it,if you are considering buying the lelit pl41 i would recommend getting the lem version it is not much more expensive look nicer le plastic part and the milk steaming is better than on the base model there is also the tem version which ha a pid,and compared to the europiccola,exactly what i am looking for,i love coffee but i am starting to think i would watch you review anything to be honest youtubers have a lot to learn from channel like this,yes indeed another great youtube reviewer is loopop for music and synth gear different style but also super useful review and a pleasure to watch,completely agree he is the gold standard for both review and coffee,james finally convinced me to get a silvia,it may be a marginal factor but talking about the heat up time and waiting time between brew steam mode would have been nice a well i had dedica before switching to la pavoni but one of the factor i got delonghi wa the fast heat up time bambino wa not available back then for those who are not sure about adapting their morning routine for 30mn heat up time quick thermoblock with compromise on temp stability is a considerable option i personally tend to make espresso and cappuccino at random time during the day so for me it wa quite a big factor,myung hwang park this could be another factor to bring into a test after a quick search it seems like lp and rancilo silva should not be left on for longer period of time they may overheat other model can safely be left on all day,zooloo73 i am also using a smart plug for my la pavoni although it heat up in le than 10mn w manipulation for heating up the gh still i can not anticipate heat up a i drink coffee at completely random time and letting lp turned on is a bad idea for that i could just turn dedica on and while preparing the pf it wa ready to go,i have my bezzera connected to a z wave power plug so i can switch it on from my mobile or even schedule it it also meter the power usage turned the machine on this morning and made a cup the last hour it ha used 0 08kwh to maintain temperature making the last cup of the day now 3pm and will turn the machine off,also a gaggia uk employee back in 2008 this classic is bringing back some memory need to dig out mine from the parent loft this weekend and get experimenting cracking vid a always jh,brilliant video a always james just out of curiosity why is this new vid only 1080p it look a bit blurred compared to your others,i bought a lelit anita with a pid and i am absolutely in love with it it wa the most cost effective way to get a pid machine and it ha been a workhorse so far hugely recommended,me too love my anna w pid come to temperature very quickly and hold it really well,i think i have the same 57mm pid and pressure gauge i hesited between a 58mm or a pid more or le the same price and i choose the pid i am also very happy with it even if i have the feeling not to master it very well probably because i drink mainly single espresso shot i have read it wa a bit more difficult to make,totally agree with this got a 41tem for my birthday this year and it ha really been a great little machine for me to finally get really into coffee a a hobby,yes lelit are very good and underated interesting price incredible temperature stability hopefully soon a marax will be on my counter,william saint agne fantastic machine,given the price point now the millon dollar question is how manual machine like robot compare to these if one is willing to forgo milk drink,i would be very interested in seeing the sage breville infuser reviewed on this channel,12 08 badass,i love how you care about all your viewer watching from saudi arabia,i have been eyeing these gaggias for a few week but i need a grinder upgrade first most likely in any event the james hoffman stamp of approval on it is great to have when i will eventually buckle and get one great video a usual,chris lawlor that is a good point,they do come with a pressurized basket that could maybe hold you over until you can your grinder,yes more of these please most of your viewer are bloke at home who dream of making decent to great espresso at home and drinking said espresso at home or taking it with u in a insulated mug while we go to work even those of u who have the cheddar do not want to spend thousand for the privilege of making a decent latte at home more content along these line please thank you,one of the best review of machine so far,where can you get non pressurized basket for the saga bambino i can not find them anywhere,there is a notfy option on the sage website here they do get stock if you need one urgently there is a couple in stock here,i will keep experimenting with the aeropress,i have the delonghi and yes i agree with everything said here but i got it for free so,james you forgot the cafelat robot in this comparison,andreas bork my robot is pretty damn good for having it le than a week do not have electric to compare and do not do milk based though,i also wonder how the robot or the flair would perform in term of shot quality,great comparison do you recommend to use one of these machine over the manual handlever like cafelat robot or flair,i had this doubt for the last few week ended up buying a robot,thank you for this comparison i have had the gaggia classic pro for several month and it is been great to learn to pull espresso on i do find the milk steaming hard to manage on it but rarely need it anyway which vst basket would you recommend,watching this while nodding my thrift bfc azzurra and regretting my choice,i am interested in experience with the lelit since there are not many review online or at least i could not find them there is a version with a pid or even the glenda for a bit more money with a commercial 58mm grouphead would somebody advise them in my country hungary a glenda with pid and 58mm head is not much more then a gaggia like 100 pound and sime price a a silvia thought any help is appriciated thank you edit i would not steam that much since i prefer espresso without milk maybe sometimes for my girlfriend also i am not really a handy person i am not sure if i wanted to modify right out of the box,i have the rancilio and will probably be using it for the next 10 20 year i can attest to the fact that it is built like a tank,btw you can choose three different temperature with the delonghi dedica you will get better result if you set it to high,ci nar once you learn how to change the temperature setting and pull some shot at each please let u know what your experience wa,how can you change the temperature ive had one for a year now and ive never heard of that,perfect timing for me your mind reading is working well,how about a good budget electric grinder grinder are all way overpriced i can buy a luxury steel snow blower with a massive engine for le than a good grinder,good one bought the bodum bistro at great discount a while back and there exist many mod to it see which make it perform like a semi high end grinder,wilfa svart but not for espresso,hey which basket did you use with the delonghi,i have to say that i use the delonghi at home a i have not got the space and i do not particularly like milky drink after modding and changing the heat to high i find that it doe a great job for the convenience and space,chrisb i am not the op either but if it help i have changed to a naked portafilter with an unpressurised basket i have also changed the steam wand to a traditional wand the rancilio sylvia and am now happy enough with the dedica,chrisb i am not the guy you originally replied to and i misinterpreted him after reading his sentence again he did made a modification and set the temperature to high if i would have to guess i would say he did the mod that james did to have an unpressurized basket along with setting the temp to high,arkay ahh okay thanks for replying i thought that you would perhaps taken the machine apart and modified something internally,chrisb you can change the setting water amount and brew temperature if i remember correctly through a combination of button press have not done this myself but it is described in the manual,what modification did you make,thumb up before watching,great video a always i have a bambino and really happy with it out of interest which vst basket did you use for it the only basket that came with mine are pressurised,luke hallam good to know basket are sold here,phil griffith thanks they must of been included recently my machine is a couple of year old happy to report still running a well a day 1 with daily use,james ha just posted that he used the sage own brand 54mm unpressurised basket you can order from their website when in stock i got my bambino a couple of month ago and it came with both pressurised and unpressurised basket,i am waiting for a review of a domestic espresso machine that really hit the sweet spot in term of performance result user experience build essentially the kind of machine that mirror james is first response to the niche that is the machine i want to see,i have been waiting for this one since a while now,what we really need is a video cheapest espresso machine to get a good espresso,thank you for another great video james i have the sage and what you have said is right on great if you want something that anybody can use without needing to develop the skill of a barista,rancilio just came out with a silvia pro it is a dual boiler machine with a built in pid but is more than double the price of the regular silvia would really love a comparison between that a rocket apartamento and maybe a la marzocco linea mini,what are the basket you are using to upgrade from the stock one and do you recommend going for an open portafilter a an upgrade to for example a sage barista express,watching james standing in this video make me realize how frickin tall he actually is,cj j me too,made me realize i wa sitting all day i should stand and stretch,i am unsure whether i should get the sage barista or just settle for the bambino now i am torn i quite like making my coffee in the morning but have gone away from espresso recently but my wife drink cappuccino so we need a machine that can produce good milk drink simply and easily one she can use on her own the built in grinder on the barista is a plus because i do not necessarily want to hand grind everything i have only got a hario manual grinder is it worth an extra gbp300,onraj9mm i did not mean that wa the main reason p afaik the barista can do more and you can play around with it more it is really looking for that balance between accessible and hobby so it can serve different purpose,you can get a decent grinder for 300 and still be able to upgrade the machine whenever you can would never go for a combo solution,wish i had had this video a few month ago although it probably would not have changed much i have a gaggia classic pro now and have already been looking at modding it to lower the brew pressure,i noticed from other review on the delonghi people tend to modify the steam wand by swapping in a rancilio silvia,wa waiting for this video for so so long,i really enjoy your video and they have really helped me with understanding coffee brewing not just espresso but pour over and so on i own a delonghi dedica it my first espresso machine it because of it save space my gf think coffee machine are ugly i really enjoy making espresso and latte but i will upgrade my grinder and the my espresso machine then i get the money it just a jungle to choose the right one,the delonghi drip tray look surprised to see you,great review i have owned a gaggia classic for quite a few year now and i really like it however i would totally agree with your conclusion about it a pid mod and ovp value adjustment is definitely worth doing,imagine being the one idiot who thumb downed this video,surprised there is no barista express did you deliberately avoid bean to cup machine is,excellent video a always i will be very interested to hear what you have to say about the silvia pro it ha a dual boiler and a built in pid so temp should be easier to control and more consistent it is also over double the price of the standard silvia which is frustrating but i still think worth a test,hi james happy dedica owner here a is ispecially with the stock portafilter the espresso it pull is really bad really need a naked portafilter to get away with much finer grind to get decent espresso though i think pulling a shot with 18g in is asking too much from this machine using recipe between 14g to 15 5g in 30g out 8and the shot i get are decent oh yeah i think the old dedica 650 is better for milk steaming the new nozzle on the 680 make it a difficult to get silky texture for latte and flat white in the 650 you can remove the cover to get more control still difficult and underpowered but manageable big fan here love your content,davey boy yes very much problem with the stock portafilter is that you have to use coarse grind resulting in weak espresso and almost non existent crema the naked portafilter allowed me to use two to four click notch finer on a hario skerton not sure if youtube will allow an instagram link but check this out,my dedica doe not have a good cream would the mod on the basket improve this a well a taste,edward conley have you tried it with a bottomless portafilter bigger headache to tune but mannnnn the result are so worth it,used a dedica for a few year and had the same experience fairly sure the machine is optimised for about 13 14g in and between 27 and 31g out it wa a pain figuring it out though and to say it regularly left me frustrated is putting it mildly,drinking my morning flat white which i just made on my gaggia classic pro to all people who are thinking about buying the gaggia you can get more steam power for a longer period of time if you begin steaming before the steam ready light is illuminated when you do this the heating element remains on during the steaming process allowing a higher steam pressure sustained for longer allowing a faster and better textured milk steaming,great effort fancy man maybe it will be interesting to see how the heating element of these machine affect their brew routine might open a can of worm but could be useful for some,super biased europiccola owner here but would have been great to see that chucked in there also think they retail around gbp400 or so these day,at 12 minute when he throw the filter my jaw dropped so much drama so perfectly timed beautiful james moment,you oversold that a little bit it wa not very dramatic at all,mohan kumar it needed the sound of a window breaking,i honestly would have liked to hear the filter clatter and him just stare at the camera,have not watched yet but have literally just bought a gaggia classic this week having owned the delonghi deidca for a yea let is hope i have made a good decision,phew,thank you,please do a video on basket what make a good basket what change with the difference in basket hole size hole number metal thickness etc,yes it would be short and the basket is not usually the problem a in any basket will work there are other area where you run into not making a good cup of coffee that are not the basket issue,k i k,if anyone is still wondering he just made a video a week ago explaining basket,scrumpymanjack probably should go do that yourself before posting a garbage comment that is wrong you may also want to get somebody to give you a hug,nick c you might want to look up what dilemma mean so that you can use it appropriately in the future good luck,i just re watched that peep show episode where toni yell mid coitus you are not taking the gaggia made me laugh,i have had a gaggia classic for around four month now and it is a significan not upgrade on the delonghi dedica i had previously with the niche zero arriving this week i think that is when i will be able to give a verdict on the espresso shot it can pull but i have certainly had the same issue you have outlined such a being above 9 bar of pressure stock and the temperature stability issue with that being said i got a pretty good deal on the classic sold my dedica for euros100 and purchased a second hand classic for euros150 great video a always,same a you here have not been able to get the niche yet since i am in the u but that will be next using the baratza sette now and it is great and cheap for zero retention and step le adjustment the build quality is poor but customer service is out of this universe i have done everything else to the classic pro except the temp mod since it is a little different t than the older classic,adam mchugh i think the gaggia need some mod to be really good and easy to use fortunately the mod can be done easily and somewhat cheap mine mine ha a pid big difference a brass group head proper and beautiful portafilters i also lowered the pressure a bit all done with the help of forum and video now ist make excellent espresso i don t drink milk so i don t care about the steam,alan angel have upgraded to a vst basket bottomless portafilter and rancilio steam wand yet to upgrade shower screen,i have been on the same journey a you a grinder upgrade will make a huge difference and then steam wand shower screen etc etc,hi james another great video thanks my first espresso machine wa a quaha napoletana which i think is the same a the lelit next wa the rancilio which gave me many year of faithful service temperature surfing is a must for both machine certainly the silvia i have now moved on to the breville sage dual boiler and i am loving this machine temperature control pre infusion pressure profiling etc cheer from another melbourne fan,i can absolutely recommend the de longhi dedica i bought one just before lockdown and because if it i have discovered the world of espresso it is the perfect machine to make one realise that a they enjoy espresso and b they need a better machine,have gaggia classic pro and niche zero but i have been struggling to pull good shot very sour coffee experimenting with different grind setting did not help tried different coffee weight did not help either the weird thing is that i have water coming out if this decompression tube all the time during the brewing is that normal checking that with the shop at the moment,you are the best thing in your video james,i love this kind of review thanks james are the super automatic next i am really curious to see you try and rate the plug and play jura phillips saeco and gaggia machine,bean but what bean should i buy or ground anyone else want someone to say buy x bean and grind like this good coffee or am i being lazy i just do not know which bean or ground to buy,simonelli oscar out of this budget review of gaggia wa accurate same with de longhi i still occasionally hit the button but nice unit for work being small and simple,i have been using my silvia for almost 4 year now and it is been rock solid it ha a notable learning curve but when i respect it is quirk i can get consistently good coffee some of the best i have had even compared to shop still hoping to mod my machine one day soon thanks james for another awesome review video,this video is slightly disheartening i have been saving up and i wa hoping i would find something i wa satisfied with in this price range it seems i will have to wait and save for the under gbp1000 video to have something i will be happy with for year to come,my bdb hit the deck earlier this week after 10 year i have been researching solidly thinking i could get away with something in this range with some mod i have come to the conclusion that i can not go backwards even if it is only making one coffee a day,i love these video and so want to learn more about how to best coffee but i constantly feel like i am in an a level class when i did not do the gcse where is a good place to catch up on the coffee making basic please thank you though these are a pleasure to watch even if i do not understand everything,great review would have loved to have gotten your thought on the breville infuser a well maybe that can be in the best 1000euros espresso machine video,ive waited year for this video thanks,at the end of the series i would love an overview best espresso for every price category starting with mokkapots at 20euros and ending with some ridiculous 3000euros machine probably no one will buy,an excellent and informative video a always thank you i am about to upgrade from my gaagia classic which i have had for 18 year i went from an inexpensive burr grinder to a rocky and now using a niche zero this is substantially more expensive than any of these machine most people me included do not realise the importance not to mention the cost of the required grinder i am not sure which grinder james used here it would probably be more expensive than one that would be bought by the prospective purchaser of any of these machine,emma simpson so he did emma thank you i remember the chart but had not remembered the title a good buy with the rancilio and a good choice with the zero,james used his niche zero and ha put the grind setting he used for each at 15 05 definitely a grinder considered by prospective purchaser all these machine were on my shortlist of machine to buy in the end i went with a silvia second hand got it on ebay in great condition for under gbp300 and ordered a niche zero to go with it which arrived this week definitely considering a pid,we need just the best home machine linea mini r58 etc,i really enjoy my sage duo temp pro got it for 300euros and it pretty amazing for the price,i have been waiting for this one thanks a always james great video,lol 500 quid,bottomless portalfilter an an other steam wand from rancilla on the dedica i also preheat the water to around 60 c so the brew temperature is way more consistent and hotter,can we get a link to buy the basket he put on the delonghi,i have a baby gaggia what would you consider a a good upgrade,we need a manual espresso machine comparison,the silvia is an absolute beast i am glad to see the v6 in your video once you spend some time and have patience to get to know your silvia and learn how to manage the temperature the shot are delicious,thanks for this video james i have had a gaggia classic pre 2015 for many year and have been wondering what the next step up for me would be i saw the new classic pro and it piqued my interest but review do not suggest the improvement are that significan not steam wand set up good but pressure poor my gaggia ha served me really well might be that i move to modifying it to develop but equally potentially looking forward to the next step up again for machine so will keep an eye out for a next cost bracket video should you have time and inclination,i recently got myself a gaggia classic and an ascaso i mini i2 grinder but i have been having issue getting the shot to run for longer it usually only take about 12 second for the shot to pull even at the finest grind setting not sure if i am just that bad at this or if there is an obvious fix or if the commentsection of a youtube video even is a good place to ask around for this,what are your thought on the sunbeam cafe series em7000,do not sure about touching this tube while cleaning water tank in gaggia it wa pretty tricky to put water tank back in,you can adjust the setting of the dedica including the temperature,the rancilio clearly take the cake here or would take the cake rather since for only 30 buck more you can get a bezzera hobby which since the last update is better in every regard bringing much better temperatur stability a copper boiler commercial group head etc a comment on the lelit for a few buck more you can get this with a pid and a real steam wand not sure if the boiler is bigger on that one but i reckon and read report the steam performance will be improved nonetheless since the anna wand really is sub par and more of a byproduct of the panarello rather than a wand that is supposed to be used for steaming another thing to note the lelits are a pain to service repair on the anna it is kinda ok since there is not much inside but any of the bigger machine are just a nightmare there are repair shop over here that refuse to even open those machine but still they make suprisingly good coffee for the price and i know of two machine that have been running for over 6 year now without a hitch and i do not think they even have been descaled once so at that price point you litteraly can dump them in the trash and buy a new one when they fail,jules leenders i am just referring to the fact that the bigger one are impossible to repair i owned a pl60 trust me you have to disassemble the whole littetally the whole machine to exchange simple component a the pump no bueno,namenaamenameenaamee i can imagine the dual boiler are a lot more complicated yea though i am not 100percent agreeing on the use and dispose argument yes the side panel on the single boiler atleast are a little thin and maybe cheap and thin although they will not rust so that is a big plus and the button are made of plastic i do not think they are necessarily designed to be thrown away if it fails since at least the single boiler are easy to work on,jules leenders a i said the single boiler one are ok the dual boiler like the pl60 i e are just impossible all of them are a far cry from a bezzera rocket etc though where you loosen a few nut and just pull off the side panel to get access to pretty much everything you can literally tell where the money go with those machine the component are decent but these machine are made to be used and then disposed of,tbh the pl041 anna and pl042 is quite easy to open up and maintain plenty of room to work in them and pretty straight foward internal design not sure how the more expensive model are to work on i can imagine that the pid version come with a spaghetti of wire but still they are not that complicated,would be interested in how these compare to the la pavoni understand they are very different but which would you use for at home that is enjoyable to make and produce great shot but is also easy enough for day to day i am thinking the silvia right now,james fancy please,another great group test i am intrigued at the sage choice the duo temp pro fit in the price band and i suspect fill the gap between the performance of the bambino and the gaggia sylvia i have had mine 3 year and love it though i am still crap at milk texturing but that is me not the machine,bradley dowis i do not think this is available officially in the uk it is a shame co it look good and ha the pressure gauge that is lacking from the dtp,sage breville infuser is worth a hard look too,same here got the dup temp pro a month or so ago and i absolutely love it clicked on this video thinking i would see it here none the le fun watch,robert pugh ah love my duo temp pro a well and i still struggle with milk texturing a well glad i am not the only one,same here i would be interested why the sage duo temp pro wa not considered a a part of this review,here are 5 machine i changed stuff on 3 so the other one ha a disadvantage why did you do that you should have just made a shitty cup right,would love to see a high end prosumer machine comparison video,wa considering the silvia ended up buying the robot,i like a lot of texture in my shot with the express being thick a hell also i drink a lot of lighter ethiopian coffee so being limited to dark roast alone is a no go for me,roman rabinovich meh i am not a fan of pressurized pf espresso i prefer naked extraction,could have got a joepresso and saved even more work great for dark roast,grant mcwilliams if you are open to hand grinder i find the 1zpresso jx pro work pretty well for flair and it is just dollar159,grant mcwilliams i bought the niche been usinng comandante so far but hand grinding for espresso is time consuming,once again sense and sensibility you have relieved the 9 bar on pressure being in lockdown for 7 week now melbourne you are such a breath of fresh air thanks,sometimes life feel like a pressured portafilter glad ur well,simon trusler both are good but very different drink a a fellow melbournian ive been mucking around with the world barista champ recipe for aeropress refreshing change to a familiar coffee v60 is definitely a great rabbit hole to be going down at the moment though i miss dine in long black,kaine whiteway thanks for the advice i have been pondering whether to get a v60 so it is good to hear that it is a superior experience i will starting checking them out,simon trusler a a fellow melbournian i wa hoping james would do this i have also been using an areopress for around 8 year but have just changed to the v60 based off this channel and i must say it is a superior experience what is do miss is the ability to make a decent coffee milk drink at home,only 7 week it is felt like an age we will make it though,great to see the classic in a review i have had one for ten year now and still like new only just recently found out you could lower the pressure it make a big difference now about that modding community,just google r gaggiaclassic or gaggia classic mr shade,i have had the bambino for 4 month now so far i have been very pleased with the milk quality manual steaming and programmability but have had issue with temperature and pressure the shot are somewhat cold and the machine choke if i use more than 16g of a relatively coarsely ground medium roast coffee also i have modified the pressurized filter by cutting away the bottom layer which pressurized the basket because breville ha been out of stock of the unpressurized double basket for month naturally i would have preferred if the machine came with a stock unpressurized filter but i hear that the newer bambino are now shipped with both type,yes the newer bambino do get unpressurised basket at least mine did and james ha just posted in the comment above that he used the sage breville unpressurised basket in this video,a an owner of the delonghi dedica i find jame is assessment of it spot on yes it requires two hand to load the group handle and yes the steam wand is infuriating which i recommend modifying it with a silvia replacement but a for the cup size the foot drip tray is removable for larger cup i got it for price and foot size,nikotuba ohhhh do you have the aliexpress link please,bobbie yes i have being drinking coffee for about 5 moth too and is such an experience and definitely relaxing i went to get my dedica a few hour ago and i am ready to learn,i have a dedica and later i got a new bottomless portafilter it made all de difference you can really play with different setting and taste the difference,celia n ter if you are like me who find making coffee calming relaxing and not care about some professional is opinion definitely it is pretty straight forward than i thought i have only been making and drinking coffee for le than 4 month now i went from a french press to aeropress to dedica now i just go for a grind size that feel like salt but i can not tell the difference in taste if my grind size differs a little bit the machine choke when i use close to talcum powder like fine since i am using pressurized basket i still would have went for dedica even if there wa a better machine at the same price because it is really small and doe not take up much space i hope it can produce decent result after i mod the steam wand if not i will just be spending like a minute more with the french press,bobbie do you recommend it today i wa going to check one is used but for to froth my milk i have q froth machine from instant super good oh it will be my first espresso machine i do not know if i will know how to use it lol,i have the gaggia and had a similar experience with the steaming sometimes it is really powerful and that is often when i have left it on for a while or when i have maybe caught it just at that right point of temperature it is made great espresso a far a i can tell but it ha not been a consistent a i would like modding it is on my list of thing to get around to at some point new basket and maybe a bottomless portafilter for those sweet sexy espresso photo first,it would be awesome to have a video about modification for u who have low budget machine,i have a silvia v4 that is retired to the shed because i have switched to v60 at home but i have a hankering to try espresso again what i am really looking forward to is the next bracket up from this with the a yet unreleased silvia pro v sage dual boiler that is going to be an interesting group test,whats your opinion about the fellow ode,i have not got one yet,what a wonderful video shared on my fb could not wait to see the gbp1000 and 2000 group thank you very much,excited for this because i have a saeco thats older and have been eyeing the gaggia,the one we have all been waiting for though no surprise at the overall winner still a great insight into the benefit of each machine,seemed like there were three winner for three different type of people,finally i have been waiting for this almost a much a ultimate aeropress technique,i bought a sage bambino at the start of lockdown and it is been great happy that it came with with unpressurised basket you can swap out and i really like the auto milk frother it is nice to set the jug on the sensor and leave it until it auto shuts off i realise i am likely to never get into latte art plus i am lazy,can you tell u which vst basket you purchased for the silvia,doe this mean we can expect a 500 1000 and finally get your long awaited opinion on the sage barista express,absolutely loving my bambino mine came with a non pressurized basket included and it is worth to note that the machine heat up and it is ready to use in 3 second,another vote for breville bambino just got it today and new to this but the expresso wa great,i would love to see a comparison of the bambino v the duo temp pro there doe not seem to be any info online comparing the two,mike sprinkle just got a bottomless portafilter it is a game changer also lowered the dose to 14 gram and a smaller ground size the lower dose did not choke the machine wa able to pull a good shot using medium roast bean normally a medium roast with a higher dose 17 to 18 gram would pull a bitter shot,dan vr46 that is interesting do you have a link i have looked at some of the third party basket but it is hard to tell what you are going to get,i ran more temp experiment on my bambino this morning read all about it here,when are you going to cover cheaper grinder for espresso,james big ol hand hoffman,this could be merch lol,never realised but you are right his hand are really big,georgius md let is pretend this comment never happened,james fancy man hoffman,this is so brilliant i posted a reddit post about it a few day ago since i could not find a video of yours for this pricerange,where are people buying vst filter struggling,how did you modify the delonghi dedica can you provide more detail,open naked portafilters size 51mm are available on aliexpress wish ebay a are unpressurised basket if you do want a naked portafilter make sure the one you buy ha the three tab on it a your original delonghi portafilter ha i purchased both a naked portafilter and unpressurised basket but am sticking to the original pressurised basket until i can get a better grinder using a single basket at 7grams on the dedica is pretty pointless i stick to the double basket and 12 gram ground into the basket,minimally i just removed the screw in the portafilter and applied violence to remove the plastic inner then put in a proper basket,very enjoyable video james thanks,now i beg for video about which cheapest grinder would be suitable for those espresso machine gaggia owner,would you make new cheap hand grinder test there are some interesting like 1zpresso xeoleo timemore c2,my thought whenever a reviewer say hey i am biased is no you are far from biased and that is why i although i am not yet a coffee hobbyist am so interested in watching your vidoes,to be fair everyone is biased good reviewer are the one who acknowledge and are transparent about their bias and why,great video i looked a lot at this category when doing research but ended up going to the next price range to find something that had wife acceptance factor steam whilst pulling shot and build look oscar ii would be great if you do another video in the next range too,hi james for le than 500 pound you should have gotten the lelit anna pl41tem which ha a pid and a proper steam wand,james hoffmann too bad it would have been a worthy opponent,i could not get one in time it wa not in stock when i wa buying these,thanks james for this video i bought the lelit anna pl41tem last week the one with pid and i am enjoying it i would live to upgrade the basket you mentioned you could not get them in time can i ask what is the part you were looking for thanks 57 mm s actually the only complaint,i spat out my tea wen i saw this,i have the bambino so wa hoping it would not get too badly mocked though i am quite happy with it anyway a i prefer darker roast and enjoy being able to leave it to automatically steam the milk when i am in a hurry and multitasking also nice that it keep track of when it need to be cleaned and descaled,i own the bambino plus now for a few month it come with 4 filter basket 2 of them were un pressurized and i get pretty good shot after a while of testing i grind pretty fine and get good flow not like james maybe you get a machine from the first version there is an updated version now with all the basket and maybe more power i own the all stainless steel version wich look much higher in quality,this reminds me i must sell my gaggia classic pro,big lelit fan,i am largely interested in how you would modify the machine for different brew pressure i understand how to implement a pid for better temp control but i would really like to have more control over brew pressure for reference i am using an ascaso dream which i plan on installing a pid in edit i wrote this because you teased the process with the comment you made towards the end of the video haha,i am going to be buying a gaggia classic pro within the next few month getting my niche in november the new gaggia doe not have any adjustment however if you visit reddit or any other gaggia forum you will find that everyone modify is it using a mr shade opv kit this kit come with a few different spring 9 6 3 bar to alter the brew pressure installation is very easy and you can easily revert the machine back to stock pressure,i know you can adjust the over pressure value to get your 9 bar but also you can control the power going to the pump for preinfusion and pressure profiling google gaggia classic dimmer mod for example,at least the delonghi drip tray is happy,i have got a silva with pid and love it no need to temp surf great value for the money imo,chris imbert ok thanks for an answer i know auber but this one is not so nice d i wil try to wait once silvia pro will be released and maybe it will be possible to install a pid from this machine also to old one we will see,averagescotchaddict thanks but i already have silvia for a year and tbh i do not wan na change it at this moment,chris imbert auber is the pid brand that scg put on their machine totally worthwhile mod new sylvia pro model coming from the factory with dual boiler and pid only took 20 year,rob lucchetti i saw that i am not overly familiar with other machine around that price point but i would definitely be interested if i made more milk based drink,there is a rancilio pro coming out with dual boiler and dual pid for about 1700 usd talk about a beast machine for the money,now we need a best 1000euros espresso machine video,agree next gear please d,this aged well,he released best 1500 espresso machine today,yes please,best he can do is 1500,i have the delonghi dedica ec685 with a modified unpresurised basket and the coffee is amazing it taste like my favourite coffee shop,hi james which basket did you buy for the delongi thanks,james hoffmann is not the stock basket 51mm how doe the 54mm from sage fit the portafilter,great thanks just asking because i am not sure if there is varying amount of quality or are they all pretty standard i bought a 54mm from ebay,i used the 54mm one from sage,i wa just thinking about when you would release this vid then saw it with a released 4 minute ago and wa happy,have you ever used la pavoni is semi automatic cellini cll it sort of belongs this range and unfortunately there is not much said written on it i would be really interested to hear your thought,thanks for the information james,delonghi dedica tip you can remove the panarello steam cover off the wand to expose a rubber nozzle that is better for steaming micro foam than the stock or you can replace it with a silvia steam wand off ebay temp surf using the steam button to cycle it on and off make sure to flush the machine with hot water after heating up steam while temp surfing if you do this before each espresso it make it far more consistent you can also do the temp surf cycle above to get hotter steam steam button on steam off flush hot water till the light stop flashing to have hotter steam use a toothpick to break up clunk this machine is really finicky and the slightest fault in your ground bed can mess it up use a toothpick or other tool to break up small clump before tamping lastly make sure your water is at room temp in the water bin at the back of the machine if it is cold water the brew temp will be too cold and you will get sour espresso use filtered scale free water to reduce need for descaling for all machine pour boiled water from kettle onto metal end of portafilter to preheat it for hotter water for more extraction also there are 3 temperature setting and 3 hardness setting on the machine i suggest using setting 3 for a light roast,james kyp that wa a good answer thanks i think i will go for the flair in december i am okay with the result i get from frothing milk on my french press i do not mind it i just want to slowly work my way into a great expresso and if sometimes i screw up and it taste a bit different i feel i will enjoy the process of studying it developing my taste and learning to dial in i kinda really like the manual aspect too and durability a far a i know every piece and screw is replaceable i work in a sound studio with bad coffee so every now and then taking my setup and pulling some shot for my coworkers would certainly be fun,gordan babi do these thing and you will fix it your bed of coffee must be level make sure you have a quality grinder temp surf to make sure the water is hot enough to create pressure to keep bed compact use a toothpick to break up clump distributor i use matow 51 mm off amazon to make the coffee bed even and then tamp it make sure your portafilter is hot using boiled water,alp zeren really recommend using a tool pick clump breaking tool and a distributor for this machine if you ever choke the machine,sebastian schumacher probably a breville bambino personally a flair is awesome if you only want espresso flair will be much harder to use tbh i really recommend a breville bambino on sale not rrp if you want milk based coffee if you want milk based coffee and can not afford bambino get dedica if you just want good espresso and do not mind a learning curve the flair is going to last you a lifetime flair ha highest potential out of these three for espresso but far more inconvenient the lack of temperature regulation on the dedica and the complete lack on the flair mean that the breville is going to give you consistent brew water temp if that did not answer it i can further clarify if you tell me which feature are most important to you i can tailor the recommendation more towards you,if you could choose between it and a flair what would you go for i am thinking of cheap good espresso for home,out of the box i found the dedica too cold a well but it can be turned up in the setting equally if you pre run a couple of shot worth of water through before it stabilises the head temp a bit still not ideal but workable on a budget,jon massey i see thanks,sebastian schumacher you still get the time and pressure consistency that you do not get with a manual machine not least until you have got your technique dialled in for me it is no biggie to press the button a couple of time while i weigh and grind my coffee it is a cheap machine with a thermoblock rather than a boiler you get far faster start up time something james did not cover in the video but at the expense of stability,hearing up in the setting sound reasonable pre heating by pulling water shot not really since you might a well get a flair if you have to,no matter what james uploads first like then watch,what if you didnt like the show doe clicking dislike become an option i ask because im trying to change the way i interact with all of social medium defining what i like and dislike is a pretty big part of my world view ive discovered that having absolute allegiance became a source of dogma for instance the way i viewed politics wa impacted by my definition of like anyways cheer,lol,true lol,i hit like just cause of the title of the video,it is not like we need to see it to know it is good,just a quick thought any sbdu without a pid is pretty bad the lelit pl41tem is under 500 pound and clearly the best entry level machine,love these comparison video just like the dialing in setup video see you at the coffee tasting,i am saving money to get an espresso machine at home just so you know watching you and your video really made me want to own one,if you enjoy coffee you will not regret buying a machine for one minute for what it is worth my advice would be to save a much a you can and go for the best reviewed model possible you will save money in the long run,you must be absolutely buzzed after a test like this we appreciate your commitment to the cause,i love it when james uploads the moment i make myself a coffee,love the fancy spoon,please please make a video about pressurised portafilters do they produce a good espresso if you do not have access to unpressurised basket how to dial in espresso with them,steven doesburg i know he is right i would swap my basket if i could for sure but i can not find 51mm unpresserised in my country and if i buy it from somewhere else i have to pay 20 30 dollar shipping for a 5dollarbasket,amirali vaziri see 11 55 for a comprehensive review,this plz,yes this is what i have been waiting for,me too,yep this ha sold me on the bambino when it is back on offer at gbp250 gbp399 is a rip lol it sound like it will do exactly what i want quick easy hobbyist coffee with a low effort milk option for 7am coffee and manual for when i want to experiment,oh nice i watched the test with machine under 100 pound just a minute ago thank you,here i fixed your video for you,james i am a fancy man hoffmann,i am disappointedly only a few month into a different brand of the molina model which replaced a similar model only due to a missing lid for the output bin it is going to be some time before i move on to a quality upgrade boo,edward yuuuup pam,nate office reference,jimothy hoffmann,a fancy man with his fancy fancy auntie donna fan by any chance,no ecm casa v,love the new video space,proud to see the baby lelit anna is up there,maybe someday just got my wilfa uniform from smr,no barista express,literally waited year for this well done,james is the kind of guy who invite you to his friend is party then doe not show up himself,can u tell u how to tackle and made a pretty good espresso using a 100 500 euro coffee machine,the video we all waited for if i were to invest in espresso i would probably go for an appartamento,not the new lelit mara it look interesting,the giotto is worth the extra price,audio seems slightly off there is a little bit of reverb,it is just the room and the mic he is using the room is to live which is fine it just creates natural reverb which is not ideal but not much the audio tech can do in post well there is but it is sooooo annoying to fix,back to our root let is go,ah 20 more minute of the goodness that is james hoffmann talking being in covid lockdown is a bit easier today,aeropress guide,ooh it is here excited,who else ha been waiting for this like it is christmas,awesome i could not wait for this video i just wish the new breville barista max wa out by the time this wa shot,i wish i could meet james and have a conversation in a coffee shop i would learn all the thing,dashing dave why can not it be both,dashing dave you could do a podcast with him called dashing dave amp the fancy man,dashing dave all the thing,coffee thing or large handed fancy man thing,scherlynn buzenes we all do,am early for once,yes,first,the video we have all been waiting for,yes yes yes,here we go,1st,confirmed you were first

1 58 dedica pricing 2 29 espresso and milk result 2 55 modifiability 4 00 conclusion,hi tom i really like watching your video and i plan to get into the exchange for a rancilio wand but i wa wondering one thing which temperature and water hardness setting do you have set i know water hardness is a subjective thing but i would like to know yours thank you for your reply,hey gabriel here in germany we have extremely hard water so i choose hard water it just reminds you earlier to descale i also use a brita filter to help demineralizing the water first i also use the hottest setting stay tuned a i will be releasing a video next week about temperature measurement for the dedica cheer,by just looking at the steam wand i will have to pas,make me coffee yeah ok but the oscar is a prosumer heat exchanger machine kinda comparing apple to grapefruit there,tom is coffee corner my oscar can steam milk in 10 second,make me coffee haha well all these little machine take a little longer to steam milk do you know of a quicker one,tom is coffee corner yeah but it will take like a minute to steam the milk,ha ha to each his own it actually doe a pretty good job though with the sleeve off,this is the only coffee machine i have owned bought in february but i have just ordered a second one for my parent house awesome value for money especially a i have bought refurbished machine which are half the price for to minor cosmetic scratch,hey taghg i would recommend the sage smart grinder pro it ha the best feature for the money before stepping up to something like the specialita here is the link,incidentally do you have a recommendation for an affordable grinder which can directly fill the portafilter the review of the dedica grinder suggest it doe not grind fine enough,purchasing month ago from amazon de with milk mug and tamper for almost 155 euro and it is a good price i think yesterday bottomless portafilter arrives so i am ready for a goood morning coffee i am looking for a delonghi grinder 521 m also dedica do you have any observation on it thanks,wow that is a great price which color did you get i have not used the kg521 but i think you can mod it to grind finer i probably would suggest the smart grinder pro a the best starter grinder for the money,you need more view i enjoy these i have such a tough time with creama and my dedica,hey it is mostly just using freshly roasted bean crema exists due to the carbon dioxide escaping and if they are too old then this process can not happen,hi tom have you found a 9bar spring that we can install except the spring mod where we cut the spring,nikos stavrakas exactly nailed it,tom is coffee corner ah now i see what you mean yes i have seen this video too so you mean that 11 12 bar is the maximum pressure if there is 100percent resistance and thus if water pas through the puck the pressure might be 8 9 bar,nikos stavrakas no i mean the manometer installation video there you see that i get 8 9 bar with an unmodded opv i reach 9 bar with the mod but only at max pressure espresso puck however do not provide maximum resistance,tom is coffee corner yes i have already seen it but i feel that i might cut it at the wrong spot and then pressure will be off d,to be honest i recently installed a manometer and it come out to be in between eight and nine bar please take a look at the recent video,it a brilliant machine tom partner satisfaction is a massive plus in our house a counter space is not great since doing all your the mod and replacing the pressure valve once we have been very happy it saved me load a i wa going to spend 4 5 time a much to replace it when the apv went and i found your channel thanks dude,awesome dude thanks so much for that feedback i am happy that you are enjoying the machine,i respect you but i absolutely disagree bambino is a much better alternative dedica come from the factory with different brew pressure it is a lottery mine is brewing at a very high pressure and even with an open basket it is hopeless bambino mostly have similar low pressure so you can always pull a better shot with an bottomless portafilter,the bambino plus is a delightful machine but it cost three time the price of the delonghi i managed to pick one up for euros85 because it wa not pulling water i fixed it and i have been enjoying using it i will be posting some video about that machine in the future,hey tom super video a always mine i just changed with a new one and work a it should i wanted to ask can you mix preground coffee with fresh grounded coffee,tom is coffee corner thanks man your the best,haha i would be lying if i said i have never done that but i would not ordinarily recommend it cheer,the delonghi dedica is one of my favorite manual coffee maker i brew 14 gram of coffee and use a double portafilter i have found that if i use a small amount of coffee it will be undercooked,another tip is to use medium to dark coffee but more in the dark side since the temp is no so high to use light to medium roast however i am using a hack to increase temp a follows push the steam bottom wait to be ready to steam then turn off the machine and turn on run the preinfusion cycle without the portafilter and stop the cycle when finish the preinfusion then insert the portafilter and do the espresso extraction a normal i do not have a fast response termometer but it seems the water temp is higher that way judging by the espresso flavor i get,this is a super good tip thanks a lot,rincon that is a very cool idea i just tried it and the espresso seems noticeably hotter i am going to experiment with this hack the upcoming day and document my result,hi tom i am increasing the temp stability a follows remove the spring from the portafilter put coffee ground directly in the basket with out the portafilter when done i put the portafilter without the basket in the machine and run two cycle of water to warm up the portafilter put the basket in the portafilter and wait 15 20 sec to warm the basket and finally do a normal extraction i do not have a termometer probe a you have but the coffee is now better the idea of removing the spring is to insert without effort the basket avoiding to generate crack in the puck,tom is coffee corner the basket is in contact with the portafilter and the coffee with the basket so a soon the puck receive hot water it will cool down via the basket and the portafilter water temp is key for a good extraction for medium roast coffee water should be around 92 degree thats why i am preheating the portafilter and using the temp increase hack if you still have a stock portafilter would be interesting to see a graph of temp versus time,a rincon i think the best thing is to use a bottomless then the espresso can not come into contact with anything at a lower temperature plastic portafilters are bad because even if you try preheating them they do not retain the heat the is one big downside to the portafilter of the bambino plus,tom is coffee corner interesting but anyway the problem is the portafilter will drain the temp in the puck so need to be hot before the extraction have you seen an all plastic portafilter that would solve the problem too or an isolation with the basket but this could be challenging,a rincon ok nice did you know that the heavier stainless steel specialista pf fit too you just have to remove the plastic part inside i am saving that for a future video,tom is coffee corner i use the stock portafilter with ims basket,well maybe we are waiting video of 5 top reason not to buy this machine,good idea i think i will do that,hey tom regarding heating up have you thought about isolating the rubber pipe that pas the water from thermoblock to the group head with some kind of thermal isolating tape i am far away from my machine right now doing a career break in central america to check that but that might help in thermal loss what ya think,hey marek i wa kind of hoping someone might do this and post their result i may do that in a future video otherwise refer to rincon is post above where he talk about putting the dedica in steam mode turning off then on and getting hotter result that way,just starting with my coffee experience so i bought a dedica ec785 a there wa discount and come with all the accessory included i am just a bit afraid of temperature a i read that dedica in general doe not heat the water really good but maybe this will be different from 685 about the steam wand there are plastic adapter that you can put on the rubber wand so you do not need to tie it,a rincon that is actually helpful thanks a lot seems that is not needed for now on my ec785 got really hot cup of coffee,tom is coffee corner not the panarello there are thin adapter in order to cover the rubber so it doe not get removed by the pressure you can find em on ebay btw my dedica just arrived and temperature seems really hot i am using pressurized filter for now but once i will learn a bit i will upgrade for now i am really happy i made 3 coffee and they taste really good thanks for the video,very nice i would like to have an ec785 for the different color the tamper is nice too is not it which plastic adapter do you mean not the panarello,hi see my comment about temp,also you can change the steam wand from the now delonghi dedica and it will work with same feature i will contact with my delonghi agent to provide me the now steam wand i think i will get good experience the normal one which is available on amazon it did not give me good experience because i have to wipe it fast after steaming the milk the problem is if i keep it like three or 4 second the milk will stick on the steam wand this is the problem with the now one it is insulated inside steam wand it will not burn the milk,tom is coffee corner i will,salem let me know if you can get the updated steam wand a featured on the ec885 that would be cool,anyone ha a suggestion on the best budget espresso coffee grinder to go with this no point for me to get a unpressurized basket if i can not grind fine thanks,hey there i can recommend these euros80 graef euros200 sage euros400 specialita,i have the problem when steaming milk without the outside metal part that the rubber piece always pop off because of the pressure during the steaming the milk get spilled all over the place do you also have had this problem yet,what i do is to open the steam lever very slow,tom is coffee cornerthank you very much tom i will use that idea for sure,yes quirin i had that problem just attach a little cable tie to the rubber nozzle then it will not pop off stop the video and look closely and you will see it while i am frothing milk cheer,hi tom do you have a link for non preasurised basket for uk thanks in advance,jason dawson no prob jason these link are in the description too now i added them bottomless portafilter amazon,tom is coffee corner thanks tom do you have a link for the portafilter also sorry to be a pain,hey jason here is one in stock that is the 2 cup basket that i use in most of my video,i have that machine but i have not been able to pull decent shot of espresso so many variable only once i got crema i bought a bottomless portafilter which interestingly go in easier than the original one i will watch your other video and keep trying,a rincon thank you for the tip,hi tony try fresh coffee correct grind size for 20 to 30 sec extraction 15 pound tamping unpressurized basket and see my comment about temp it should create great crema,jason dawson i ordered from amazon it is called nrp 51mm bottomless portafilter the two thing to watch for make sure it is a 51mm and it ha three ear good luck,can i ask where you bought your portafilter a do not want the hassle of getting it wrong cheer,i will wait for the new 885 model,yes i am really curious to try it too just have to wait for availability,hi tom a you know i have a dedica 685 which i modified including bottomless portafilter ims 14g basket rancilio steam wand and your shortened spring mod it is a great little machine and a you say heat up pretty quick i love the size of it a you know i live on a boat so space is limited i thoroughly recommend the dedica to anyone starting out and there is always second hand out there if money is an issue great video again tom andrew,tom is coffee corner thanks i will keep an eye out for them coming back in stock,ian seward they are not alway in stock but here is the link,where did you source the ims basket from,amen to all those point andrew i think it is so cool that you can run one of these dedicas on a boat that must be awesome to be on the open water enjoying the open horizon and an espresso to boot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

black and decker drip coffee maker and oxo grinder making nabob columbian the best i have tasted cappuccino with my breville cafe rom on weekend,how much espresso volume you get at the end maybe it is the cup size and video perspective but by default mine seems to pour quite le than what i see here thus often end doing pressing 2x the 2 cup for what is meant to be a single person is espresso thank

the coffee will be better,so you put one video on your channel got just under 500 subscriber and 129k view on your video impressive and thanks for the video,i still do not realize it is crazy youtube is algorithm thanks for passing by,thanks for the video i just got the same machine for my morning coffee routine would you be able to make some video on how you froth milk for latte etc would love to learn,stay tuned it should arriver soon,for 2 espressi at the same time 28g 52sec,no the time should be the same you have to grind coarser for a 2 cup filter,hi thanks for the video i use the same machine and i need to know the grinding number you used 1 6 for the espresso shot can i use the same for a bottomless portafilter waiting for your kind reply,i actually use the oxo conical burr grinder dollar99 grinder i got for free so figured i would try to make good espresso with what i have that and a dedica arte i use the very finest grind on the oxo and i get decent espresso with a bottomless filter despite what naysayer have told me,if i had to grind for a bottomless portafilter i would use the finest setting 1 on the dedica grinder it may not be enough meaning you would need another grinder that would grinder finer,it look good but sorry it is not good coffee toy,hello do you use 1cup filter or 2 cup filter,for 1 espresso i use 1 cup for two i use the 2 cup filter,what is your grinder setting,mark anthony manuel i use the normal setting not intense,how about the roast profile,scale 2 of 18 on the grinder,this wa beautiful to watch,i am upping my coffee game this year got this machine for christmas love your set up your accessory give me some idea thank you,and are you using in the video the dedica ec695 or the ec685 i tried to look up the 695 online but the 685 only pop up for me thank you,the gadget you used to flatten the espresso what is that called can you link the one you used please,coffee time what are your favorite bean and brand to make coffee in

until later it wa not showing thank you i have seen the delonghi dedica deluxe espresso maker and the deloghi dedica ec695 are they the same machine and if not which one is most compared to yours,rachael valdivieso look at my previous message i have just answered your question about the ec695,coffee time thank you love your video using this delonghi espresso maker and in the video are you using the ec685 or ec695 i tried to look up the 695 and it is not showing up for me,lasciate perdere l ho comprata da 4mesi oggi l ho rivenduta ho comprato una sage barista 500 pound ma tutt altra storia il caff anche se l ho macinato fino esce poco denso e la schiuma poca e nn compatta ho usato i migliori caff lavazza arancione e kimbo provati anche nella sage differenza enorme,what is the difference between the 685 and the 695,sometimes it is to do with the accessory they come with dictate the model number,coffee time no i have seen today it is the same power 1350w because i have received one so i still do not know why there are two different reference for the same product,the ec695 ha more power 1450w instead of 1350w for the ec685 otherwise they are the same,nice video just one question are you pressing the one cup button or the doble cup i have the same machine but sometimes i feel it is to much watery,i use the single cup button but i press it again when the right amount of coffee is reached you can also customise it to get le or more water a needed,did not even suspect there is a grinder that go with my dedica already ordered a sage smart pro though,there is a dedica grinder indeed but in my opinion you made a good choice with the sage smart pro more accurate,omg that little brush to wipe off the excess wa so important would have been nice to know which one of the 3 included cup work best for this machine,i use that little brush very often a coffee is sometimes hard to wipe off in some corner way much important than we could think,brad pitt on perfeto delonghi espresso wa filmed in greece,very nice video and setup love it,thank you very much,temperature setting at medium or high,set to high,hey nice video and set up have you already tried grinding the coffee with delonghi grinder on the finest setting and using bottomless filter to brew curious about the result i am wondering whether to by this grinder or invest into a hand one thanks in advance,the diva on the dedica grinder i use the finest setting 1 or 2 18 scale for a x2 cup i might be different than the breville though,coffee time would you please share your grind size number i am using the breville and can not seem to get the right grind to get a full two shot thanks,get a proper grinder and you would be good to go,i have seen a few people doing this it seems that they kinda enjoy it however bear in mind that this machine wa not built to accept a bottomless filter i am already brewing at the finest setting i am planning to buy maybe another machine in the future thanks for watching,espresso not expresso no hate fot this just saying wonderful setup amazing vibe love it i wish i will be able to open my small coffee bar one day,coffee time did not knew that d enjoy homie,it is written with an x in french but i agree i should have written with the letter s thank you for your comment,why i can not fill 14g in my double shot basket my maximum i found is about 12g if i want to close the portafilter in the machine,same problem,my dream coffee set up,excellent shot very aesthetic and surely tasting,great video where did you get that scale,this is the timemore coffee scale i bought it on aliexpress,my espresso seems to taste sour and the extraction time is below 25sec i set the dedica grinder setting to 1 and still havent improved anything,hi nice video i have the vintage model i have tried almost every bottomless basket around and turned back to original pressurised one eventually this machine are not meant to make non pressurised espresso look creame smeel is way better with non pressurised but taste awfull even whit a latte it is undrinkable for me i saw you want to try bottomless try it if you wish i suggest try 53mm 51 one are very bad quality and ha a conical shape tamper stucks or doe not fit a it go down but if you are really into making great espresso buy an official 58mm with a good grinder have a nice day,of course this machine can make a non pressurised espresso and a good one at that you just do not know what your doing,coffee time to progress nothing better than to change the machine but this one is still excellent when you want to make a good coffee quite easily,thank you for your comment to be honest i am still hesitating wether i should buy a non pressurised filter or not better use it a it is i am also considering buying a new machine thanks for the tip have a great day,nice video but i see your carefully prepared puck ha absolutely hit the shower screen causing uneven extraction better dose 10 to 12 gram and check for the right amount of clearance between the puck and screen,hi mate i have the same machine can you please able to tell how did you achieve exactly 26 second with 38 out it just perfect i am grinding 14g and it pours quite a lot and overtime awesome video thank you,imola szasz i think it is,j junior tamp harder for pressurized is not it the other way around,with non pressurized basket just tamp a little harder when using a non pressurized basket first program the water amount by pressing and holding the button you want to program until you get 25sec thats how it becomes consistent,art by tdr thanks you too,imola szasz thank you for your advice i did end up buying bottomless filter and various bean a well n now am on my way of experimenting with different roast bean with a perfect shot thank you and enjoy your coffee,throw away pressurized basket and buy classical one on aliexpress for example with it you can pull real espresso not ex,replace the original portafilter with some crap sold on aliexpress just because it is the fashion not very smart if this machine wa made for a non pressurized filter it would be offered by delonghi if you really want a non pressurized filter you need to choose a machine that go with it,i am planning to buy one soon,hi there may i know what audio you used and camera for a more focused point of view like what you did there thanks if you could share,hi i have a fujifiulm xt3 camera and i used the built in microphone to record the audio thanks for watching,u need to wake up 5 hour before job to make all this operation,it take a bit of time but i do it in about 2 minute every morning,did you mod the grinder for finer grind,no it is the standard grinder,i would suggest to pay dollar10 and get non pressurized basket and dial in your grind after that a you clearly have the skill and the mean for it although i suspect you have already tried it given your setup,yes sir i am planning to buy a non pressurised portafilter soon thanks for watching,nice may i ask why i come out 65g espresso from 14g bean and the espresso is sour did you press 1 cup button,coffee time thanks,i personalised the amount of water for a double shot i press the 2 cup button i recommend you to stop the shot in order to get the amount of coffee you like according the coffee ratio you want for example if you like 1 2 ratio you start with 14g of coffee and you stop the shot at around 28g of coffee do not let the machine till the end a it may be too long that is probably why your coffee is sour,very pleasing video to watch i like the aesthetic a lot for your coffee setup i would hightly highly recommend some modification 1 get an unpressurized basket or even better a new bottomless portafilter 2 unfortunately you will have to get a new grinder the kg521 can not grind fine enough to produce a decent espresso maybe some super dark roasted bean might work but you will be very limited 3 weight after grinding unless you get a single dose grinder you lost 2 6g this way the kg521 ha a lot of dead space 4 you want to have a ratio around 1 1 5 1 2 5 of dose to espresso in the cup e g 14g should give you 28g coffee and when timing i would aim for a little slower because of the pre infusion time of the ec695 5 before making the first coffee always do an empty run without the portafilter installed of water into you cup the temperature of the water after turning on the machine will otherwise be too inconsistent and it also help with cleaning the machine and the water pre heat your cup 6 optional if you want to make any milk based drink you should replace the panarello wand an intermediate solution is to just take the panarello off and lock the plastic wand below into place using a zip tie the panarello can not produce microfoam you will always get too fluffy big bubbely milk,jacob archibald true another option i can recommend if you do not mind the little bit of extra effort is a good quality manual grinder i am using a 1zpresso jx pro and loving it you get perfect single dosing with no retention for dollar160 which otherwise would cost you way way more than dollar300,start with the bottomless filter and see what you can do without upgrading your grinder i got a bottomless portafilter for my dedica arte for dollar35 and i wa using a pretty cheapo oxo conical burr grinder i got for free and on it is finest grind i wa pulling decent shot that being said if you want to upgrade your grinder a good intermediate option is the breville smart grinder pro dollar200 a compared to a lot of people recommending dollar350 option that really are not necessary for the average user,sebastian maurer thank you so much for the knowledge i will practice it soon,hau oh also all those time and ratio are just theoretical guideline make sure to taste the coffee if you get an awesome result but it take longer or shorter than the thheoretical value do not change it the taste is the important thing and not 1 2 or 30 second etc,hau you might have to increase it slightly but i would just adjust one variable at a time so maybe grind finer and see where you end up with how long the extraction take and the ratio you get and than adjust from there if your ratio dropped after grinding finer increase the time etc,science and coffee combined yes please excellent video,expresso it is like an espresso but faster,,first perfect video dude i have the same espresso machine and i want to combine it with the same grinder my question is can the grinder cut the coffee so thin that i can put the basket without pressure or doe he just want his own factory basket to what extent do you cut the coffee now i work the basket without pressure and with this i would like to continue but of course i have the other one thank you very much for the video,vincent chen do you still have that grinder i wa looking to buy one but i am a little concerned about the longevity of it,do not buy this grinder there is no way it can make proper espresso way to coarse i purchased about 3 month ago tried for about 3 day then i returned it for refund do not waste your money if you looking for a grinder for espresso i would suggest breville smart pro grinder for espresso fine enough for a decent cup of espresso,get a enzoo grinder and calibrate it to finer setting i got tiger strip on my espresso by doing this that is the best cheap option the grinder in the video is not mean for unpressurize basket,do not buy this grinder if you want to pull unpreassured shot it is way to coarse i even tried to mod it so it can grind finder but it still isnt enough maybe look at the sage grinder dose controll pro or smart grinder pro,thanks for your comment for my purpose the grinder is an amazing deal and it doe a good job for a pressurised basket i am planning to buy a non pressurised basket soon and i will try it i have seen people on the internet using it with a non pressurised basket and it seems to work well even if it is not the best you can put any basket you want in this grinder 51mm i usually use the finest grind size 1 for a single shot expresso and size 2 for a double expresso shot scale from 1 to 18 on the grinder,nice video can i ask for the name of the shot cup thanks guy,the cup wa given with my coffee machine however you can find them on this website french coffee website i guess you can find it also on amazon aliexpress,pretty sure you lost around 1 gram of coffee inside of the grinder it more accurate to weight 14 g out of the grinder and not full bean to get the exact brew ratio to repeat it every morning,it wa the first time i wa making coffee now i weight the portafilter out of the grinder and not the bean before it change a lot indeed i will make another video soon thanks for watching,bamskriewoel,did you use 1 cup or 2 cup filter my ec685 wa brewing 14g of coffee for 50 second how do you get only 26 second of extracting,haha 50 second what a troll mine doe for 10 second for 26 second i would have 100ml of water out,stas orliuk what 50 second mine in 10 second,coffee time will try thanks,i used the 2 cup filter i slightly level the coffee with the distribution tool and a it is a pressurised portafilter i do not tamper too hard just a bit i would suggest you to grind coarser and also tamper le,thanks what kind of coffee distribution tool do you use,i bought it on amazon here is the link,very esthetic setup but please throw out the pressure basket and get unpressured basket your grind size is also way to coarse the extraktion is way to fast,thank you for the input bear in mind that wa my first attempt at making coffee a i received the machine the day before i will buy a non pressurised basket in the future for sure thanks for watching,all that withva pressurized basket change you basket bro,tous en marche lapavoni c est pour le ristreto et au pire de ca expresso mais tr s belle pi ce,hatim daoudi ah oui c est un tr s bon matos tu doi te faire plaisir c est clair que quand on a le bon mat riel et le comp tences passer au non pressuris change absolument tout perso au niveau de la machine j ai une la pavoni depuis l ann e derni re mais je regrette un peu car m me si le design est superbe la technologie reste vachement d pas e haha avec le levier et tout mais a n emp che pa de faire un ristretto de malade mental le moulin c est kinu m47 un 100 percent manuel,libre pour l instant j utilse une saeco picobaristo hd8925 ca va dure a trouver le non grain et une gaggia baby calss avec moulin mdf la plus de libert le rendement est incomparable,hatim daoudi if you drink high quality freshly ground coffee you can have excellent result with a pressurized filter i have not tried that filter with that machine but have worked in the manufacture of coffee machine,more disgusting than pressurised if yiu tested it i believe in you than,grind size,i usually use the finest grind size between 1 and 3 scale from 1 to 18 on my grinder,nice coffee table setup there,superbe

14,ihr k nnt da 1 und 2 sieb durch einwandig siebeinsatz ersetzen achtung nur da 1 sieb passt ohne den kunstoff au dem siebtr ge auszubauen hier da video der kaffeemacher akademie amp r sterei delonghi dedica ec 685 espressomaschine unter 200 euro schmeckt der espresso der siebtr ger wurde von mir selbst gekauft der test ist unabh ngig vom hersteller bei dem link zu amazon handelt e sich um einen provision link,ist e empfehlenswert durch die einstellungen wasser zu bohne einen kaffee au der maschine zu erhalten ich bin am berlegen mir eine siebtr germaschiene anzulegen trinke aber auch mal gerne einen kaffee,kann ich bei der delonghi dedica auch einfach einen langen kaffee beziehen also da wasser einfach solange laufen lassen bi eine normale tasse voll ist,andre mafemi,wird gemacht,cool danke f r den test und auch die noch kommenden eine esspressomaschine such ich auch noch stell doch bitte auch den anderen reinigungsaufwand gegen ber wa mus ausgebaut werden und wa nicht und auch ein hinweis auf plastik oder aluminium im wasser kaffeekreislauf find ich wichtig f r die entscheidung ich suche nach weder kunststoff noch alu aber da ist sehr schwer zu finden,i need your help please which one is better the gastroback piccolo or dedica,not a bad machine i have the same one for 3 year amp still going strong no wonder why it is still in the market,hallo ich bin eher ein teetrinker anstatt kaffetrinker allerdings habe ich einen kaffee gefunden der mir unheimlich lecker schmeckt e ist kein kaffee in dem sinne e sind ger stete und gemahlenen lupinen cafe pino jetzt wollte ich nachfragen wei hier vielleicht jemand bescheid ob man diesen lupinenkaffee auch mit diesem siebtr ger von delonghi verwenden kann auf der verpackung von cafe pino steht das e geht man nur 2 3 weniger vom kaffee nehmen sollte ich bereit ihn derweil mit einem italienischen espressokocher zu habe genau diesen kaffe aber bei meiner freundin au einer gro en vollautomatischen espressomaschine getrunken von delonghi die um die 800 euro gekostet hat getrunken und der geschmack hat mich absolut umgehauen da ich aber kein kaffeetrinker bin da letzten mal richtigen kaffee vor 20 jahren vielleicht getrunken habe m chte ich auch keine 800 euro investieren deswegen dachte ich mir ich frage hier mal nach vielleicht hat jemand ne pers nliche erfahrung mit cafe pino und diesem ger t hier lg,ich habe da l chlein aufgebohrt auf 10 mm da passt auch dann mus man nat rlich den kaffee so fein mahlen das er in der richtigen geschwindigkeit durchl uft wenn man da zu fein macht dann schafft die maschine da nicht da rohr zum aufsch umen mus richtig fest oben eingerastet sein da ist schwierig und l st sich gern aber man kann leckeren cappuccino machen,kann man damit nut espresso machen gibt e siebtr ger maschinen die klein sind und auch normalen kaffee machen,hallo super video ich wollte mal fragen wie du den wasser druck eingestellt hast hast du den druck auf hoch oder niedrig lg maxime,sie ist nicht billig sondern g nstig,delonghi dedica,hallo arne kannst du oder einer in der gruppe sagen ob da bundle eckg 6821 mit kaffem hle f r neueinsteiger wa taugt vielen dank gru juen,hab da teil schon lange und bin super zufrieden damit,habt ihr auch manchmal da problem da kein kaffee kommt reicht der druck da nicht au oder woran kann da liegen,bei mir auch ist auch schon die zweite die ich habe aber sehr robust und zuverl ssig,klasse video ich habe die maschine verfr hrt zu weihnachten bekommen ende der woche hole ich sie mir ab und freue mich ein wenig zu testen danke f r die tipps auch von den kaffeemachern war da video ebenso sehr empfehlenswert,m glich auch normalen cafe 300ml zu trinken,ich habe die maschine vor gut 3 monaten geschenkt bekommen ich benutze sie nur 1 mal t glich jetzt wundere ich mich das die warntaste f r die entkalkung schon blinkt laut wasserwerk haben wir hier in hagen nrw weiches wasser ob da wohl jemand hnliche erfahrung hat,hallo zusammen ich w rde mir diese maschine zum einstieg in die welt der siebtr ger gerne zulegen vor allem weil die krups virtuoso im moment nirgends lieferbar ist meine fragen nun vorab mus man zwingend frisch gemahlenen kaffee verwenden oder kann man schon vorgemahlenen kaffee verwenden kann man mit der maschine auch einen lungo zubereiten oder nur espresso freue mich auf eure tip,hey super danke f r da video mich w rde nur mal interessieren inwiefern e wirklich relevant ist keinen vorgemahlenen kaffe zu nehmen liegt e an dem mahlgrad da da dieser verstopfen k nnte oder da kaffepulver zu stark mit durchl uft oder ist e nur ein geschmacklicher unterschied vielen dank,da aroma geht bei gemahlenem kaffee viel schneller verloren daher lohnt e sich darauf zu achten das man siebtr ger und mahlwerk einzeln kauft man hat so einfach l nger freude am siebtr ger sch ne abend,habe bohnen f r einen vollautomaten kann e daran liegen das da wasser immer im siebtr ger stehen bleibt und nicht durchl uft wie kann ich sie am besten aufstellen so das sie beim siebtr ger einsetzen und herausnehmen nicht immer verrutscht also ich mus sagen ich finde e krass das du hier immer darauf herumreitest das e eine g nstige maschine sei also ich finde 150 200 euro f r eine einfache espressomaschine f r zu hause alles andere al g nstig,ich liebe deine video und lerne ganz viel ber die kaffeemaschinenwelt d,wa machine vibrating like a pulse while steaming milk mine doe,mine too i guess it count the second you need to make the foam i always count to 60,wichtig ist aber doch auch wie erreiche ich den kundendienst,da teil is top seit ber 2 jahren treuer begleigter und super kaffee davor jura saeco etc schweineteure kaffemaschinen die st ndig kaputt waren nach garantie hin ber gegangen sind und st ndig geputzt werden m ssen da teil gibts f r 150euros und l uft und l uft f r da geld einer jura kann man sich 8 von denen kaufen und hat besseren kaffee w rde ich jederzeit wieder kaufen,kenobi habe keine benutze nur gemahlenen kaffee allerdings soll die passende de longhi dedica m hle nicht schlecht sein,hi wa f r ne m hle hast du zu der maschine gekauft,klasse video ich habe da problem das mein milchschaum total explodiert und berkochen will mus st ndig wieder ausmachen wa mache ich falsch hat jemand noch da problem,nachdem ist die erste tasse kaffe habe m chte ich f r meine partnerin die zweite tasse kaffe machen aber der erste knop 1 tasse 2 tasse und zweite knopf blinkt st ndig und fu ktioniert nicht wa ist zu tun,du redest zuviel komm bitte zum punkt,wenn ich mehr auf caffee crema stehe statt espresso w rdet ihr diese maschine empfehlen oder soll ich lieber einen vollautomaten nehmen,hallo hat jemand erfahrung mit verbranntem kaffee au dieser maschine,anstatt billig w rde ich hier lieber g nstig anwenden,passt in der delonghi dedica auch ein 3er sieb,ich h tte mich gefreut wenn der kaffee auch getrunken worden w re um zu beurteilen ob die g nstige maschine leckeren espresso machen kann weil da ist e doch eigentlich worauf e ankommt,kann hier jemand eventuell au eigener erfahrung sagen wie da mit der langlebigkeit der maschine aussieht,ich hab diese maschine seit 1 jahr t glich in betrieb und bin soweit sehr zufrieden damit seit einiger zeit tropft sie jedoch st ndig vor und nach der kaffee zubereitung und da garnicht wenig hat jemand erfahrung mit diesem problem,schiggysan danke f r den tipp werd ich mir merken nach einem 2 fachen entkalkungsvorgang funktioniert sie jetzt zum gl ck aber wieder sehr brav,einmal einen reset durchf hren kann helfen,bei mir h rts gar nt mehr auf zu blinken bei den tassen lol,servus ich suche ein kaffee vollautomat der nicht au kunstoff ist da e krebs eregelt ist welche modelle w rdest du mir entfehlen,welche milch eignet sich am besten zu aufsch umen,h milch 1 5 percent,welche farbe ist da eigentlich m sieht online viel heller au schwarz ist online richtig schwarz,da ist die schwarze also bk hab die gleiche,kannst du mir sagen ob die neue krups virtuoso baugleich ist mit der delonghi bzw ob du die neue krups demn chst testen wirst finde da krups design etwas sch ner aber hat man bei ihr nachher da gleiche gute ergebnis sonst w rde ich al einsteiger doch die delonghi nehmen,hy welche maschine hast du denn nun genommen wie schmeckt dein kaffee espresso,danke sehr informativ und ein sympathischer pr senter,wie schmeckt denn der kaffee die wichtigste frage f r mich,nach kaffee beste antwort,nach kaffee,da wa du gemacht hast ist die k hlfunktion der maschine einfach auf heisses wasser drehen und warten bi kein dampf mehr rauskommt danach kann man direkt weiter machen,hi die 15bar pumpendruck sind nicht relevant gegen ber der getesteten gastroback mit 19bar,im wohnzimmer steht bei un die jura f8 tft und in meinem hobbyraum eine nespress o gran lattissima lohnt sich die anschaffung der dedica ec685 ich trinke 3 4 kaffee am tag der kaffee mit dem teuren siebtr ger im restaurant meiner frau schmeckt um welten besser al mit der jura und nespresso schmeckt der kaffee mit der delonghi auch so gut wie mit einem teuren siebtr ger,sehr informativ da hat mir bei meiner kaufentscheidung f r meine erste siebtr ger geholfen,1 die espresso siebtr germaschine delonghi ec 685 kostet derzeit zwischen 159euros rot und 194euros schwarz und ist damit nicht billig sondern h chstens preiswert da wort billig ist in jeden fall ein abwertender begriff und sollte au dem deutschen wortschatz gestrichen werden billig wirkt die ec 685 auf jeden fall nicht hat sie doch ein vollmetall geh use die doppelten siebe sind durchdacht weil trennbar und dadurch hygienisch einwandfrei zu reinigen ganz im gegensatz zu weitaus teureren modellen anderer hersteller wo die doppelwandigen siebe sich nicht trennen lassen und sich deshalb auch nicht einwandfrei reinigen lassen die ec 685 ist und bleibt eine durchdachte sehr gute und preiswerte espresso siebtr germaschine wa man bem ngeln k nnte w re der einschalttaster und die geringe w rme der tassenablage hier ist z b eine severin ka 5995 um l ngen besser beheizt,zum thema billig und generell abwertend nein sicher nicht im zweifel hilft da ein blick in einen betagten duden 8 au einer zeit in der sprache noch unaufgeregt und keinem beleidigungs und genderwahn verfallen war billig steht neben preiswert dabei unter anderem auch f r recht wa bei etwaiger streichung au dem wortschatz gleich mitentfiele nicht jede m gliche negative konnotation mus immer zwingend auch so gemeint sein selbst diskriminieren zugegeben mit starker tendenz zum negativen kann auch einfach nur unterschiedlich behandeln bedeuten,hallo hast du eine idee warum der knopf f r die milch auf zu sch umen nach wie vor

magnifica ecam 22 110 b automat frisch gemahlen und automatik w r nicht schlecht aber die kompromisse beim mahlwerk und der automatik espresso qualit t sind wahrscheinlich so hoch das bei vorgmahlenem

jonas ein gesicht,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,mus mann nach 2 caff maschine au machen damit ich noch 2 machen kann weil e klappt bei mir nicht ohne die au zu machen,nein bei meiner kann ich einfach nacheinander espressi machen ohne auszuschalten,ich hab mir einfach einen ersatz siebtr ger f r die dedica mitbestellt kostenpunkt 19euros und man kann den tr ger auf flexen ohne theoretisch die gew hrleistung zu riskieren so kann man auch 2 varianten benutzen einmal ganz offen und einmal wie e einige auch machen einfach da plastikteil innen beschneiden so kann man auch 2 espressi tassen mit den anderen graef sieben machen oder ebend die h bsche variante mit offenem sieb d,this machine is x100 louder,sehr sympatisch und lieb danke,1 60 2,,hey super video und sehr informativ welche farbe hast du ist da die schwarze oder die silbernen viele gr e,hallo sehr sch ne video habe die maschine seit ein paar tagen selber habe nur da problem das der espresso zu d nn wird und nicht richtig cremig ist keine barista typischer espresso und oft hat e auch einen metallischen geschmack hast du einen tipp f r mich w re sehr froh dr ber denn eigentlich habe ich mich sehr auf die maschine gefreut vg patrick,toastieboy999 hi toastieboy wasser nehme ich die au flaschen wa wir trinken aber habe tat chlich mehr pulver genommen klappt jetzt besser aber da metallische geschmack wenn nicht vor nicht leer br he kommt trotzdem,pat d vielleicht zu harte wasser oder zu wenig kaffeepulver,hervorragendes praxinahes video ich m chte mir eine kaffeem hle ersparen und trinke sehr gerne kaffee von illy kann da ger t mit dem espresso von illy verwendet werden passt der mahlgrad beim gemahlenen espresso der fix und fertig in der dose zu kaufen ist,geht e auch wenn ich espresso von segafredo kaufe und in die vorrichtung gebe habe keine m hle,kann jemand etwas zur de longhi ec31 21 berichten scheint mir ziemlich identisch zur dedica zu sein oder gibt e gravierende unterschiede,die maschine ist spitze besitze sie selbst genialer espresso,i can pick some word here and there but comprehension is nought did you say the steam wand froth the milk beautifully i am glad to see domestic espresso machine can finally pour a good shot do you think you could re edit this review include a cappuccino in a clear glass so we can see how well the steam wand froth it looked like there wa some extra density to the milk when you poured it but i am not sure thanks,it take a bit of practice but yes you can do good froth that can even be used for latte art,hallo arne ich will mir eben diese maschine kaufen trinke aber lieber normalen kaffee al espresso ist e m glich mit dieser maschine kaffee zu br hen wenn ja wie w rdest du da machen lg,ich habe die maschine und sie kann da thema kaffeesorte habe ich noch nicht klar au erdem jetzt ist im angebot,eine frage die taste mit zwei tassen ist f r zwei espressi,danke sehr sympathisch und gut erkl rt wir klicken un gleich mal durch bei dir,sehr gut erkl rt,wa ist denn mit dem wichtigsten kriterium der geschmack,maximilian frey der h ngt eher gering von der maschine ab auch teure machen am ende nur espresso mit dem selben prinzip dann halt mit konstanteren ergebnissen und mehr beeinflussbaren parametern f r den geschmack mus man eher den richtigen kaffee kaufen m glichst frisch selber mahlen und den richtigen mahlgrad herausfinden so das der durchfluss am ende passt,die maschine erinnert mich stark an eine nespresso maschine,ich bekmme sie demn chst geschenkt ich habe allerdings die baratza encore m hle die ja f r espresso nich gut geeignet sein soll keine erfahrung da ich nur handfilter oder french press trinke aber ich glaube f r meine verh ltnisse wird da reichen und da mit dem doppelten boden joa is halt so ich bin da eh kompletter einsteiger ich denke da ich keinen vergleic hab werd ich gut mit klarkommen warscheinlich noch prahlen das e der beste espresso der welt is d,hab die gleiche m hle und bei nem kumpel seine zeichens barista mit einer 2000euros ecm siebtr germaschine benutzt also meine kommt locker bi 5 runter mehr musste nicht sein zumindest bei dem kaffee den wir getestet haben ich hab mit ihm vorher die m hle getestet um zu gucken ob ich beides brauche d aber e hat gut funktioniert ich hatte die m hle auch eher f r filterkaffee gekauft,dank,hi mich w rde interessieren ob die siebtr ger der delonghi modelle untereinander kompatibel sind du hast ja soweit ich wei auch die la specialista getestet k nnstest du mal testen ob deren siebtr ger bei der ec685 passt danke schonmal,okay da ist schade vielen dank f r die schnelle antwort,die sind sicher nicht kompatible,eckspressoo wird deutscher nie kapieren,ich liebe den hemd,habe die maschine seit 1 jahr wegen immer wieder auftretender probleme bei den siebtr gereins tzen wurde die maschine miitlerweile mehrmals zur reparatur eingeschickt nach ca 20 eins tzen waren die siebe trotz sofortiger reinigung nach jeder nutzung verstopft und e kam kein espresso durch den siebtr ger wa kann ich dagegen tun danke,gerhard b jau alles ok ich hab noch einen ersatz siebtr ger bestellt und den wie bei den kaffeemachern aufgeflext plus graef sieb echt super einstieg erste sahne man darf nicht vergessen das e dann mehr zu einem handwerk wird ich hab auch schon schlechte espressi gezogen aber zum anf nger learning kann ich die kaffeemacher video empfehlen,marco zimmer hast du deine maschine zwischenzeitlich im einsatz klappt alles,hab bei rezensionen der maschine mal gelesen da e einige mit einem software reset in den griff bekommen haben bzw werkseinstellungen danach wieder so einstellen wie vorher die software kommt wohl durcheinander oder so also da nicht unbedingt da sieb verstopft ist sondern die pumpe meint nicht mehr voll arbeiten zu m ssen keine ahnung wie e bei ihnen ist k me auf einen versuch an habs nicht getestet meine kommt morgen erst d,hallo michael sorry habe deine antwort erst heute gefunden danke habe mein problem dadurch gel st indem ich die er ffnung am boden ge ffnet habe steht ja wohl auch so in der bedienungsanleitung zum siebtr gereinsatz wenn ich die abbildung richtig interpretiert habe seitdem geht e fein gemahlener espresso bzw festes tempern habe da thema bei mir nicht l sen k nnen der service von de longhi war mir nicht wirklich hilfreich da ist noch viel viel luft nach oben,herzlichen dank f r den tollen test ich denke die kleine maschine passt perfekt zu meiner baratza sette 30ap die ich mir nach eurem video letztes jahr gekauft habe ich werde mal dar ber nachdenken,,leider keinen zucker auf crema vom espresso gelegt dann kann man auch nicht erkennen wie schnell der zucker einsinkt oder wie standhaft die crema ist bei den folgetests sollte man bei der crema den zuckertest machen die nummer am morgen da hat man bereits den kaffee auf,kann man damit auch eine tasse kaffee machen,tinyentropy 1 schritt nur hei e wasser beziehen ohne den siebtr ger einzuspannen je nach gew nschter st rke dazu die taste f r 1 oder 2 espresso dr cken 2 schritt siebtr ger einspannen und doppelten espresso beziehen nennt sich glaube ich americano mir schmeckt e am besten mit hei em wasser f r 1 espresso und dann 2 espresso drauf,womit bekomme ich denn bei der delonghi so einen cafe creme hin,tinyentropy dazu habe ich hier ein video gemacht viele gr e,danke aber wie funktioniert da dann bei einem kaffeevollautomaten,daf r w rde ich lieber eine filtermaschine nutzen,hi kann der wasser auch zur seite rausgezogen werden und eingesetzt werden oder nur von oben wa e unm gich machen w rde die maschine unter k cheneinbauschr nke zu nutzen danke,hab die maschine hier selbst stehen und mann mus den tank 3 5 centimeter nach oben ziehen damit er au der halterung raus ist soviel platz mus er also haben,danke f r da informative video und die verlinkungen welche m hle benutzt du,ich habe einige m hlen in diesem fall habe ich diese genutzt,are you from germany,ja,hallo bin relativ verwirrt normal sollte der kaffee ja immer 25sek durchlaufen mit dem 1er und mit dem 2er sieb da heisst aber auch das ich die 1er fase und auch die 2er taste genau gleich programmiere von der zeit richtig beim 2er sieb geht dann einfach nur mehr wasser durch sollten dann so 50 60 ml sein oder lieg ich komplett falsch,wenn man kaffees von aldi kauft ausreichend f r etwa 2 monate dann fangen die probleme an geschweige den man m chte mehr al nur einen kaffe machen qualit t l sst schon nach dem ersten br hvorgang nach und wird nicht besser wegen der temperatur der maschine,if not having a single wall filter is a no go for some people they should not even be looking at espresso machine in this price range the grind is so crucial for a single wall filter and unless for some weird reason you have a grinder 2 3x more expensive than this espresso machine it is very unlikely you will ever get the grind fine and consistent enough for a single wall that is exactly why these entry level machine come with double wall filter to allow for a coarser inconsistent badly tamped grind which most people will have at home tl dr if you are a coffee snob that refuse to drink from a double wall filter stop looking at euros160 espresso machine,themrvengeance actually yes but only occasionally and btw a the dedica only hold about 14g it take around 80 100 second to grind that amount but i think the red clix for the commandante will be important long term at least for dialing in espresso even more precisely i am considering getting it my main pro for the commandante is the retention which can not even be beat by the niche or sette it is not even close,leoniden do you have any experience with electric grinder or did you go straight for the commandante manual grinder are cool but i really hate having to go through a 5 minute arm work out while friend wait for coffee,themrvengeance not really i paid 130 for the machine 20 for the basket so it is 150 meanwhile the grinder is about 200 all in euro from my unsophisticated opinion one should prioritize in the following fashion good bean gt grinder gt machine of further importance is the water which in my case is really mediocre also what doe an espresso machine ha to provide water pressure and pre infusion is fine on the delonghi so are the single walled filter basket only concern is temperature stability which is rather mediocre otherwise this think can with some modification make decent espresso and is fine for espresso snob cheap student espresso snob at least,leoniden jesus that grinder is like twice the price of the whole espresso machine,i use the machine a it is my first espresso machine with the graef 1457222 single wall filter and a commandante c40mk3 it is not too bad,danke f r verlinken arne liebe gr sse au m nchenstein,ich erhalte die maschine heute dank eurer video bin ich schon gut gewappnet ist ja echt eine wissenschaft ihr erkl rt da aber alle richtig fantastisch vielen dank faf r bisher mit edelstahl herdk nnchen am start bin mal gespannt,coffeeness kann ich nur zur ck geben sch nen tag dir,gerne ich verweise immer gerne auf so

empfehlungen zwischen stufe 9 11 l uft der kaffee 14g f r doppelten espresso bei mir nur tropfenweise und extrem langsam durch oder kann e noch andere gr nde daf r au er dem mahlgrad geben liebe gr e,hast du schon mal den sage ses500 getestet e w re interessant zu wissen ob e gegen den ec685 ankommen w rde oder gar besser w re,ein vergleich der beiden maschinen bzw da video zur sage ses500 bambino plus w rde mich auch sehr interessieren ich habe die sage ses500 bambino plus gerade zusammen mit der sage scg600 the dose control kaffeem hle f r 300 euro erworben und frage mich ob da wa taugt ausprobiert habe ich beide maschinen noch nicht da ich berlege diese vielleicht zur ckzuschicken,ja da video dazu kommt auch bald,kannst du mir verraten wa f r einen kaffee du da verwendest danke,cooles video wird e irgendwann ein video zum sage oracle touch geben w rde mich brennend interessieren,hier schon mal der test au meinem blog,hab da teil seit zwei jahren und leider schon zweimal bei der reparatur gehabt zweimal hat ein ventil wurde mir gesagt zu singen begonnen und die maschine wurde ziemlich laut dann funktionierte wieder alles normal bi da ger t wieder zu singen begonnen hat leider bin ich jetzt schon au der garantie raus und mus da teil jetzt wohl selbst aufschrauben wom glich ein montagsger t sonst ist der siebtr ger echt nicht schlecht f r den preis die gr f cm800 passt perfekt dazu habe ich auch im einsatz,da habe ich zumindest bisher noch nicht geh rt ja ich finde auch da die gr f cm800 sehr gut passt,probier mal bitte die wmf siebzr germaschine,danke f r den hinweis die kann ich noch garnicht,ist der geschmack denn sp rbar besser al bei einem vollautomaten,kommt darauf an wa du f r kaffee benutzt und wie du die menge und wasserh rte einstellst habe die dedica seit 2 jahren und bin soweit damit zufrieden pflege ist bei der maschine da a und o f r mich ist da wa die maschine raus l sst mehr al zufriedenstellend,coffeeness ich habe mir jetzt den nachfolger der ecam22110 den 21116 aufgrund deiner test gekauft gerade der test ganz teuer gegen ganz g nstig hat mich sehr von der magnifica s berzeugt danke daf r,da w rde ich so generell nicht unterschreiben,mit dem vorg nger fing meine reise an habe damals die siebe aufgedremelt und eine graef cm800 gekauft da war 2015 vier jahre sp ter steht nun eine rocket mozzafiato evo r samt rocket fausto in der k che mal sehen wieviele jahre bi zur r9 linea mini samt mahlk nig k30 vergehen,sunshine bin inzwischen auf eine synchronika umgestiegen die mozza macht nun aber meinen bruder gl cklich,bist du zufrieden mit rocket,i tested mine at the hottest water setting and could not get better than obtained 78c which is not really sufficient for a short expresso the milk temp is by the way comfortably sufficient for a good cappucino or latte very good video from you vielen danken,da h re ich so oft cool freut mich level up,diesmal siebtr ger ausm yps heft d,haha,de longhi espressomaschine ec9335 m la specialista,sema in dem fall kommst du ums lesen nicht herum ich selbst habe eine bezzera matrix,coffeeness hast du auch ein video vom testen gemacht habe e n mlich nicht gefunden ansonsten w re ich dir dankbar wenn du mir sagen k nntest welches du f r deinen t glichen gebrauch privat benutzt,gibt e im coffeeness blog delonghi la specialista espressomaschine hybrid f r engagierte amp gewohnheitstiere,teste mal bitte diesen wenn du den zu percent empfiehlst kaufe ich e,wo ist denn der kollege von fr her,coffeeness ja,ja logisch,der steht nicht vor sondern hinter der kamera soll ich ihm mal wieder mitmachen lassen,endlich mal wieder siebtr ger maschinen ich wollte mir eine sage barista express kaufen wa h ltst du davon und wird die auch getestet,coffeeness danke noch mal f r den schnellen link ich werde mir wohl diese maschine kaufen freue mich das ich deinen kanal gefunden habe,danke,hier findest du meinen test im blog,danke f r da video und ich bin gespannt auf die anderen siebtr ger oder vollautomaten,danke bald geht e weiter,hi die dedica war auch meine erste espressomaschine mit der graef cm800 ein g nstiger einstieg in die espressozubereitung wem da t fteln am espresso und cappuccino liegt der wird relativ schnell auf eine qualitativ hochwertigere maschine wechseln aber ja man bekommt auch einen guten espresso und mit viel bung latteart f higen milchschaum hin die dampflanze mus zum s ubern komplett abmontiert werden da bei mir durch reines dampfen noch milch im plastikendst ck verblieben ist ein weiterer nachteil ist da plastik in dem auffangbeh lter und dem siebtr ger selbst da sich nicht so leicht reinigen l sst und auf dauer nicht mehr so sch n anzusehen ist ich kann die maschine jedem empfehlen der ab und zu einen espresso oder cappuccino trinkt wer gerne und viel kaffee trinkt oder gerne mit verschiedenen kaffeesorten experimentiert der wird mit dieser maschine nicht gl cklich,yankee mike hab mir die maschine bzw die 680 heute f r 50euros geholt und mus sagen das sie meine anspr chen an einen cappuccino durchaus erf llt f r eine gute m hle reicht die kohle nicht hole ich deshalb lieber regelm ig in der r sterei hier um die ecke,den auffangbeh lter au plastik kannst du in die sp lmaschine packen hab ich schon oft gemacht der h lt da zumindest bei mir au,coffeeness freu mich schon auf kommende video bin gespannt ob auch dualboiler mit pid control dabei sind bin zur zeit zwar super zufrieden mit meiner ecm mechanika iv und einer ceado e6p berlege aber ob sich ein umstieg auf eine maschine mit pid control lohnt,danke f r den tollen kommentar da kann ich alles so unterschreiben,soviel aufwand f r eine tasse espresso da bleib ich lieber bei filterkaffee optisch wirkt die maschine wie gewollt aber nicht gekonnt aber wem is gef llt,mein handfilter kaffee am morgen ist eigentlich mehr arbeit,die technik beim tampern ist schon interessant gru olaf,interessante herangehensweise,fand ich auch nicht schlecht haha,danke f r den testbericht ich hatte diese maschine prim r wegen ihrer gr e gekauft insbesondere die tiefe war hier entscheidend wenn nach m glichkeit doch mehr geld f r siebtr germaschinen investiert werden sollte welche kompakten empfehlenswerten ger te gibt e noch,coffeeness vielen dank,danke f r den kommentar die sage ses500 the bambino plus finde ich noch spannend zu der mache ich auch noch ein video den test im blog kannst du hier

tried change the temperature pressure and non pressure sieve different type of water i decalcified the coffee machine with the original preparation and also with vinegar i do not know where the mistake may be anymore can you please help me i am already desperate i own a delonghi dedica ec685 m coffee machine and a delonghi grinder kg521 m,how long doe the espresso take to go through if it is le than 25 second chance are high that the coffee you are using is too coarse and thus the espresso isnt properly extracted and sour,hello wondering if you have found the answer to your question what kind of bean are you using some bean have more sour note in them and lighter roast bean will tend to be more sour too so it may be the bean you are using,one more question how often do you need to descale the machine my descaling is coming up after i have 30 or 40 coffee,there is a factory preset where the descaler light will blink after x number of shot pulled i think it can be changed but i am not so sure,i am not a barista you know i am something of a scientist myself but i can tell that your procedure is not good at the beginning of the brewing you should get black coffee and afterwards brighter foamy coffee you should adjust the grinder finer and the tamping more pressure,thank you for your suggestion i will definitely try a finer grind,i have a question where can i buy this machine,hi i bought this from the mall you can check if there is a delonghi store in your country,the machine keep on blinking after you make a coffee how do you make another coffee after that do you need to restart the machine every time i am struggling to make multiple cup of coffee one after another,in deloghi is recommandations to make it cool down properly you have to make hot water until it stop and then it will make you coffee again,turn the steam wand tap back on to drain off the hot water steam machine will stop automatically once machine is at optimal temperature you can make 2 espresso before the cool down is needed,after heating the milk the machine is too hot to produce coffee it will cool down automatically when you turn the steamer on until water come out,3,,how many cup can it make per day,in the first instance it can produce 2 double espresso to make more espresso you then drain off the steam wand to lower the internal temperature and away you go again so it can make a many shot a the water tank can produce so 1liter tank 30 or 60ml shot so technically about 33single espresso but i guess water usage in machine etc will lower that but hell if your having 30 shot a day i would perhaps see a therapist hope that help,my one is making noice and nothing coming from the coffee whats wrong please help me thanks,hi i am not so sure maybe you can check the grind of your coffee one time i had mine too finely ground then nothing came out,,i wish i would seen this video before i would read the supplied and quite frankly difficult to understand and confusing manual thank you,delonghi is machine is very good i use magnifica s and it taste too good and i drink too much coffee the video wa very helpful with love from japan,coffee is life,did you use the single or double scoop basket,that is a cappuccino not a latte,actually it wa a latte the ratio wa latte milk wa steamed like in latte so no it is not a cappuccino it is a latte,qued un caf con leche jajajajaja,thank you i just got one and wa not quite sure how to use it properly,,the tamping is edit do not mind me i am a barista and i am really picky,i have a non modified dedica it is possible to make much better coffee than this not a great representation of the machine capability,anthonia o grind your own coffee to espresso grind 7grams for single 14grams for a double espresso pre heat the portafilter preheat your cup mug rotate and tamp your grind in the coffee basket with enough pressure and brew,please do you have any tip for how to get better coffee with a non modified normal dedica,glen sorry my mistake i read it a i have modified dedica because i previously watched a dedica video demonstration with a different sump filter,alexandro830131 no modification a said in my comment my point is much better result can be achieved than what is demonstrated in this video a far a modification go there is an abundance of video showing even better result with a few mod that i am not going to get into,what is the modification done would you like to explain thanks,love your video i have found a method that 100percent work on making a good foam of milk with using a timer,nice but i step procedure is wrong but still good,san nabili,sidney lim garantoza how much po,sm dept store,better espresso than what a dolce gusto produce,no way man coffee from the semi automatic espresso machine taste really good,sidney lim garantoza the same coffee from the semi automatic espresso machine beat all those pseudo capsule coffee machine,i think just the same,,worth it ba planning to buy especially this ecq na mukhang extended,binot thru online sa delonghi mismo open na yung store nila sa vertis nodth medyo matrabaho like measuring and tamping pero masaya naman especially kung gusto mo magpractice ng latte art sa coffee mo yung medyo downside lang is yung descaling one month of usage kailangan na mag descale ng machine pero nung sumunod inabot na ng 3 month,eric blanco san po nabili kamusta namn after a few month hidni b nakakatamd gawin ung whole process,kevin nadela depende sa temperature ng froth mo pag above 65degc pang cappuccino na sya kung latte art dapat 65degc lang,kamusta po yung texture ng gatas ok naman po ba thanks,sidney lim garantoza at a local supermarket lang will order next week with together with a pitcher from delonghi though tempted din to buy a tamper haha bisyo na to,nice,sarap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,bambino 1 de longhi 0,it is fake crema anyway so it doe not really matter both are not worth the price if you are going to go cheap ust get the stilosa,i love the barsita she is so pretty and presented professionally,the drip tray come out for bigger cuos glass on the dedica also the dedica is 120 cheaper i have one and am more than happy with it,new video just launched with updated brewer comparison,nice review both shot are not amazing it is what you get for the price without dialing into the specific this look pretty genuine indeed portafilter grind issue etc et there is potential tho,we actually just redid this comparison with the new dedica arte coming soon and it turned out much better,rebecca is amazing i love her honesty and candor,kay,this is outdated why are not you using the delongi arte,because it did not exist at the time,the bambino is a beast for smaller espresso machine,can you programme the timing like for the dedica,no you can not,adding my voice to the dedica is cause i have had one for about five year at least 3 double espresso milk drink every day never needed repair so far bought a 3rd party bottomless and therefore non pressurised basket and holder grind my own coffee with a relatively cheap but good enough wellhome grinder consistently delicious shot plenty of crema i have the 680 so do not have the variable wand i believe the model demonstrated is the same a mine there is some technique to frothing milk and while i can not do latte art with what is produced i have a decent micro foam not the insane bubble bath a shown at it price point i feel the dedica is a good fit for anyone who want to take their coffee more seriously but is not ready to start weighing their dos you can pull a better shot on other machine but it is a big hike in price and it is more involved not saying anyone should not do this or indeed that i will not do this in the future but upon waking up the first thing i do is stumble over to the dedica and through my still half asleep haze throw together a flat white capuccino latte hybrid that beat the flavor of any chain coffee shop non pressurised bottomless basket holder bit of time getting the grind size right bit of time getting the extraction time right once you have got that set you will have delicious coffee in a very short amount of time with the least fuss,gen66 i am so sorry i did not get into weighing until after the dedica so i eyeballed the amount in and then had set the time to deliver the amount that i felt tasted best really sorry i can not help on this one what i would say is that the dedica can choke fairly easily so i would advise finding the grind size where it doe not choke and seems to be extracting well then go with 18g in 36g out and adjust the timing and thus the output until you are happy with the result setting your own time for output is a must though also i always used it on max heat setting,hi how many gram of coffee you put in your bottomless portafilter basket and how much coffee ml do you get out thank you,i love how honest she is maybe it is a canadian thing a there is a music store in toronto that doe review on digital piano and there are time that their salesman is like i do not really know who the target market for this instrument is most people would just buy the model above or below this one depending on the feature they needed or in the instance of the piano i own this action is heavier than anything i have ever played before digital or acoustic and it tire my hand after a little while which is true but i am used to it at this point and it is a great digital piano beyond that heavy action and rebecca here make me think of him a she reveals not just the cool feature but also the wart and perhaps even failure of the delonghi machine to be fair that is a pretty inexpensive machine so for the money it is not a bad value and their higher end equipment is nice,i have the delonghi and i have had it for about 3 year and i make about 2 to 3 double shot of espresso just about every day since i purchased it i can attest to the quality of the machine because it a workhorse and have never had to replace anything on it since the purchase i grind my own bean in a baratza sette 270i and i produce wonderful espresso with nice crema unlike what we saw in this video she did mention that she expected it to have been a better performance for this showdown so it is ok and for the frother if you use it all the time you will know your machine and how it froth and you can switch to steamed milk setting on the wand and work it manually like a traditional wand and produce thicker smoother froth on your milk i love my delonghi due to the quality and heartiness of my machine i think i would buy stinkin car made by them if they made one haha have a great day,same my delonghi doe not make espresso like this very misleading,about to leave a similar reply,100percent mine is 4 year old workhorse this woman doe not know how to use it if you press the steamer and wate for the light after you need to relase the water and than you can make the milk and no bubble,thanks rebecca enjoying viewing you i see that bambino is much better machine i saw other review dedica can get great creama shot,thanks for the review i would bought the bambino actually the bambino plus over the dedica but if i wanted to stay at or below dollar300 the bambino would be my choice,hi i recently purchased the bambino based on your review thanks btw however i can not seem to figure out how the mug warmer work for my bambino how do i activate the mug warmer,good life i recently bought the lelit mara x a an upgrade from the dedica lovely machine and i am getting great coffee from it but considering it is at least 4 time the price of the dedica i am not seeing that much of an upgrade to be fair the milk steaming is much better but for the price a dedica plus a bottomless filter and a decent grinder is very hard to beat,scrumpymanjack yes i do exactly the same warms the cup and the portafilter,scrumpymanjack thanks for the tip appreciate it,do not bother with the mug warmer just pour some hot water into your cup from the machine and through the portafilter and leave it sitting while you grind your coffee and prepare the portafilter dry the basket carefully before putting coffee in there though when you are ready to pour your shot pour out the hot water from you cup your cup will be hot,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear i see thank you,bambino or duo temp pro assuming i upgrade the portafilter and basket of the bambino,where can i find those glass cup that fit under the machine how tall are they i am having a hard time finding the correct height glass latte cup to fit under the breville bambino,depends where you live but they are all zwilling product we sell them in canada,it looked like you purposely tried to present dedica a an inferior performer i use this machine daily and i never had result like that and i am not a pro i am a newbie,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear good move thanks,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear looking forward to it,this seems pretty much our most questioned review so we will do it again and repost in a few week let is see how the second one come out,i do not think they actively tried to mislead people why would they long term doing thing like that come back at you and this company know that what seems clear is that they decided to do this review without knowing the machine a well a they should it wa sloppy and half hearted but not misleading on purpose,nicolas we do not try to scam anyone this wa the review a it wa by the person in our store that sell a tonne of delonghi and breville equipment we love delonghi and a mentioned prefer their equipment on a lot of front warranty in particular while i can find fault and wished she had done a second shot it wa unedited to favour one over the other,did you mean 8 inch high lol 8 ft high is super big,bigger is better right,nice thanks for this look like the bambino is a winner for small espresso machine,lol wait til the milk and foam separate in one and then compare it to the one just made to say it better,yeah watch until the 11min mark you still see the difference wtf,ikr atleast make the comparison fair,i wa just wondering about the breville bambino and i just came across your video a dedica user it is not a fair comparison honestly first of all you can put the long mug by removing the bottom tray of dedica your grind wa too fine in dedica that is why you could not get enough crema the milk heating can be adjusted in 2 different stage in dedica hot milk amp cappucino one is heating and giving smooth foam cappuccino setting is providing more foamy milk a you have shown,because she used dedica 680 not 685,thank you for this review i am an espresso novice and am looking for something with a small footprint that can make me a good latte a few time a week based solely on this information which product would you recommend,bambino or bambino plus for low cost
