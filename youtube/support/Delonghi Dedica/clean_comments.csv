right measure that is available with the machine then a press the coffee just a bit with the right tool however the machine doe not take any coffee i need to use le coffee than the right measure to take a coffee doe this happen to you guy any suggestion of what is happening thank you,if there is no coffee coming out it is possible that your coffee is ground too fine also make sure you use the correct portafilter there is 3 with the dedica 2 of them is for ground coffee 1 is for esa filter i do not use that but the with the other 2 the large one take 14 gram of coffee the single shot take 7grams hope this help then once you get into coffee you can buy an after market portafilter like in this video and play around with dosing grind etc,how could you make 38g of liquid in 30 second like that my dedica give 70g of liquid any setting need to be done,so it can pull decent and tasty shot at stock which coffee type brand do you find work the best with this machine,excellent my friend keep up the great work would love to know the original sound track used here very calming,it is cool but usually le is more is this something you really do everyday,curious why you would use your e685m when you have a lmm there,cuanta gilipolleces para tomar un caf,hi i have a question every one of my coffee is terribly sour every type of coffee is sour i tried change the temperature pressure and non pressure sieve different type of water i decalcified the coffee machine with the original preparation and also with vinegar i do not know where the mistake may be anymore can you please help me i am already desperate i own a delonghi dedica ec685 m coffee machine and a delonghi grinder kg521 m,have you tried different bean,you have the single shot button programmed a a double have you tried bottomless portafilter for the dedica and have you noticed the pump is not strong enough to get water through too finely ground bean on my breville grinder i have to do it about a 13 14 because if i go below an 11 the pump can not get any water through lol,this is the mo artly commercial i ever saw damn,5 min to make a coffee it a joke,why are you using a delonghi while standing next to a la marzocco,wait you have a marzocco and use a de longhi to make coffee,this is so satisfying,,,what is this soundtrack,como diria o saudoso casimiro mermao se esse maluco faz isso todo dia pra tomar um caf eu sou um chamyto,the temping is really uneven the way you do it,nice i love ur stye vinyl and coffee is also my mood i even bought vinyl player to match it up while taking a sip of my coffee,could you please share what song is playing in this video neither shazam nor audiotag recognize it edit found it here is the info for anyone else wanting to track it down song fascination performed by japanese mandolinist masao koga at first i thought it wa guitarist antonio koga album screen mood koga guitar romantica 1965 compilation of film music arranged by makoto saeki song originally written by fermo dante marchetti in 1905 record label nippon columbia jps 5024,i am learning i love coffe,hey im totally new into this with my delonghi 685 i just bought lavazza coffe bean caffe crema grinded it and put it into my portafilter i noticed that it very fluid and not really creamy what im doing wrong is this crema only given by using espresso bean,you might need to a grind finer b get a fresher bag of bean from the coffee store instead of supermarket,a question how did you change that steamer i bought a new one but the steamer is different,yes he changed it it is the rancilio silvia steamwand it is definetly a really good upgrade,life s to short for bad coffee,this wa a whole vibe dude your video are amazing keep up the great work,do u use the standard filter or other,imagine being that slow,the steam wand is not the original one i suspect where did you get this upgraded one,hey there what song is this,un video molto rilassante sento il profumo di caff,oh mate speed up life is too short,nice video 18g coffee in one shot usually in youtube coffee master take 14g per double shot what filter basket do you use i can not see it in equipment list,nico hey i also have a dedica and i am not able to fill it with nearly 16g of fine grain or the liquid just doe not pass through what is your way of doing it in consequence,nico fair i have a magica with 58mm portafilter thus i go with 18g but i would rather lower the dose and keep the ratio than change the ratio unless you prefer a different ratio then go for it,patbm2811 not for a 52 mm basket if i grind for a ratio around 2 1 and put 18 gramm in my dedica usually suffocates,18g for a double shot is actually pretty standard most will range between 17 20g 14g is a rather small double shot especially if you consider the normal 2 1 ratio he ha a quite short ratio with 18g in and 28g out making it a mix between espresso and ristretto go for a 18g in 36 40g out for your double shot if you want to be somewhat safe or even better experiment a long a you got exactly what you like best but always enjoy,cool but why do you need the scale after putting the coffee in the espresso machine i understand that you need to measure how much you put in the machine but after that i do not get it is use,he wanted to measure the amount of brewed coffee usually ppl is looking for 1 2 ratio so 18g ground coffee and try to get 36g of brewed coffee in this case he got about 30g so about 1 1 7 ratio,i looooove the little scale what s the brand it doesnt look like classic kitchen scale,you have a good set up however what you did is a ristretto am i right 18 2g of grind to 30 1g of liquid resulting to a 1 1 6 ratio thank you,pretty much thought the same thing,did you change the nozzle of milk frother,yes he did,i love the classic brazilian music perfect with coffee,great video just out of curiosity why do you still have a dedica when you also have a la marzocco a linea mini from the look of it any reason for keeping both,igor versiani i use linea for small pitcher a well and i get perfect result,my guess dedica warms up much quicker and linea mini is steam pressure is too much for such a small pitcher,hi how do i change the wand to a more progressional one without the bulky tip,you can get a rancilio silva steaming wand which you can put into this machine it is a bit of a pain though,i m interested too,link to get your steamer wand please hate cleaning the stock wand,i think it is the rancillio after market but a link would be nice,hello i got a question do you turn the steamer to cappuccino or hot milk option for doing latte art i tried the way you did a couple of time but failed to do art on the surface of the espresso however i made a single espresso how many gram of milk do i need or how many second shall i steam the milk shall it be foamy or intense could you please help me,hey ive been having problem a well i would definitely use the hot milk option for latte art with the cappucino option your foam will get to stiff and dry in my experience,i believe he is replaced the stock steamer with the rancilio silvia steam wand,i do so,remove the cover from the wand just leave the black rubber part it should help with foaming,he ha a upgraded machine his steamer is not to compare with the one included to the machine the one wich is included there is not much of a difference between the two option but anyway try to angle the steamer and just let it dip into the milk not to deep try to create a little vortex without putting to much air into it silky and smooth it should be not foamy and stiff xd,which coffee bean do you use any recommendation for good coffee bean,for espresso it best to use coffee between 2 6 week after roasting,buy directly from the coffee roaster or a specialty cafe or from a online coffee store for an easier brew using espresso machine use medium dark to dark roasted coffee bean preferably a blend specifically made for espresso,gaya mutu keunggulan,hey arty i am using ec680 and my espresso always so watery what could be the problem,gavin chrisaputra late reply but the finer the grind the more pressure it need to get through the coffee thus having a longer extraction time try to shoot for 25 second on average with a ratio from 1 to 2 5 for espresso so 18g of grinded bean to 45g of espresso,seyed ahh okay thanks for the info bro,make sure that the bean are grinded right,how many ml of milk,arty home thanks a lot,160 ml,what is the song name,arty home thank you,song fascination f d marchetti album screen mood koga guitar romantic arr m saeki,hmm relaxing what is that basket you are usung mine is a lot smaller,04 20,18 2 g is to mach,i use a non pressurized portafilter with that you can get a perfect sharp and creamy espresso,instablaster,whats the title of the song bro,what is model of weighing scale,2021 ver i guess,timeore,what pitcher size are you using,how big is your portafilter,hey great video i got the same machine with the original frother my milk is sometimes too bubbly any tip,replace the steamer wand with a different one,do you time the extraction by yourself because the machine ha pre set extraction time in it,you can customize the extraction time but holding down either button for a long a you want,what temperature configuration do you use saludos de chile,i use middle,someone said time counter should be started at 1st drip however someone said time counter should be started when pressing the ec685 coffee button i would like to know which one is correct many thanks,just ha to be a reference,i think it work for both which method do you like use that method,hey i could need some advice i am using the delonghi with a bottomless portafilter but i always get espresso that taste a bit sour i only have a graef cm 702 grinder but at the finest setting even with really light tamp the machine can not press enough water through the coffee when adjusting the grind i got a seemingly perfect shot 17g in 25g out in 27 no channeling but i still have some sourness i used two different type of coffee so i do not think that the coffee is a problem also the two were quite dark roast do you have anny tipps advice i would highly appreciate it thanks,it can also be a temperature issue unless you have temperature control try to preheat the system a much a possible,you try to increase the amount of ground coffee more,great work your video are very relaxing could you write the soundtrack playlist in the description thanks,yes the soundtrack please,arty home yes can you please add the soundtrack music in the description a i can not find any so lovely to listen it while you make and drink your beautiful coffee xx,thank you,hi where i can buy the little metal cup where you put the grinded coffee and later put in the the filter,from ebay you search stainless steel 2oz cup,nice i see your ec685 have other cappuccinatore than my can you confirm thx,i have a problem with my delonghi in which the espresso doe not pour out beautifully but rather in drip doe anybody know how to fix,it flow slowly or quickly grind the coffee bean too finely or too rough,very very veryyyyy cool,great jobd man,i have the same machine it doe not make the foam properly i followed many tip and video but it never bring the foamy milk like the one you got i am not sure if you used the same foam you got fr the dedica,hi could you share your setup i use the same dedica with normal portafilter and 2 cup basket but no chance to put 18gramms of grind coffe into it and somehow single shot time is only 15 17 but somehow i get more than 70grams of extract so ratio is more than 4 i watched many video but could not figure out what is the problem any idea thx in advance and sorry know i am newbie,got a 51mm non pressurized filter basket on amazon took out the black plastic part it fit perfectly i can live with the screw third hole for better coffee good coffee bean fine grind size even distribution and tamp your espresso will be perfecto,i have had the same problem with you with the default portafilter coming with delonghi dedica coffee machine the maximum capacity this portafilter get is about 14gr of not so finely ground coffee in the 2 cup basket i have tried with finer grind and wa able to put in 18gr of coffee but the result wa not being able to extract proper espresso shot only after changing to non pressurized portafilter i have managed to extract proper espresso shot with really fine ground coffee here arty home ha modified the default portafilter to fit the non pressurised basket i believe a non pressurized basket the one with multiple instead of one whole in conjunction with finely ground coffee is your solution,i think a good grinder and fine grinding will help you,filip cicmansky thx what did you bought sell this and buy an other one still an option a i drink just espresso and cappuccino,most likely your grinder isnt fine enought i had the same problem u til i invested into proper espresso grinder around gbp200 i would auggest going to a coffee shop and asking them to grind you a dose and trying to extract it with your portafilter at home,loving your video and i appreciate your workflow mine for my dedica is similar but i do not have a nice of a grinder so i usually do the water spritz trick when i load my single dose into the hopper because i get slightly worse static you took the plastic insert out of your portafilter right how did you prevent the drip from the middle hole and still fit the basket in,i cut off the top of the plastic you can watch the video,u are using stock portafilter with a dfferent busket may u explain more on your setup thanks,i want you to watch video on my channel then you will understand more,why using dedica when you havd lamarzocco quicker warm up time,arty home,yes because it warm up faster,why you always drink cafe latte,arty home what about espresso,i like making latte art and drinking it,,arty home,2 cup 16 20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

remove any airgaps so that it a compact puck work a charm for me what i do is fill the basket with coffee till the brim more then 1 scoop of coffee the provided scoop give then i tamper it quite hard hope this help,v v not yet i think it is exactly the opposite the coffee is not grinded enough i will try other coffee,hey i too am facing the same problem have u found a solution,happy to see good coffee next time,,what kind of cofee wa that omg,you mean the coffee brand dallmayr classic,nice video and unboxing but you need to learn to properly make an expresso not adequate coffee with hole inside it is not the pressure you just have to pressure it evenly,thanks for the tip,not good,i must admit you really did not make this machine seem any good i have this machine and i am no barista but it actually is a good machine having said that when i first used it it did seem a bit crap now after learning it and some of it feature it make a great coffee i am quite lazy though and i use the ese pod save time and mess,banan muhammad you can take off the metal tube and just use the silicon one if you want to have complete control on how much steam you put in though you do need a little experience,banan muhammad i made 1 perfect steamed milk from this machine i started with push down the tube to cappuccino first for fist 5 sec of steaming process then push up to hot milk mode for the rest until you get temp that you want during the process of steaming have to tilt a jug a bit and let is the milk moving in circle you gon na get perfect milk for latte art,my steam tube is not working so well sometimes it is stopping just even 5 sec anyone have problem with it,can you have control of how to texturize the milk like not making it too foamy to have latte texture not cappuccino,how many mililiters should i get for 1 cup,steam cappuccino mode it work for like 4 5 second then it go off and then the single and the double coffee button blink on the machine it is a new machine what am i doing wrong here,dinesh nadar i have problem with steam mode too can you tell me how to solve it,surprise unboxing club ok so i wa not pushing the steam switch properly to the extreme right the reason it get stopped now sorted thank you for your reply,hi when the steam cappuccino mode is lightened press it then you can use the steam switch on the right side of the machine to get hot milk or foam when you release the switch all 3 button are lighting up again then you have to press the stram cappuccino mode again if you want to use it again but there is no time limit to use the steam cappuccino mode 4 5 second is definitely too le then i guess there is something wrong with it,1percent coffee 99percent milk,hehe exactly a lady coffee,solo le per la grandezza delle bolle che hai nella crema di latte dovresti vergognarti d,what is tamper diameter,51mm,,i made a creamy espresso using delonghi dedica with a non pressurized portafilter,artem yavorskyi eureka mignon is the grinder which i use it is good and compatible with many type of coffee machine,coffee nomad what grinder do you use,daniel 12345 i think i shall try it,i also use the dedica non pressurised with the sage dose control pro grinder the coffee is incredible,all what we need is a grinder and the perfect coffee bean,estas chavo,which is better this one or the ecp 35 31,very very light coffee did u drink that,hi it wa the first one i ever made i am still using this coffee machine daily but now i got some more experience with the right coffee bean it really taste not bad,my machine is having a problem making foam,i am having the same problem sometimes try to clean the milk frother this help me,with this piece of junk,thx for this video i needed,thank you luis happy to hear that,is this full stainless steel cause on other color like red or black seems plastic,lena t i got the stainless steel one it is all metal very high quality exceeded my expectation good machine but the milk frothing is a joke,it is partly plastic i think,also consider the new german wmf espresso lumero model also in even better quality own brand stainless steel it look very similar but more square in design anyone know if dl ha licenced it production to wmf a specification i think are exactly the same,that is not a good cup of coffee,gordan babi and it pressurised i non pressurised mine because the coffee tasted artificial with the stock pressurised basket,the goat pear it is underextracted 16 second it should be around 25 watery and no crema you can make way better cup of coffee with this machine but it required knowledge,why,like a barista mi cojones jajajajajajajajs,the coffee is not espresso soft grind it likely for brewed coffee thats why the extraction is not well enough nice unboxing vid and machine,thanks mohammed for the info that wa my first ever made coffee and with this machine i did not know when i unboxed it now i know,good machine bad barista,the shot is terrible ill probably look for another brand,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,my office have this one thats why i need to learn how to make it,good to hear hope this video help a bit with it,i have demo a video on how to make latte art,thanks,you are welcome glad to hear,crap demo,barista lol your coffee is watery tamping is bad and the overall finished drink look quite poor,v b forgetting a single letter ha nothing to do with spelling the title is misleading and the tutorial suck judging by the like dislike i am not the only one sorry for triggering you lol,first of all learn to spell and second of all stop hating people on the internet just because they are trying to help others out do not get me wrong i am very sorry that an internet tutorial channel did not meet your high standard,thats bad barista very light coffee,that tamping wa not great you could see the hole in the top of the puck the water would have channelled through this is why the shot wa so light in colour nice video though,pressurized basket do not need 30lb tamping like nonpressurized so i think the problem wa what the other viewer mentioned,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,pourquoi le connoisseur du caf ont parfois de cheveux argent s,everything i hoped it would be i love the simplicity of this keurig mybest kitchen i have had the old school original keurig for forever i decided to upgrade to button lol same great quality without having to measure your water this keurig doe all the thinking for you i also love not having to put water into the machine every time i want to use it simple and perfect,thx for your video i have a jura impressa s90 and want to change to a barista machine the problem you mentioned switching between coffee and steam you have with the most automatic coffee machine because the most of this machine have only one boiler too so this is not a real problem for someone who want to change to a barista system what i think about the dedica it not the best on the market but okay for those who start his barista experience and absolutely okay what you get for the price you can change to an expensive one later if you unsatisfied with your coffee machine,just a little point i can hear the british english you got taught popping through on certain word or is it australian,nice english congratz,wtf is that man that s not a real coffe change the setting on it and make a real shot the best machine can be the worst if the user doesn t know how to use it proper,,which is better this one or breville bambino,good point but you can purchase a bottomless portafilter non pressurized and choose the manual setting to time the shot you want from the delonghi,any recommendation please,andy love photography you long press on the shot button for how many second you want to pour best is between 25 30 second for a single shot but keep in mind that the machine doe a 1 2 second preinfuse,andy love photography i am trying to find info on that too,how would one do the manual setting i can not figure mine out,if you are going to review a product i guess at the very least you should have used it recently or remember clearly all feature the dedica while being a toy for any person who is serious about coffee with a couple of fairly simple modification can deliver great result with both coffee and milk thanks,stop fussing he did an excellent video,yeah i stopped watching he moment they said they have not used it in 6 month,spot on watching this after my first use if this machine ok third by the time i figured it out i think you nailed all the major hiccup need a separate grinder tough for making multiple cappuccino in a row and limited flexibility however for home use 1 or 2 drink at a time in conjunction with a grinder great machine for the price i like my american drip coffee and now i can crank out a great cappuccino for the lady with ease nice and small and fit great in my small kitchen would highly recommend for those with limited space fund and need,this dedica 785,is this better or smeg espresso,what is the other machine you have,merci pour le vid o je voulais savoir si je peux utiliser sans probl me un filtre classique non pressuris avec la delonghi dedica en adaptant le porte filtre videmment mais surtout est ce que la machine me permet de le faire correctement au niveau pression etc merci de me renseigner,the french review merci pour ta r ponse comme moulin j ai simplement un graef cm90,don karbone oui sans probleme tu peux acheter un non pressurise filtre sur amazon pour gbp10 et ca fonctionnera parfaitement oui cette machine peut delivrer jusqu a 15 bar de pressure et 9 suffira parfaitement je peux t envoyai un lien pour le basket si tu n est pa sur j envisage de refaire quelque video aussi sur cet machine tu pourras y jeter un oeil tu a quoi comme moulin,thank you so much for the review it gave me an overview,the french review i am about to it is currently out of stock here in the philippine i like the metal though,what did you end up doing did you buy it,uhhh plastic in the portafilter and the steam wand can be very bad for your health never drink hot liquid that passed through hot plastic,absolutely agree but the inner tubing are also plastic at this price point there is no choice at all you need to move to rancillo silva range to get copper tubing internal and full commercial portafilter the reason an old timer like rancillo is still in the market,a answer there is a plastic insert in the portafilter and it can be removed there are several

3,doe anyone here have any knowledge on the delonghi ec785,it is good i like it,i have this model for it size it pack a punch pull great coffee even though the basket is pressurized,pretty good machine but my wife struggled with it definitely a learning curve for people who do not really have that passion for coffee,a great review i have enjoyed my delonghi i like it compact size it delivers good constant quality result,hello hope you can help me or someone can help me we are a home of 3 people that enjoy coffe some espresso some capuchino and some latte we are confused with what machine should we buy our option are this one the ec860 and de delonghi ec685m deluxe all your help will be appreiate it,shame about the steam wand people change for the recilio,i get far better result than that with the 40 pc robusta bean i have i get 2 third crema and a dark brown and red crema with most other bean i can not i have replaced the sieve with a normal one have used it for 3 year 3 time a day i grind my own coffee but it can also be used with senso or ese pad forgot to say ready in just a few minute not 20 like the stupidly expensive machine of my friend that get rubbish result,expected to see how the machine work got exactly that and a good laugh great job,why is it so difficult to move the filter holder from insert to close on the delonghi dedica,really like your way of presentation,what is it any diffirrent with ec785 gy recommand me pls for ec785 gy review video thanks,thanks for this review honestly the best video i watched smooth and clear explanation you go direct to the point,i wa curious if it is possible that james dedica wa set to a lower temperature setting since when i got myself a dedica it seems to be running really hot to the point where i ended up lowering the temperature setting it come with out of the box or perhaps it could be an issue with either the machine i got or the one he had,that woman is hilarious and amazing at the same time,good presentation but it is the worst espresso machine i have ever owned a machine i would owned fro 24 year finally gave up the ghost and at my age there is no point buying something expensive that will outlive me the dedica came highly recommended so much for that sorry it is a bad coffee maker if you are drawing 8 10 cappuccino a day,i find that the pump on this machine is very weak,hi i hv just decided to buy this machine because of your very nice review gail tks for sharing,thanks for the video very instructive,thanks for the demo got this machine it will be perfect for the apartment,coffee should not get in contact with aluminium and hot should not get in contact with plastic all this is ruining your health and influence immensely the taste of the coffee better to choose something more expensive with stainless steel upgrade top class professional gear doe not utilise aluminium nor plastic that may come in touch with coffee so let choose semiprofessional home appliences that take that philisophy after the best,sold,uhhh plastic in the portafilter and the steam wand can be very bad for your health never drink hot liquid that passed through hot liquid,miss you seriously made me laugh hahahhaha amazing video thanks a lot,hello thanks for video sorry l can not make first milk after that make coffee l do not know why l have to first make coffee my coffee machine same like that,i hope this thing is light year better than the delonghi stilosa which is a dumpster fire piece of crap a decent shot ai not happening i bought one and gave it a week before returning it,i too enjoyed the video perhaps you could also include how well the machine brew the espresso before adding the milk how wa the crema wa it a smooth shot wa it gritty otherwise thanks for helping buyer make better informed purchasing decision thanks,hi is this machine good for commercial use for start up small coffee shop,i have been having difficulty finding a good espresso coffee

western europe,i wish she wa my mom,i subscribed just because how cool she is haha i love the vibe she is giving,hahahah funny way of starting,hello i am totally new in the espresso making and i have a very limited budget i wa thinking on buying an used machine of this model but i have an essential question maybe someone can help me which is the most suitable and affordable grinder for this machine d,love how she presented it,witch grind to you use,i have this coffee machine it really for newbie who want to have imitation of decent espresso or latte cappuccino you gon na ask why so portafilter with this little hole in it it not producing crema a it should be it just a trick crema disappears quickly a it not created by water steam pressure going through coffee but through this tiny hole in portafilter the steam wand doe not allow to produce decent steamed milk with correct texture it also created for people who do not have experience technique to foam milk so it extremely hard to do any latte art tamper also ha to be replaced summarizing if you want this machine because of the design it really nice though to make your espresso better you have to buy naked portafilter it not so pricy on aliexpress good grinder that allows to grind finer than those market grinder for 40dollar or you can disassemble it change grinding to finder and usable again it not perfect solution a those grinder produce a lot of coffee dust which make coffee more sour there is not much you can do about the steam wand if you do not want to loose warranty i would recommend to replace it with classic one in general if you want just design and so called espresso it ok,airplane you so crazy,that first line got me a,this lady is so great,i sick look at her better sleep at home,this woman is the best,are you going to do a review on the de longhi distinta coffee machine i quite fancy the dedica deluxe at this stage,lady is great funny and nice presentation,i removed the plastic and sawed off the bottom to make a bottomless portafilter trust me the espresso get between the plastic and the metal and when you unscrew that is portion to remove the plastic you will be very glad that you removed the plastic,can you make an americano using this machine,is the plastic inside the basket safe for long term use i believe the plastic metls over a period and cause all kind of health issue including cancer an deformity is it removable,can someone help me is it worth the money is their a better machine in the same price range do you recomend buying it,delonghi make nice tamper for this at least it is sold in europe,just discovered this channel this lady is amazing your character expertise and clarity are refreshingly rare never stop,same here,great review from a tell it like it is likeable believable person thanks want to comment that i just bought the dedica ec680 which is compared with this newer ec685 it is indicated that there are two major difference but i have only found one major one and one minor one yes the steam nozzle on the newer one ha two setting which is the major change but the drip tray on both model actually come apart not just the ec685 so you can use taller glass in both i call it a minor change however because there is no metallic removable secondary drip tray in the ec680 when you take the drip tray unit apart but if you do not want need flat hot milk then buying the ec680 is a much better deal a the unit are otherwise indistinguishable in how they function and a deal breaker for some inability to use a taller glass is actually possible in the older machine,gale you are amazing thank you dear for this great presentation,best ever video,great job could listen all day thanks,hello i still have the pressurized basket and i use the graef grinder do you have any idea why i get bitter and burnt coffee,could be your grinder i have seen other folk complain about this when you are grinder is burr get too hot then it mess up the bean it give them a sour burnt taste,is this the ec685 w thank you dedica,good job,plastic on the hottest spot not ideal,just for fun you know,love the way you talk greeting from egypt,you did not froth the milk properly you did not taste the espresso shot to see if they are extracted properly and you do not know how to pour milk all your video are like that i like to see review from true barista is,i bought it and have no regret i am saving more money here in the long run than buying coffee in cafe since it is lockdown i have great craving for coffee that this machine have met,zanke tanti,i do not even need to buy an espresso machine i am watching this video for gail,although it make nice coffee and milk it ha few problem if you have to make 2 capputsino then you have to make the first one then turn the machine off and then turn it on and make the 2nd one mine broke down within a year delonghi took it back and repaired it they didnt replace it with new yesterday it broke down again i am very happy about the quality of coffee it make especially if you know how to use it but very unhappy it broke twice,hello just bought my coffee machine coffee grinder and now i have to both set the coffee grinder and the espresso shot i have been reviewing your and some other video in regard to this topic separately but never at the same time a both set ups are interconnected how should i proceed if i set the coffee machine without coffee in it to a specific amount of espresso shot when i add my bean it might be le due to water absorbance then for setting up my grinding i need to control the flow for x milliliter of final coffee in the cup so how would you recommend me to set everything up thank you,that airplane part wa beautifully random lol,ok it look like she is too kind to tell that this machine is rubbish,a lovely video thanks i got given one of these new i find the coffee it doe is insipid,is the grinder included with the coffee machine thanx,no you have to purchase one and my advice for grinder you have to get a better one it is really effect the taste of espresso shot,why it produce so poor crema,maybe it is not a fresh bean and she use a pressurized basket i am using this machine with naked portafilter and non pressurized basket it is give me a good result,in the video the machine sounded very quiet is that how you would describe it thanks for any information,hmmm i ordered one of amazon uk and it arrived today and the milk thingy doe not work looking at it the pump doe not run when i turn the steam thingy question the long rubber bit under the metal that you removed is that required for it to work it would appear it is missing on mine so i wa going to contact amazon or whoever about that,little bit of somethin something nothing lol,great machine bought on the basis of this vid,did not know mine wa the deluxe version lol,just like my smeg one look the same,you are right my daughter ha the smeg and it look almost the same with

is very upset,4 21 plenty of dirt cheap tamper available in 51mm both on ebay and amazon now,mixalis nikolaou yep also i recommend buying a non pressurised portafilter i bought one and it made a huge

hahaha i always like your video,xd,i want to open up very little coffee shop in my little town and i do not have a money for fancy big batista machine in the beginning i wonder if i can start my work with this machine use it for a while and then get a better one,is the porta aluminum metal safe for food purpose because sometimes people tend to remove the plastic part and using non pressurize basket so the coffee get direct contact with the metal,if someone ha knowledge about this please share with u,i do not drink coffee my family doe so i can make it for the however the main reason i am looking at this machine is that when i used to make coffee for a living i also used to make really awesome hot chocolate with the frothy steamed milk and this machine is nice and thin which is great in my limited space it more importantly look to make great frothy milk and only heat required amount of water needed for single use at a time i could also make a cuppa tea with it which is awesome given it is my main drink,instant thumb up for this lady plane humour,coffee is acidic that is why it is not a good idea to have hot coffee pouring into plastic and then into your stomach,gail is review change how i think about thing,what is the size of the filter holder,the airplane bit is so goofy love it,i wan na be her friend,coffee newbe here doe making coffee out of these taste good like a starbucks latte,with a decent grinder and good bean it will taste way better than anything you can get at starbucks,is this product also called dedica style ec685 w,just bought the machine the frothing is a bit disappointimg but maybe i am not doing it right,w is a white wersion of the same coffee maker,love you gail,i just ordered mine i am so excited i can not contain myself,stealtho peep who care that you do not care,bruh who care,napz999 i have had mine for a year and it is still going i like it,it ha been 6 month since u ordered how is it are you still happy that you ordered or it wa le than what you expected im about to get one tomorrow i hope you will respond soon or any one else who had this machine thank you,how do you like it,we call that suicide of cappucino,a little bit of something something nothing i died lol,hey gail love your review how about do a few combination coffee espresso machine review,dang she is expert,you are a cool person,i bought a new ec685 in january 2019 i had one older that i bought 3 year ago but the pump gave up 3 year wa ok a i usually make 7 double shot a day i think the best advantage with my new one not shown in this video are the coffee filter now made up of 2 part the perforated filter that can be removed from the part with the one small hole for pressurizing this make it easier to check clogging in the perforated filter and the other part just hold up the part to a light window and you will observe any clogging use a needle a described in the manual to avoid clogging i also place a small round piece of filter paper that i cut out from normal melitta filter to perfectly fit the bottom of the perforated part one melitta filter give me 14 small piece and i cut 4 filter at the same time which is pretty fast and i now have 56 piece to further avoid clogging i weekly clean the filter by putting a 1 3 tsp of baking soda in the filter basket and run 2 3 water shot and then rinse the part a mentioned this is pressurized system but it would be very easy to make it a non pressurized system just drilling the one small hole to open it further i will try on the 1 shot filter to see how it work,so did you try to depressurize it,why do you make coffee the wrong way round is it an american thing,jacques du plessis i think it mix better this way also,hi what microphone set up do you use for your camera please,i wa buy this little machine super i recommend,i not disaster,why do not you make review about delonnghi 3351,thanks for posting it great video i am setting up a bike caffe a small business where i will serve espresso on wheel do you think i could use that gear dedica in that business thanks,for what a stranger on the internet opinion worth you would struggle to pull it off due to the temperature fluctuation between steam wand and espresso with this machine due it single boiler you will have inconsistent shot if selling latte and cappuccino and if you plan on making any quantity of espresso the water will be quick to overheat and it wont be so great the pressurised portafilter while convenient will not give you the kind of shot that a dedicated grinder fresh bean and correct grind size and extraction will you will be far more suited to aim for something in the prosumer market instead with a dual boiler coupled with a good quality grinder use the rancillio rocky a a point of reference if you any question i am happy to help just pop me an email at elevatecoffeetraining gmail com the world always need more coffee cheer,not bad but it cold hahahaha i do not like to drink cold coffee at all and i have tried delonghi machine it not giving hot coffee,scg ha such helpful video and always spot on i would like to know how many ounce of milk they pour and more milk foam froth detail maybe there is a video on that,love this channel i got a used ec155 about 6 month ago after discovering this channel have not used the deluxe but i would be willing to say that this machine is not worth the price difference of a 155 if you are just getting into espresso and wan na try out a cheap machine you can easily find a used ec155 for about dollar40 on ebay and clean mod it just a bit for about the same quality of drink at dollar350 i would probably save up a bit more for a breville just seems a bit more cost efficient,plastic in critical part shame i do not mind plastic body but plastic in steam line is bad,just bought this for dollar220 and it came with a free grinder best purchase ever,not sure about the machine but i love the presenter,thankyou so much for this review i will run to the nearest store to get this delongi coffee machine,or maybe you can buy it from the company that just spent time and money on a sale pitch,great vid cheer,helpful thx,nice reviewer sold,i regret why i bought nespresso citiz and saw this video,i blew mine up trying to get too much flavour out of each coffee packed the basket too tight machine deceased your relationship with the milk wand is more amicable than mine wa you present very well maybe a career in this field,i already have the dedica 680 amp love it i do not see anything that would cause me to covet the deluxe,i have the same one and i had try many different coffee and i can not get the coffee to make foam,i have just purchased delonghi ec 685 and right start from the first use it is not delivering hot water or steam i do not know what o have to do with brand new dedica,gale you are amazing never seen this channel and i do not even drink coffee but i subbed p,so i bought the ec680 2 month ago i took off the pressurized basket and bought a non pressurized one all i had to do wa remove the plastic piece inside the portafilter trim it down a bit put it back in place and inserted the non pressurized basket it work like a charm with that i bought a capresso grinder which manages to just about doe good grind for an espresso shot i put in 17g dose in the basket take about 25sec for about 34g yield espresso this is the biggest upgrade you do not need to change this machine if you do this upgrade a i get amazing shot there is such a massive difference in taste a well a the experience,harin dharmanandan what ground coffee do u use,what setting do you use on the capresso,hi guy fun review loved it i went and bought the dedica after seeing the review i like it so far but the amount of coffee it give is tiny i know it is espresso but come on you say in the video that the button are programmable but i think it is only for temperature and water hardness can the amount of coffee be programmed i have to press twice on the middle button to fill my cup thank you great channel,if you hold the button either one or two cup the coffee wil flow until you release it this volume will be saved by the machine and all your following shot will be the same volume,great review thank you,i like your energy very informative vid thanks,is it just me because i bought a machine on the european market or is delonghi a little off the standard the single cup button give me 50ml 1 7 oz and the double cup button give me 100ml 3 4 oz should not it be 30ml and 60ml 1 and 2 oz i know i can reprogram the button but how it is done seems pretty inaccurate to me,i found the same thing though it doe depend on coffee grind size and like others i find grinding for this machine deeply frustrating you can of course change the volume delivered by pressing and holding the 1 or 2 cup button until you get the desired amount then releasing the button to program it,i had one of these machine from about 14 month ago that had all these feature the boiler split and delonghi replaced it instead of repairing the new one i got is garbage the old one while loud made great shot with perfect crema i am a car guy not coffee but now it pours bugger all crema and leaf two gaping big black spot in the middle of the cup the basket come with a removable bottom now,,you are a delight a a reviewer lot of info and good showing continued success gail,0 50,honestly i just love gail haha she make me crack up and i watch video after video because she is just so great on camera keep it up,i have one it is great for home thanks for the review,mohammed al shuaili how is it holding up,this wa a treat to watch even though i am a 19 year old male i can not put my finger on it,is there any kind of water filter softener to place in the water tank for this machine,the manual read that there is one you can buy from delonghi there is a spot for it in the tank,do not think so i just use mineral water a i live in an area with very hard water the descaling alarm is basically just a counter that trigger after a certain number of us i think i pretty much ignore it now,can this machine make thicker coffee than this how do the barista in the cafe get the really thick coffee,fantastic thanks for the review,wa gon na ask wtf happened to your eye,i mean 5 17,5 23 that is what she said,i suspect the deluxe branding is just the term for the ec685 whereas the previous model wa the ec680 happy to stand corrected but i can not see any use of wouldeluxe in online store here in europe just ec685 with a suffix depending on colour m for metal bk for black r for red there is also a white version a demonstrated here but is often sold at a premium,this is true i just ordered the ec685 m and it ha all the new feature this wouldeluxe ha,i have the regulat dedica machine i do descaling on it twice a year changed the portafilter every year because it clog and it doe not matter whar type of coffee i use it will not have much brown froth foam do not matter if i tamp it little or too much sometimes the coffee drip instead of flow also feel like the machine is really trying a double shot barely count a a single show in volume i do not really like this machine bought a breville machine for my mom that cost twice a much sooo much better,what step on a rocky grinder would you suggest for it to come out smooth and not bitter,i have the standard machine and honestly there is very little difference having lived with one for a couple of year are there any downside the basket are impossible to clean and if they get clagged up totally knackered you can however get replacement basket on amazon with the bottom tray removable so you can clean them otherwise it is a pretty decent machine,hi gail i just bought my delonghi deluxe and rocky grinder but i still can not find the siting to make a good espresso do you have any recommendation,jen neuman yes do not grind very fine when using a pressurised basket use slightly coarser ground and you will get nicer espresso,i am using it in my coffee shop and it is amazing small and easy to use good choice for newbie,how is it doing now did you ever get a chance to have multiple customer waiting in line how long do you have to wait per shot,purchased the dedica a week ago and smashed through coffee that weekend love the machine great size which fit well on my kitchen work surface really easy to use and the espresso produced is fantastic make quick frothy milk ideal for flat white art bought my machine for gbp140 00 i have replaced the plastic tamper though useable is not ideal,where did you find it at that price,hi my sunbeam em5600 is getting a bit old and looking for a replacement how would you compare the dedica to the breville bes840,how much doe it cost in dollar,3,wow what a cool woman you are,5 19 that is what she said,hi dear i really like all your video including your fantastic humor thanks a lot,that lady is a great presenter,2 year later still such an awesome presenter,love gail,agree,death metal nah make her even cooler tbh,can i keep it switched on because of it automatic sleep mode because the power switch doe not seem to be the best at all love that machine good coffee for low price,still can not figure out where is the air intake of the panarello steam wand wish they upgrade the wand to those standard frothing wand instead of that standard panarello wand,i got a new delonghi machine ecp 35 31 it us the same filter basket of dedica but every time i brew an espresso i end up with a dirty brew head is that normal,hi gail do you know any good espresso machine that ha no plastic in the portafilter,for the hot milk mode doe it act like a traditional wand can i create decent microfoam with the hot milk mode on the steam wand,tina misu wang yes you can,tina misu wang no it just heat the milk with no foam,we have such machine at work and ok it is ok but when i have enough money to spare i am going for pided silvia and some grinder bottomless portafilter etc,i have old dedica and i would change it only for the colour i just love the look of white version mine is black and that is all i can not see any reason to buy it other than that so if you are person that do not have it yet just buy standard non deluxe version it is cheaper and i think that they already have even white color black metal red and white right now and i had to choose between black and metal when i wa buying it about machine itself it is really great of course it will not make perfectly foamed milk but still make decent one and i am sure it can do better with steam wand modification,i just got my standard one in black but am considering spray painting it the only downside is that i will void my warranty,huh 51mm tamper are quite common i picked up one on amazon for gbp10 the same price i paid for my delonghi bco410 on ebay,joe o sullivan aliexpress also ha 51mm tamper for anyone interested,gayle i love listening to you speak very american and funny,what is the most appropriate standard grinding coffee for this machine,fine grind,oh gail ha ha ha,can this be used for business or just for home,strictly for home use for business use you will need a high end espresso machine which usually cost a few thousand,thanks for the great video review gail almost returned this unit until i saw your video and learned what i wa doing that wa wrong,how many mm is the tamper for the dedica,51 mm,absolutely love the styling of this machine just wish they had an option that looked the same but offered higher end feature such a 58mm porta filter and steam wand rather than panarella add in some programability and you would have a winner,she is such a sweet heart,you mean he hehe,i got the exact same machine but it can not seem to extract fine grind grinder is the breville smart grinder pro i barely apply any pressure to even out the ground when temping it only drip with barely any coffee coming out in 10 second espresso taste sour help,go coarser with your grind the breville say a certain range is espresso but that is just a guideline also with the pressurized basket be very careful with fine grind there is only one hole on the bottom of many style of pressurized basket and it can be easily clogged with fine coffee grind soak your basket overnight in very hot water with cafiza powder dissolved and try brewing with the grind set to a notch or two coarser than you are using now,cornyroll i had te same problem i could not make double espresso i took it to service but delonghi said i put too much coffee two of their cup is too much for double basket idiot after that i complained to shop where i bought it and they managed with importer to give me new one this one work ok if i put much coffee and tamp hard it will choke but the old one choked with le coffee and no tamping so my conclusion is take it back where you bought it it is broken,i changed the wand on mind the standard one are terrible,do not take the plastic out of the portafilter you will have a great big screw holding the bottom,4 25,nice,gail is the best,do not forget to check her highly acclaimed video on latte design,i have had the dedica standard version for over a year now just some pointer 1 the plastic part in the portafilter doe not come out a far a im aware 2 the cup warmer ontop of the machine is non exsistent the temperature is hardly any different to the cold temperature of the bench it sits on 3 the milk steamer need to be cleaned after every use a the milk get stuck inbetween all those part the rubber and metal etc you can not just blow it out with hot steam 4 it look like they have improved the milk steamer with more frothy milk which is good 5 overall it a good little machine and im very happy with it and thouroughly recommend it to anyone it is the best in it price range when i bought it over a year ago,allison pell so do i,there is a screw on the portafilter by the nozzle that allows you to take the plastic part out agree on it being a great little machine i would not live without mine now,dedica come with pre brew or you can program it thanks,look like that frother would fit the older model a well wonder if they sell it separately,i would not rush out and buy the upgraded machine i have the original and it is not drastically different tamper you can get one amazon for around five pound 51mm otherwise it pretty much do is what it say and it make a pretty decent cup of coffee for the money only thing i would add is you a cup or something for when you put the steamer on a you get a squirt of water before it start to steam,bought my son the dedica for christmas we really enjoy the taste speed and simplicity of this unit always a pleasure to watch your entertaining review thank you,look identical to smeg is machine maybe even the exact same machine that is just branded differently are smeg and delonghi somehow related,smeg wa second delonghi made it first so smeg ripped off design it is 100percent the same machine with just changed outside design,i have the smeg seems to be the same internals with a different coat best machine i have had,i want the gaggia classic i did not realize your a store,hi gail great review i have this machine but my coffee come out tasting very watery what am i doing wrong could it be something with the water teperature keep up the good work cheer from sweden,final bos have you tried a finer grind setting with your grinder i have a different machine but i have to dial in the right fineness with my grinder for each different type of bean i use the store grinder absolutely doe not work with my machine,hi there did you manage to make better coffee cause i have just bought this machine with the delonghi kg521 grinder a few day ago and to be honest i am not really that satisfied with the shot i pull they do not really have a body i know it is a pressurized basket so i am ordering another basket and maybe a second portafilter a well to make bottomless to do a non pressurized basket mod maybe that will make thing better compared to my capsule machine before krups dolce gusto it is not that better anyway if you by any chance got some tip that helped you grind size tamping whatever i would like to hear them,i got this machine and wa really disappointed in it espresso wa not hot enough flavor wa just ok i switched to breville infuser and love it so hot amazing crema and flavor,can anyone recommend a nice grinder that is dollar100,badnercalabrese the gvx212 it is only dollar46 in the u any opinion on the gvx1 it is about dollar10 more these are burr machine right,how much,what you get is a lot of plastic for your money with a pressurized portafilter you do not make espresso just coffee,what aeroplane have you been on,what is the difference between the dedica style and the deluxe,i just do not understand why delonghi doe not use standard 58mm porta filter 51mm is really odd can not get any accessory with this size,well i am using a la pavoni and we are also using 51 49mm portafilters 58mm are usually for higher end commercial machine,surprised i do not have trouble finding accessory but you are right why do not they all stick to 58mm and provide a portafilter to hold a standard volume of ground,but have they cured the leaking problem i had to return 3 unit straight away because of massive leak from underneath we changed to a different model which is fine we are not alone,the manual mention that an excess of water under the tank would be normal and should be dried up when needed,my standard version dedica literally arrived within hour of this video can not wait to test it btw thanks gail another great video,luciano mieldazis did you test what about espresso in this machine,best budget grinder for dedica pressurized basket,the gvx212 is dollar46 u any idea if the gvx1 14 is any better or the difference,50 60euros,domo delonghi krups severin sencor russel hobbs have same internals difference is in the motor chasis and price i wa looking at capresso infinity called in my country nivona cafegrando cost about 80 90euros but mby there is something better then that,thats 300euros for grinder and ec685m cost me 180euros im looking for something cheaper about 1 2 price of machine friend owns graef cm 800 and it grind too fine for pressurized portafilter and cost around 150euros,how about feima 600n or 610n it is taiwanese but not bad for it price,i first watched the video on my phone and i wa shocked i wa like what is wrong with your eye gail now that i am on my laptop i can see you have the basket on whew thanks for explaining the difference between pressurized and unpressurized basket i hope you and the crew had a great holiday break happy new year,1 thing that seems to hard to pinpoint is the grind size the pressurized filter doe not allow espresso sized grind you need to go a little bigger that is why dedica grinder is a must buy,badnercalabrese that is my exact setup it work well enough for what i need,i set my grind size about half way between fine and medium any smaller it clog up any coarser and it is weak if i buy ready ground coffee from the supermarket i run it through the burr grinder to take it down a big finer and you get a much better coffee,i heard de longhi say extraction time for these machine is 18 21 second so i assume just adjust your grind setting to get that extraction time,i have a delonghi with that type of portafilter when i go to tap out the ground the little filter always come out any idea why i end up having to poke the ground out with a spoon in order to not fish the filter out of the trash,haha i got ta tip do not knock it out on the sink snap your wrist in the air above the bin without knocking it on anything it will come right out,wow so i am not crazy at least not about this i do let it cool sometimes i accidentally leave the ground in there until i make another cup,cool down the basket for a while 30 or le and u will be fine,activediabetic because these type of machine doe not have three way selonid valve after brewing a coffee there is no sucking the wetness out of the puck that is why is doe not work by knocking out the puck,dollar100 more expensive than previous version not much upgrade to justify that better to go for breville duo temp pro instead of this or capresso ec pro,same in sweden just bought the 685 for 150 euro my old 680 wa 200 euro 3 or 4 year ago the pump stopped working on the old one but i still decided to by the 685 a i wa very satisfied with the coffee it made,in my country it cost the same if not even cheaper than 680,just bought the ec685 for 144 euro that is dollar166 can not really complain about the price even filter coffee machine like moccamaster cost more,i got a 51mm calibrated tamper on amazon for 21 buck so far it is my favorite thing from amazon,score,jason whitton tamper in china can be bought for dollar5 or le,the dedica is a fantastic machine so simple yet so capable and a packed with so many feature for the price the first thing i did wa remove the panarello frothing nozel and just used the rubber nozel underneath with a bit of technique and a small milk pitcher you can create surprisingly good milk to make latte art some may even call it microfoam also if you remove the plastic bit in the porter filter you can actually fit a 51mm non pressurised basket found one on amazon called magideal coffee 2 cup 51mm only 4 quid and work a treat,tina misu wang if i understood well the rubber part the nozzle for froth if this is it then the problem is simple you must wash off the nozzle disconnecting it from the metal outer part if there is a i do not know this maschine in particular once milk get hard there it block the way for new milk the pressure push the rubbef down,hey scott i just got this machine and i am wondering what is the best grind setting on my delonghi burr grinder all the way to fine,utsav soni if i got you right you mean two different coffee brand if so it is normal the need to adjust the dose and grind to achieve comparable yield you can try and revert with the result and yes if there is no output from the espresso machine you can melt the pump i would stop once there ha been 10 15 sec with no output,hello scott is it possible to change the steam wand tip to change it for a 2 hole 4 hole tip thanks for the insight,scarface4u2 hey so i bought the machine and it working really well i have a question to run by you i used two coffee with the same espresso grind and using the same pressure to pack it then why doe one pour a good 60 ml shot and the other one hardly 10 ml i am not complaining about the taste but will the one taking longer time to extract damage the machine kindly enlighten me,hey guy big fan i wa wondering which one of the following would you believe make a better cup o coffee siphon chemex v60 aeropress french press,kalita wave or siphon if you want to spend the money,aeropress and french press are awesome,de gustibus non est disputandum in matter of taste there can be no dispute it is a matter of personal preference some like the way french press produce the body some like it better with siphon but to me i like how aeropress creates the body it feel bolder and with metal filter it taste richer than paper filter but when i want a thinner body or le stronger taste i felt pour over can delivers i think it come down on how the contraption work pour over have some what le contact with the grind a the water pass through and for the press well it press the grind and this extract the grind to some extent of course the bean quality the roasting grind size water quality temperature etc and many other thing that can change the end result to which eventually come down to de gustibus d,i have this machine and i have to correct you on one thing it actually allows me to make latte art i would recommend it to people who just got into coffee and brewing to learn more about it i will definitely upgrade to a better machine that allows non pressurised brewing but until then i will keep enjoying this machine,you can use non pressurised basket with this machine a well i agree with you about upgrading to a real espresso machine which is capable of producing good crema do not forget to buy a good grinder,u drawn a baby dinosaur,the original version look much better in my opinion i can only hope that the painted surface are metal and not plastic the original also ha a removable tray to fit tall cup though without the metal drip tray on the very bottom so the only worthwhile new feature is the dual mode panarello i have the original version work very well and make great coffee without taking up too much space on the counter,i just ordered the ec685 it come in different color i chose the metal design,i wa hoping to upgrade my old dedica for this machine expecting it would come with unpressurized basket and non penarello steam wand guess i will stick to my old one with self upgraded non pressurized basket and naked portafilter,you can order 51mm non pressurized basket from ebay cheap but they take a while,nice review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

voor lief en geniet van het proces,hi sir where did you purchase the special spout,thanks i bought it al ready via lazada cost 1150 peso,i bought it on ebay it is a rancilio silvia v1 v2 wand,lol this is ridiculous mobile espresso machine your grinder with multiple adjustment still grind either to fine or to coarse you use a weighing scale to make an espresso so much effort on the other hand a real man should have an original hobby what is this cult name btw,dutch home barista i had no doubt you enjoyed it best,hi jacek i still like it,hello i just bought this coffee delonghi 685 and it very hard to slot in the filter holder and throwing away the excess coffee doe anyone ha any tip,dev patel hi dev it can be more the one reason but most of the time it is becaus the grid is to caurse try

about my failure now,biba kroll you can try steaming with only the little black rubber wand try to put he pip of the little black wand on the surface in a way it inject a little air it also take some practice it took me month go get it,i must admit i am having difficulty with mine i bought it about three month ago mostly i am having issue with the steam wand i want hot milk but i invariably end up

machine enjoy,hi what is the brand of your coffee grinder,hi katrina it is a gefu lorenzo it is not the best ginder for espresso the grind step are a little to big,i am not sure what im doing wrong

you do but it it really feel a if the extract is not particularly strong,dutch home barista i will these might be the last day to fully enjoy it before world war explodes on u all,scottish traveller hi luke great to hear enjoy your coffee,dutch home barista i just ended up using the double portion for every coffe i make for myself and i extended the brewing time while using the medium temperature now i can finally enjoy a nicely brewed coffee,you can try to use finer coffee grind,i wonder how do you clean inside of the coffee machine please,i use a dedicated liquid to flush the machine,i would 100percent recommend picking up a bottomless portafilter and a proper basket for this machine a it seems like you are using the pressurised basket you will not get great result with that,thank you for the feedback i now have one indeed much better,hooi ik heb ook een delonghi piston thuis een eci 341 de koffie is echter altijd bitter ik doe altijd 1 schepje koffie en stamp deze zachtjes aan en laat hem dan doorlopen met een eindresultaat van 30ml koffie voor mijn cappuccino ik krijg die bitterheid alleen niet weg tip,hi nicky je kan proberen om wat meer koffie te gebruiken en of het aantal ml te verkleinen tot bijvoorbeeld 18 20ml meer langer contact meer bitterheid mocht dit niet voor je werken kun je ook kijken voor een andere koffie denk aan een 100percent arabica koffie in supermarkt koffies zit vaak ook robusta wat bitterder is dan arabica koffie,i am learning,dutch home barista yes thanks,good to hear,perfect,thanks aerin,the turn on my filter seems to be very stiff any idea why it is bran new,hi dominic i have no idea if you doubt you can go back with the machine,why did you steam a separate jug just to clean it,transfering the milk make the milk more smooth and the second

a different shell on it though the user replied that it worked for them anyway got ta be worth a shot before sending the unit back,i actually saw this problem on another video and the video creator said to wait until the milk frothing light stop flashing before frothing if that light is flashing it mean it is not ready to froth and you have to wait until it stop flashing and remains lit,i am just a user of the machine and have no relation with delonghi but it sound like there is something wrong with our machine you should check your warranty,nope how disappointing i have this delonghi machine too unfortunately it is the same subpar cremma i wish i would have purchased the gaggia classic pro i have never seen so much cremma produced from an expresso machine the gaggia machine is

18g so what is the solution thanx,alessandro cini and do you get double shot for that i mean if u use 14 g do you still need to get 28 g of espresso to have all the three flavor f the coffee sourness

of this shot wa way to long but it wa okay a a latte i use his machine only for single shot is,nice video btw which grinder is that,dutch home barista thank you,thanks the ginder is the gufu lorenzo

coffee extraction when it wa choking like in the video i thought it is wrong i thought coffee should extract rather fluently am i wrong or this is actually correct please i am newbie thanks,the choking wa my mistake normaly i use the two cup button and stop the extraction on 25 gram of coffee in this video i accidentaly used the single cup button which resulted in to litte coffee therefore i pressed it twich this is the choking part the extraction in this video is far from ideale the hand grinder i used grind to fine or to course best to aim for 20 25 gram output in 25 30sec,ohh wow

is heating up the silvia wand take longer practice it took me a few week to master it the trick for me wa to place the tip just on the surface of the milk in an angle that make the milk spin,hi the steam wand you purchased it separately or come with the delonghi machine my wife bought the same machine but the wand is the basic one we could not get that kind of foam,i purchased it separately i t a rancilio silvia v1 v2 steam wand you can buy the wand on ebay or anazon on youtube there are video is on how to do the modification it is are a bit technical but not that hard to do it took me 30

steamed milk,do you add sugar to your coffee,,pokong cheong hi pokong see the link below for the youtube guide i used,dutch home barista could you share how to replaced,yes i replaced the original steam wand by a rancilio silvia steam wand,what milk do you use for latte art also what grind setting do you use,i use whole milk regarding the grind setting best to aim for 25 30sec brewing time,hello i am thinking to get this one is it easy to replace the steam wand i just want to buy practice for latte art do you think is it good enough for that,to replace the steam wand you have to be a bit technical there are good step by step video on youtube to guide you it took me about 20 30 minute a you can see you can make latte art on this machine but it is a entry level machine and need more practice,awesome video i have been trying to decide between the delonghi and the smeg think i am gon na go with the delongi,the smeg is the same internal machine a this de longhi so the extra cost is only for look,great machine had mine for 3 year will not die,good luck in my experience is the delonghi a geat entry machine,the new wand is thicker and somehow different what are your thought on that,hi victor if you mean the new rancilio silvia want model i do not have experience with it,that wa awful just from looking at the shot the grind doe not look fine enough or the coffee bean are not great is under extracted the initial pour should be much darker and thicker another indicator is the lack of any of proper crema you just have a bit of foam why on earth would you stop the shot then add more water that extra pre infusion and water would make your most definitely sour shot taste even worse just set your single espresso shot to run a bit longer if you want a bit more water,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,delonghi is italian in name only all their espresso machine are made in china and do not last long because of that they use cheap component for everything just like saeco and phillips my advice is to get true italian machine like the one from rancilio they are expensive but they will last like 20 year if you want something that is quality and will last long avoid good made in china especially espresso machine,i think there is a confusion i am a home barista making video on my delonghi ec685 espresso machine i do not have any relationship with a espresso machine manufacturer,what grinder is this,the ginder is a gefu lorenzo,can i ask u something the 9g is it double basket or single basket also why change the wand i put my wand just at that level with the default wand and it splattered the milk everywhere i thought my technique is wrong,alexander khioe maybe the type of bean or the grind size ha something to do with it i use fine grind 9 gram is the maximum i can use in the single basket the maximum coffee i can put in the double basket is 14grams,dutch home barista will search for that anyway how would u even fit 9g of coffee bean in a single basket i am fitting 10g in double basket 7g in a single basket if i try to go more than that the portafilter wont snap to the machine,for 9gram i use the single basket the rancilio silvia steam wand is longer and give more focused power my experience is that the rancilio silvia wand need more practice but after i mastered it my micro foam wa much better i also made a steaming video search for how to steam and froth milk with a delonghi ec680 ec685,very nice thank you for the tutorial,your welcome,why did you pour the milk in the other pitcher before making latte art,this make the milk smoother for latte art,too tedious what u did to make a cup really,a long a the taste is good,you change your wand right,i replaced the original wand by a rancilio silvia steam wand you can buy the wand on ebay or anazon on youtube there are video is on how to do the modification if you are a bit technical but not that hard to do it took me 30 minute,very nice vid but for my machine it real quick for cool down blinking started after i purge out some water from the wand so i need to purge again n reselect the steam option could you help,sound like there is maybe something wrong with you machine on my delonghi i do experience inconsistency in steam pressure and temperature when steaming when that happens i just keep on steaming and the pressure recovers afther a couple of second if steam option stop out of it own then maybe it is good to check your machine,it wa nicer latter art than other youtubers in this machine,thanks it took me a lot of practice,nice video what kind of milk are you using regular 1percent or 2percent,the more fat the smoother and richer the foam is,thanks i use whole milk 3percent fat,i think i need te practice more can you make a video on how to steam the milk,nice milk you make,nice tutorial thank you for making it
