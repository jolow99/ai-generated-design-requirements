have the gram dama sadly they discontinued this machine i have had this model for 10 year and 7 year ago i had to buy a new one we went out of town and there wa a bad storm and damaged it it would no

sometimes starting again right after preparing a drink it is also releasing some steam from the steam wand in the heating up process i have always cleaned and descaled it regularly i have also a brand new milk jug do you guy have any suggestion please hello guy i just bought this coffee machine and after the first start showing the general alarm message i already cleared the machine what can be the problem thank you for your help thank you very much guy you save my budget really helpful hi guy thanks a lot for the very good and complete video i have a problem with my machine no water come out of it and a very strong noise is made with some different message could i give you more information to get some more help thanks in advance for your help kind regard awesome guy i had a great time watching amp listening and cleaning my machine along with you but it still do not work what is wrong with it broooo thanks a lot this help me a lot cheer thank you guy you are awesome so much needed this video why ha not delonghi posted one like it a brilliant machine supplying me with my daily drug supply wonderful freshly ground coffee nicely made machine too so you saved my bacon when the fragile control button plastic moulded ispring lever broke of the on off button broke after 9 glorious year of fault free use i am not complaining easy to take apart and reassemble with your superb video i am writing to delonghi so suggest they offer you both honorary vice presidentship of the company best wish thank you for the video it ha helped me in the past with cleaning my perfecta i have the same machine recently it ha gotten very very very slow 2 5 minute per coffee not so perfecta anymore here is a video of the problem any idea btw i have cleaned my infuser in the same way a you have done it in your video our pleasure believe it or not do it again a you know overtime the water cool down so run it a second time and the infuser should be back to normal happy we can help good luck shopper therapy i have cleaned the infuser a recommended let it soak in hot water forever in excess of one hour in upright position before brushing it and i must say it ha dramatically improved the flow the same coffee that yesterday took 2 5 minute to make took roughly 25 second today and the flow ha changed from dripping to streaming although not back to original spec at least i now know that the infuser is wa the likely culprit i will also descale today and clean some other part to complete the cleaning cycle thanks for your great help shopper therapy descaled 4 5 day ago i will try to clean the infuser again give it extra quality time in the tall bowl in upright position and report back once completed thanks for the input sometimes we just have to go to basic i would let the infuser sit in hot water for st least an hour i stead of the traditional period also i would try to use gravity in our favour get yourself a bowl or cup tall enough to hold the infuser in it right up position while it is soaked that might help the situation when is the last time you descaled it shopper therapy i am wondering what else could slow the flow if everything else work perfectly fine but not the coffee making part rinsing a you probably observed is at full flow this video ha been so useful thank you hi i have a delonghi esam 5500 but it ha recently come up with heating message and it get stuck on heating message and will not do nothing any india is what this could be thanks marco my machine is nearly 10 year old now and just recently the ground have not been landing in the container they just fall down to the right hand side and it is a real mess to keep cleaning up any idea i do not think we are capable of taking the machine apart a in this video it look too technical i suspect it might be the diffuser arm not working properly it swipe over the top of the diffuser after the drink is done removing the coffee cake watched the whole video and cleaned my machine thank you super helpful thanks guy hi great video i have a slightly different model ecam 20 110 but i think they are quite similar inside i have had one before that died after 14 month and my current model is 16 month old and seem to get the same problem when the machinemis turned on the cleaning cycle start normally and the wather is pumped into the machine however it doe not run thru coffee nozzle but is running into the tray in the bottom it malkes the coffee and at turn off the cleaning cycle repeat and clean the nozzle at the end this will also stop and nozzle are stuck sending the machine to the repairshop is more expensive than bying a new machine so i really would appreciate any idea it is probably just a small silicone ring that is broken thanks hi i have a question i use this exact coffee machine and when i make espresso and set the desired amount of coffee amount of liquid not how strong the coffee is and it make it sometimes like it should and most of the time it make le than it should i e 0 5dcl is desired and the machine make only 0 3dcl anyone had this one is there a repair review which cover no hot water coming out of my esam 5500 and also the coffee is only just warm can not get it hot all three setting seam the same temperature if your not getting water from the water spout and the espresso spout then you either have a clog or the pump is dead either or i suggest at this point to take in for service shopper therapy hi when press the button nothing come out when you press the water spout button do you get hot water from it shopper therapy hi no water coming out make a noise but nothing happens then say ground too fine is the water coming out or is it coming out but it is cold this is really helpful thanks for sharing it is our pleasure just two word thank you our pleasure thx i am 64yr old woman and i took machine apart and fixed the switch thx to this video amazing that is why we want to make more video like this my machine is dripping espresso slow and the amount is a lot le than usual i did the descale and the cleaning maintenance regularly do you have an idea what could be the problem did you take the door a apart and the nozzle for cleaning good stuff guy and great that this machine is built to be serviceable can i see a big thanks to you guy i had the problem where it leak led behind the back of the spout and constantly asked to be emptied this is a keeper our pleasure hi i purchased this model used and hot water doe not come out of the water spout the espresso work fine tried to descale but again nothing came out clogged tube somewhere it is most likely more then a pocket i really doubt you have a clog you mostly like have a big air leak these thing are designed like a straw if there is air then the suction will not be good if your comfortable take all three panel out and watch the water path you should see up to to where it go this way you eliminate at least up to that point the air leak area then analyze the rest of the path shopper therapy yes i can hear it trying to pump water but nothing come out delonghi said they think there could be some air pocket in the tube but i have tried more than 10 time and nothing when you press the hot water button do you hear the pump starting up it is a very distinct loud sound guy thanks for the great video it helped me a lot in cleaning my machine regard from the netherlands peter hey guy great information in this video i have that exact machine for a couple of year now and have been very happy with it until the other day i started getting a message grind too fine adjust mill and insert water spout i did everything it said to no avail the grinder work fine but when it come to pouring out the coffee nothing come out it sound very weak and then then a loud continuous clicking sound until the pouring cycle end any advice thanks in advance my machine wa stuck on heating up so i replaced the shorted out boiler the infuser wa also moving up and down when the unit wa turned on off i also checked the mainboard triacs by removing them from the mainboard and checking it with a multimeter they were fine so i put them back on the board the machine now go to self diagnosis and then general alarm a couple second later all my element fuse and pump are fine i am thinking the main board is faulty but i still do not know why the infuser motor wa working initially during heating up and now everything seems dead have you ever come across a problem like this i believe one of the surface mount triacs is currently shorted out or even the voltage regulator is not regulating the correct voltage for the processor to start properly i will have to check the voltage later and see what is faulty in the circuit shadowxgfx then i agree most likely a faulty board it is not doing a self diagnosis it doe not detect that the infuser ha been removed unfortunately not the only thing i would check is to remove the infuser and start it up and see if it detects it is missing or doe it loop to the same problem sorry that i can not help much thanks for this video i had coffee coming out of one noozle only i just cleaned inside the door following your instruction and saved money and hassle problem sorted thanks a lot can you please make a video of replacing a few of the part like that plastic piece you mentioned that wa causing a leak could not find anything online when i make coffee the ground do not all go into the container they are all over the place someone said to make the coffee setting weaker ha anyone else had this problem the machine is a slightly older model than shown in the video yes good idea thank you again in that case i would suggest to go to an authorized repair center and find out if they have a spare infuser to try before committing to purchase a new one might be worth spending a few dollar more just to try good luck and let u know i really appreciate your reply and your trying to help i tried the setting but everything is the same i am thinking of buying a new infuser and hoping this solves the problem i would renovate the infuser but it look a bit complicated for me i am not comfortable doing it in case i mess it up i will let you know if the new infuser work thank you again for trying to help princess yevisha it could be either the latch on the infuser is not pushing the puck but it could also be the bean grinder is not compacting the grind inside your bean bin there are should be a grinding knob now depending on your model the lower the number the finer the grind or higher the number thicker the grind increase it accordingly and make sure it is on the thicket setting then try again they used to be whole but now they are broken up and moist i usually rinse the infuser and occasionally soak it in hot water a per your video after making coffee the infuser is caked in wet coffee it seems that half the puck is in the container and half in the tray the infuser move slightly but i have not got a hex screwdriver to tighten the screw behind it great video guy i used it to fix my perfecta that had started dripping from the back of the retractable dispenser same here awesome video and very easy step by step instruction with key area highlighted i would pause when needed and go back to watch the key point again thanks heap that is why we are here if we can help even one person we have done our job great video wa looking for a way to fix my broken power button this video is gold hi there i hope you can help u our maschine make no more coffee you can hear the grinder but then it stopps and want a refill of the bean the container is full so no coffee what can we do to fix it nice good stuff guy fixed my door issue thanks to this vid hey i got a leaking my esam 5500 i have located it it is above the water tank a beige plastic connector i have video can you talk to me hey timothy what is up hmm okay seems there are more video out there i searched for my problem long time ago the first time i had that problem i send the whole machine to a local service provider and they fixed it i fount no solution that time now i found a youtube video and maybe that will fix my problem and even yours if you get this problem i do not want to post a direct link but just look for delonghi esam 5600 coffee machine milk frother froth foam how to repair not frothing failure solved on yt there is a tiny spare part that will do the trick hey guy thanks for this great video got the same machine and had some of those problem too now after more than 1 year i got another problem milk when i want to get some creamy fluffy milk the pump start but can not pump the milk up in the inside of the machine so all i get is air and some condensewater how i clean the inner part of the milk system i always use the cleaning function i often clean the milk container got 2 of them and i use the delonghi milk cleaning stuff 10ml and 90ml water to clean the inside i tried ti clean inner part but i didnt found where maybe you can help out have you tried to flip the straw and push it in harder also the spout of the container and the lever can be pulled out of the lid did you clean those item al loose or did you put it in a a whole also we will check out the other video thanks amazing video guy if i have water leaking under the boiler area area you see when you open machine and eventually under the machine do you think it an orange o ring issue hey mix triplequad here the best way to visualize a leak is an actual rinse run or coffee run now only if you feel comfortable you should try the following again comfort and caution is required a you will be powering on the system while the panel are out and you can get hurt take off the back panel and side panel dry and clean the entire system place the unit whereas you can actually be looking at the backside of the system comfortably but the front side is still accessible then fill the water container put the tray and the bin back in and close the door plug the unit then turn it on pay attention to where the leak is coming from if you do not see it press the rinse button and watch it if you still do not see press the cappuccino button make sure you have a cup for it lol when you identify the leak if it at a junction point then most likely it an oring if that the case you will need to pull the metal clip take the oring out you should be able to see the oring either severely scratched or cracked one advise do not buy orings from home depot go to an authorized service center and get one because these orings are designed to sustain high heat and do not leach chemical in your drink sorry for the delay mixinmark1 most likely any leaking is due to something like that i would bet it is an o ring u need to change when the light come on and the infuser unit is in the down position it make normal initial noise and then it strain and screech a it go up and the triange light come on with the 2 cup light i have changed the o ring and lubricated the infuser unit and all i can get to without taking the generator out what do you think is going on all my light come on when i plug it in and push the on button then all the light go off sometimes the red triangle come on i cleaned and lubricated the infuser it just doesnt stay on occasionally it make a struggling noise before all the light go off occasionally the water work but nothing else but mine is a magnifico texasandres sure post a video would be easier to see we do not repair we just do review and minor repair video for people could i post a video of the light and sound and see what you think do you repair where do you rec a repair place that is worth the cost thats exactly what happens what would make the diagnostics fail texasandres sorry to hear this honestly sound like either a computer issue or one of the internal device is failing the self diagnostics when you unplug the unit and plug it back in you should see it doing a self diagnostics it most likely fails it is not something we can help you you would need to take it in to service sorry for the bad news however thanks this is a great vid esra toop my guess is that they are very similar but i can not promise anything a i have never opened one up is the delonghi magnifica bean to cup the same mechanism i have the same problem after only 3 4 cup of coffee the red light come up and it doe not matter how many time i clean the infuser it will not switch off great video guy thank you i have exactly the same model and the water leak whenever i descale or make cappuccino but it doe not leak when making espresso i followed your video to open up the machine made a cup of cappuccino to observe the water leak gush out at the part where the black cube sitting over a brass component which ha 2 or 3 water tube connected to it the black cube ha the ceme 120 60 stamped on it can you help to identify the part and perhaps give me some idea where to start checking i have pic of the spot where the water came out i called delonghi but they never called back thanks hai hdpsr7 sorry for the late reply we suggest you call delonghi and only ask them to give you you local authorized service provider number and address call them and you will likely be able to get the exact part you need from them guy greeting and thanks from the uk my machine is about seven year old now and had previously been sent away to be cleaned amp serviced at a cost of gbp70 when the coffee flow started puking out the back of the nozzle it just started to do this again i did not fancy that cost again so thought i would have a go at cleaning it properly myself your video on how to take it all apart and take the door off etc gave me the confidence to have a go and it worked perfectly a nice clean flow of hot coffee again will make sure i give it a more thorough clean now cheer jon swatton glad we can help thanks so much great video guy can you help the temperature light flash for a long time then i get the warning triangle coffee temperature ha not been warm for month now been re heating in the microwave linda hone sorry we never got the notification for your comment at 8 14 we point out the heating element this is what you need to replace or get repaired
