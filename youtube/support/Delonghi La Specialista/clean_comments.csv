1,barista pro la specialista prestigio a an amazon associate i earn from qualifying purchase,this is not a review it a breville add lol,nope expressed pro and con for both,this is an amazing comparison you lay everything out so clearly and also give the way the difference affect the end result i love the feature on the delonghi and also the classic look but breville doe seem to be the superior machine here awesome job,thanks jonny glad it wa helpful,in france you would pay up to 850euros dollar923 for the prestigio in this price range it is unacceptable to have an imprecise grinder also i though it wa all metal before i watched this video covering plastic with fake chrome paint is so cheap i can not help but despising them for such a low blow how can you trust a brand after this btw in this price range you can buy a second hand mignon grinder and a brand new la pavoni or full metal lelit pl41 no brainer thanks for this excellent video,i agree with many of your thought on these machine i hate plastic chrome it make the unit feel cheap like i do not however agree with you that the onboard tamp is a positive channeling is a killer for me this addition just add to my work flow very surprised with the number negative for me with the delonghi thanks for the review cheer from canader eh,breville is better then specialista,yes that wa the outcome of this video,thank you very much it is so helpful,i could not agree with u more,to the lucky folk who own either of these beauty could someone confirm for me if you can hook up a water line these guy really do not feel like filling up water on a weekly basis,lifestyle lab thanks for the quick response mean a lot a i try to find the system that fit our need,ecm la speciale rocket the model page will tell you if they are plumbable or not i believe the lelit bianca is plumable a well,lifestyle lab any brand you would recommend,no neither of these can be plumed in unfortunately you have to go well upmarket to find machine that can be plumbed in,i think that breville should stick with toaster and leave the coffee machine to the professional,and yet they beat the italian here,the italian design build quality and feature have me with delonghi any day every breville coffee machine i have had just doe not last and fails with issue at every turn delonghi machine do what they say they will do and last long enough to enjoy them,i wish i can buy the blue breville unfortunately it is not available in australia,australia doe not get the blue colour,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,hi thanks for the video i would like to ask you if i can grind bean for filter v60 coffee on barista pro thanks for your answer,no it can not go coarse enough,i wa able to redistribute the grind and use the tamp manually on the delonghi machine by turning the dosage off on the dial i would suggest that you read the manual a it can be done without turning the machine off a mentioned in your video also here in oz there is a remarkable price difference dollar400 aud between the two that what swayed me towards the delonghi,this is the same number of step a turning the machine on and off and cause you to lose your dose dial position in most market the delonghi is slightly more expensive,doe anyone ever use the machine for starting a small coffeeshop business,no these are not appropriate for commercial use,great video i have a gift card for the de longhi do you know what is the largest ounce of americano it make i am excited for this review it seems to be great,you missed a bit they are so over priced,the delonghi certainly is i would disagree that the barista pro is overpriced,now would it be better 2 get 1 of these 2 machine or the gaggia classic pro with a grinder all would be about same price,lifestyle lab awesome thanks for ur help,depends what drink you primarily make just espresso quality will be better with the gaggia and a seperate grinder however if you steam lot of milk the braista pro is considerably faster,i have a stupid question on the delonghi would not it be easier scooping the bean from the grinder when removing the lid than taking them out when the entire top portion of the grinder is removed,it can but there is another non removable guard that stop you from getting them all out you will still have 100g or so left that will come splitting out,lifestyle lab maybe i did not make myself clear before i am referring to the cover that is taken off to fill the bean can not that cover be taken off so the bean could be scooped out to replace with new bean,not a stupid question grinder will ofter have burr guard or anti popcorn cone that cover the main chute making that not possible,great video please help when making a double shot espresso on the breville barista pro it stop after 15 second ive tried different grind setting and still the same how can i get the perfect double shot,you need to program the machine to run the shot longer using the programming mode,i had owned all model of breville coffee machine including the oracle and after a short break with coffee i bought the delonghi delonghi surprised me with the quality of milk it wa able to produce a well a the day to day consistency of the grinder espresso extraction timing and quality i am happy with it and will be looking to get the ec9665 top model soon,delonghi are cheaply made chinese machine,i bought the delonghi yesterday so far so good,i have the delonghi and you can tamp w o turning it off just set the dosage dial all the way to the left after evening out the grind,1 this would lose your dose setting 2 this is the same number of step a turning the machine off on,you can redistribute the dose manually and prevent further grinding by lifting the tamper handle slightly off the microswitch i do that every time,nice review bought one myself couple a month ago no need to switch off the machine for tamping turn the knob to dosing powder then grinding is off,except this will lose your dosing position and is the same number of step a just turning off the machine briefly,you do not have to turn off the delonghi to re tamp you could just move and leave leave the tamping lever to a vertical position not returning it to the horizontal that disables the grinder until the tamping lever is returned to it horizontal position personally i prefer to use a leveller redistributer after which you may not even need to tamp if you have enough dose the bean in the hopper thing is a bit annoying but then when i used to use breville grinder removing the hopper wa a pita to put back on anyway for home use i see no advantage to having a lot of bean in the hopper in the first place with the delonghi you can have just a few bean in the hopper and it will warn you if it think there are not enough bean to deliver a full dose there is a huge benefit to consistent dosing i had ton of setting on my breville grinder but the setting had a lot of slop and tended to drift so did not help much i hated the slow breville steamer because it introduced too much water into the milk i find it interesting that this review managed to make it look like these feature difference favored the breville,once you have used both machine you know the key advantage of delonghi is the integrated tamper with the sensor grinder it definitely minimises the mess and it is a win in long run if you do drink coffee everyday with your family,brevilles response is 3k only reason why i went with the delonghi tired of messy puck set ups,yes but a lifestyle lab pointed out the coffee is not evenly distributed and if you tamp down on it like that you will not get a good extraction a others have pointed out you can just lift the tamping lever to perhaps slightly past vertical remove the portafiler and redistribute the coffee and retamp this doe not make much mess especially since the sensor grinder dosed just about the right amount of coffee,those two feature are absolutely awesome wish more brand would integrate something similar,just got finished packing up the prestigio unpacking the barista touch and pulled a couple lukewarm shot i am scratching my head and thinking wtf have i done the prestigio is most certainly 100percent higher quality and i bought the upgraded version of the pro he featured in this review comparison the portafilter is much heavier by 16percent to be specific the whole machine is at least 10lbs heavier the water tank is better designed and more robust and the drip tray is by far a huge step up on the de longhi and the tamping system once you have it geez i do not know if i can be without it now it is so fast and clean and the smart grinding on the de longhi never overdoses even if you adjust the grind it is magic i feel completely duped by online review like this that put the breville on fake platform above all the others the people that buy a home espresso machine like this want something that is good value for the money reliable simple to use and effective we do not want a damn cafe lab in our kitchen with endless tweaking of this and that the de longhi prestigio did all that with flying color i am upset do not be misled by online review fml,yup the drip tray on my breville is used to drive me nut with their messy cleanup pulling out the delonghi to see hardly any ground and water in it is a joy every time the notion of opening a breville drip tray to get at gadget really made me smile,unfortunately i do not think there is a way to quantify build quality but the filter basket portafilter on the delonghi is very rough to say the least remove the filter basket from both and then re install them the filter on the breville is identical to any standard espresso machine the delonghi is thin flimsy any completely proprietary i am looking at these machine from the perspective of someone who ha owned and reviewed a lot of espresso machine at a variety of price point,lifestyle lab no you shot down the prestigio on build quality and that is not fair and not a true representation i own many breville appliance 8 not including this touch machine so i am a dollarupporter but you got this one wrong man just own it v defend,the barista pro is a more capable machine when it come to drink quality hand down the prestigio is more convenience oriented this wa clearly explained in this video if you are getting lukewarm shot on the breville the portafilter wa likely not adequately warmed it should be hot to the touch this is true for any espresso machine you have not been duped or lied to you just need to learn to properly use the machine,do not buy this machine you do not use very specific bean lt it will jam the machine if you use even slightly oily bean and warranty will be void do not buy,that is not at all true,i have the delonghi she is perfect you love breville your not objectiv,then why doe my latest video recommend a different delonghi over a breville just because i did not pick the machine you own doe not make my review not objective or true sorry friend,nice video,which dosing cup have you gone for to use with the breville doe anyone have a link what size fit,here is a full list of accessory,i have had several breville espresso product in the past 8 year and i can say that brewille is much much nicer and it doe worth the money after all it pay you back in no time compared to paying for coffee at coffee shop,absolutely just understand that it is a learning process,doe it make coffee a good a coffee shop though i spend dollar5 almost daily on starbucks and i guess i do not understand much about making your own espresso so with no knowledge about espresso or how to use the machine do you think i would be able to make coffee a good a coffee shop,very informative and skilled young man you definitely knowwhat he talk about i have decided to buy a machine after going through my bill and found out that i am spending minimum 150 euro a month on nespresso capsels i am tempted to buy a pre owned miel 6350 under two year old brewed about 2000 unit for the amount of 350 euro but i am also looking at the sage barista pro semi automatic and therefore more work and it take also more attention from me but what about the tasete the quality of the espresso for my latte i only drink latte and always added with sugar is the semi granding me a better coffee or is the difference in taste so little that it is not the effort of doing the grinding and stamping my self worth what doe other people here think pls,bonjour i bought the delonghi is prestigio a couple of week while ago since i watched your video i understand why each cup of coffee with the same setting doe not taste the same turning off the machine before tempering is indeed a solution but for such an expensive machine pfffff what a disappointment i also noticed that when i have finally found the perfect setting for a great cup of single expresso and i push on 2 for a double the amount of coffee that come out is not the double of the weight of a single i am not sure to be clear enough that mean that the pressure change and that i get a complete different taste did you notice anything like that a third thing that i noticed ha to do with the steam nozzle the result of the milk froth is not always the same have of the time i get a result although i make it exactly the same way of course i tried many time with different kind of milk a you understand i am not satisfied at all with this machine and i regret i bought it could you please tell if you have noticed anything of what i wrote thanks juliette,very nice video it helped me figure out some stuff about my new la specialista machine i would have a question though is it normal that the pressure is under the optimal zone when i choose the coffee setting instead of espresso i am not changing anything else i would say it is normal because it doe not taste sour like an under extracted espresso shot but i may be wrong,yes it normal,great job very impressive,thanks for the informative video one thing with the tamping with the delonghi thee are two way of tamping without grinding either turn the dose knob all the way off to the little icon or just leave the lever party engaged both will stop the grinding also there appears to be a setting to change the grind not sure yet what that doe,rob mcqualter all you need is some after market attachment buy a dosing funnel,rob mcqualter yes the cleanliness of the delonghi compared to the breville i used to own or even the fully automatic delonghi i used to own is profound,for me upgrading from a pod machine the coffee quality is so much better the mess of tamping turned me off my basic espresso machine year ago so the cleanliness of the delonghi is a clear winner for me thanks for your balanced review that make it clear what feature may matter for different people,i see you have answered that before the second option to leave the tamping lever half engaged should be better than turning off the machine,nice review appreciate it,i bet you work for breville cause this is the second video ive seen from you trying to promote breville and ignore the good feature on delonghi good luck,i will see what i had both of them side by side in my kitchen for a month i like how some people is immediate reaction to any sort of conclusive video is that there must be fraud involved by that logic do i also work for ember mug do i also work for rocket when i said their build quality kick the crap out of breville do i also work for gaggia when i said it is better value for money over the rancilio man i must be one corrupt guy,lifestyle lab just get one you will see,what feature did i ignore,great review clear and concise i love the delonghi is shiny sliver industrial looking machine that would look great in my kitchen however the breville seems to be the best machine for actually making coffee i like coffee and making it but am no expert so it would be a battle between my head and my heart to see which machine i parted my hard earned cash for,michael p smith thank you i did not realise that i have not upgraded my coffee machine yet but if when i do i will factor in the fact that the breville is available in chrome,you probably already know but the breville come in chrome a well,8 grind step are shit do not buy a delonghi,do not go for design,thank you for nice comparison for me clear winner delonghi because grinder work without any mess two home use only machine also i have full automatic crups machine with only 5 grind setting and believe me it work fine for making nice espresso this new model updated prestigio wa much improved machine will update my note after some use my delonghi on delivery already,regarding your comment of not being able to remove the coffee after grinding to redistribute if you grind the bean then after this ha finished move the dose dial to the pre ground setting you can remove the portafilter to redistribute the ground before replacing the portafiler to tamp without it grinding again only a small point but important to note thanks for the review,lifestyle lab good shout i did not think of that issue a i have the maestro which give you the dosing amount on an led screen i personally use my own wdt and tamper if i am making espresso but tend to use the built in one for the semi automatic milk drink if i am being lazy,yes but this result in the same number of step a just turning the machine off and you will likely shift your dose amount slightly each time so i thought the method i showed wa a bit better,are you sponsored by breville sage,no that is my fault it is because i usually tend to skip the whole intro part of any youtube video to avoid unnecessary introduction perhaps i should do that le frequently thanks for the fast clarification anyway,nope that would need to be disclosed did you listen to my very clear disclaimer at the beginning of the video,delonghi crap breville good done,i went to bed bath and beyond a few day ago and i compared the la specialista prestigio v the barista pro i think the delonghi ha a much higher build quality it is full stainless steel instead of the plastic feeling of the barista pro also the delonghi is much bigger and heavier with better build quality to the touch,the barista pro is an all metal shell just in a matte painted finish it is also available in plain stainless steel,that is the best review thank you,regarding the la specialista prestigio there actually is a way to grind pull out to redistribute and tamp afterwards without turning off the machine you just have to rotate the very left wheel used for dose quantity to the bottom left symbol that avoids the auto grinding when putting in the portafilter,how did i ignore it i said it wa completely unacceptable and that a dosing cup is a necessity,lifestyle lab but you ignore the mess you make with breville i rather push a button to retamp than cleaning up the whole kitchen lol,very true however then you will also be potentially changing your dose because you might not put the dial back to the exact same spot not to mention it the same number of button push in the end whether you turn the machine off then on or turn the dial off then on,what about the claim in the link below that prestigio make a bit sweeter espresso than breville due to new dynamic print fusion and consistent temping a well presigio brewing at 9 bar pressure with breville machine are extracting at 13 15 bar which can create an unpleasant harsh taste in the espresso a well high pressure are not recommended for non pressurized basket,lifestyle lab thanks,yes it definitely tougher to get good shot on the barista express due to the higher pressure many people modify the opv to lower it down,lifestyle lab thank you for the link so what they claim might be true for barista express,no the barista pro measure 9 bar with a blind basket this is the maximum pressure it will ever apply to the puck when the machine is completely choked,lifestyle lab i think the actual brewing pressure will depend on the density of the ground coffee in your basket since breville pro doe not have a pressure gauge you can not be sure what pressure you are brewing at this complicates the process and you guess two variable to get a satisfactory result the complexity let the owner pretend to be an expert but no one can say at what pressure they brew their espresso it can be 6 13 or even 15 bar so it look like they have reason to claim that prestigio make a slightly sweeter espresso since with a pressure gauge you can brew at 9 bar,ordering a pro today,very nice,7 minute 30 second ec9355 why do not you adjust the grinding stop to compress but have to turn off the machine to compress,lifestyle lab nah,because this would mean moving the grinding dial and changing the dose i had dialed in you can try to put the dial back to the same spot but will never get it quite the same,no way we are looking past the de longhi la specialista maestro will you be doing a review on this machine,i do not think i will no at that price range the oracle is head and shoulder above the maestro,is there much difference between la specialista amp prestigio,lifestyle lab hahahahhahahaha,did you watch this video,lifestyle lab is it better in quality,no i recommend buying the barista pro over the la specialista,lifestyle lab so you prefer to buy prestigio i am very undecided prestigio is a bit more expensive idk if it worth,thank you for the video well i do not know if the manual is wrong or my new machine is faulty on page 16 of the manual programming espresso shot the manual say i should hear a beep once i press the button to stop the extraction i do not hear a beep i know it wa programmed because the extraction time that i chose is saved in subsequent shot it is a new machine and if i am suppose to hear the beep i will exchange it can someone assist please by confirming on their machine or follow page 16 of the manual and let me know the result,for the money and getting better shot the barista pro win on about everything just wished they left the pressure gauge on the updated model,great comparison video,great video very clear and good explanation,i have the the delonghi and i do not have a problem with an uneven tamp i have been paying special attention to the tamping since watching this video,it may not look uneven on the surface but without proper distribution there will be some area that are more dense than others,hey man thanks for the video very informative keep up the good work loving your video,can you please review the quick mill pippa semi automatic espresso machine,great video a usual thank you,hmm i would recommend saving up a bit more money and buy a gaggia classic pro and a niche zero and enjoy far far better coffee these all in one machine are good for convenience but a gaggia and a good grinder will always produce a better result,great review really sad they still keep missing the mark on the delonghi cause i think some real competition to breville really doe not exist for built in grinder style machine i have heard the maestro is better but it is way to much money to basically just start competing with the breville barista pro,thanks again i inbnh,how about adjust the grind time to avoid overflowing and mess of the ground coffee just saying,this machine only messy grind like lifestyle lab said unacceptable or you need to buy sone accessory or use separate grinder,because you need to dose the proper amount for the filter basket you can not compromise that just to avoid a mess,well produced and informative video thank you,ha been having the barista pro for a few month enjoying every second of it a great espresso machine that ha all the basic feature and at a reasonable price,been through many happy with pro hoping doe not break like all the others,monic macenki 30sec,hello can you make coffee after 3 second it wa hot or you have to wait 15 minute to get started making coffee,your video is very informative and it help me a lot while i am deciding which one to purchase,good video i disagree on one point though from a human interface point of view it is not a draw at all the delonghi only win on having a one button push for making an americano the breville win on everything else,the only flaw i see with the barista pro is that the cup warmer doe not warm the cup the group head is not warmed a in the bbe this is due to the heating mechanism which begs the question why have a cup warmer that doe not do what it need to do,lifestyle lab exactly but if you are in a hurry hot water from the spout can speed thing up,i agree a definite con of a thermoblock thermojet heating system,the breville is portafilter is a weapon,and the milk steam,spectacular video i like the way you present your video in a very attractive manner very informative especially for a non native english speaker such a myself greeting from saudi arabia and god bless you,greeting from canada thanks for watching,really like your video i have the bbe but think the pro user interface make it easier to use but when they have the bbe on sale a lot of the time for dollar200 off it is hard to beat for someone just starting and if you drink milk based drink it ha i think everything you need hope you are able to start visiting coffee roasting shop really like see the different roast coffee out their keep up the great work,hopefully we will start getting back out in the new year just added another place to the growing list of roaster to visit,wow you were so nice to the delonghi haha great video breville win in my book,your video are really educating me while i discover what is really important for my preference i am realizing i do not need certain feature a i thought i want a really good simple espresso and a separate grinder since my bean alter daily with mood,that is my main goal make sure people get the best machine for them,breville is a really high quality machine,this is a great review you certainly took a much gentler approach to the original laspecialista review however it look like delonghi ha learned a lot since the first gen laspecialista now i wonder is the laspecialista maestro compare well to the more auto machine like the oracle or oracle touch,lifestyle lab i agree i still wonder about the 51mm portafilter why not go with at least 54 but then i guess i could say the same with breville why not go 58mm across the line,nothing make me happier than when company listen to feedback and act on it they still have a way to go with this platform but this wa a step in the right direction,wow great video this summed up my experience with my delonghi in a way i could not quite do myself it wa impressive in some area but not the one that actually mattered most,exceptional video a per usual the original la specialista wa my first espresso machine which i very quickly outgrew moving to a barista express then a dual boiler although the prestigio ha brought in some good change i genuinely would recommend against the purchase of this machine if you are even the slightest espresso hobbyist despite my strongly worded comment i should note that the machine did look beautiful and had a very durable build quality,it is interesting because looking online it look like an amazing machine and good looking but i am so glad i watched these video went with the barista express and i love it,nice one,brenda king am cosindering barista pro but la specialista seems great,in the coffee maker market are ya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,i have loved mine bought in in 2019 and am so happy i did,drink every time she say yup,de longhi ec9355m la specialista i just opened followed the step for initial rise but system will not come out of the orange ok light and continues to run through the rinse cycle any idea how to get this machine running,how doe this compare to the breville barista touch,tchibo is good machine,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,fyi to everyone if you buy this machine there a chance the machine will not work a in the water wont flush and just make noise when you hit the hot water tea button and it take them more than a day to get back to you on the phone,is this made in italy,do you just add more water to make a normal cup of coffee if you want,this video rock 10 out of 10 best i have watched showing me how to use a la specialista very informational giving good and useful detail without crazy annoying music or obnoxious host thanks so much for making this video and sharing,i bought this machine it is a challenge to learn well they make it sound so simple it is a learning curve they need a video from unpacking to use,thanks guy very useful video now i understand how to program my coffee maker,i wa on board until you said pressurized basket out,bought this machine based on the recommendation of this channel we really like it although lately while frothing the milk bubble up over the pitcher before you can remotely get it hot enough not sure if it is because the milk is too cold the type of milk we have been using or because we have not recently descaled the machine ha this happened to any of you,part of the problem wa the wand wa not on properly but i still occasionally have this issue recently i switched to a larger frothing pitcher which help our fridge seems to freeze the milk sometimes which could also be a contributing factor,if it is still an issue try submerging the wand deeper into the milk over bubbling tends to happen if you get too much air in there you want to look for a few sip of air instead of a continuous gurgling and sipping easy way to do it first incorporate air into the milk and submerge the wand when the milk is volume is a you desire the wand should not make any sipping noise a of now but only stir the milk and create a vortex,put le milk,my wife bought this for me because i am a coffee lover and former professional barista having a job in an espresso shop downtown chicago honestly i believe that zone dial is there for show no matter how many time i tried changing bean and setting that dial never get into the optimal zone also my machine is way louder than yours on camera especially in foam mode what is up with that,i do not get into optimal zone either,for anyone looking to buy a new coffee machine i have used the la specialista for about 6 month now and i would give it a full four and a half star i have had some troubleshooting issue such a the coffee grind amount different coffee bean seems to affect it and the milk though it wa fine once i started doing it on a 45 degree angle no problem since then but all in all it is pretty good and make some decent coffee coming from a coffee snob living in nz and the coffee here is very good i have not given it a full five star rating because i have a feeling that it will not last for more than a standard 3 5year it is not built to last though i hope i am wrong on that one someone said in the comment that people seem to have a bias towards breville bought a cheap breville for work and it definitely make good coffee maybe not a much a the la specialista but pretty damn close for a fraction of the price also it seems like it is built to last no fancy button but it doe the job is not that just what we want so bottom line is you do not need to spend dollardollardollar buying an espresso machine bear that in mind next time you shop for one happy day,is this good for commercial use or just personal home use only,for me gail is the best person seattle coffee gear ha to demonstrate any and all the machine you guy have she is of course very experienced but most importantly she is clear speaking cutting through very well to the listener making it very easy to distinguish from different machine and make good buying decision a far a the other spoke person they are good but they stand a very far second place to gail on everything about demonstration on coffee machine i am sorry that i am so blunt and honest about this but seattle coffee gear is the one doing the sale not me i do not know what they would be without gail when she retires and i hope that answer is never,this video is a turn off want an independent review after gail is twentieth yep i turn this video off yep,my husband brought me a delonghi and i love it so far so good,you charge 700 pound for this a price way higher than the stonkingly good sage breville barista express and you only give pressurised basket are you serious hard pas,i wanted to read that review it is a good featured machine with a lot of item i wished he had done a capuccino to check out how dense the frothed milk came out with fhat advanced frothing system a always gail you do the best machine and technique review regard to arizona were you live now,if the machine grind and tamp properly there is no need for a pressurized basket that seem poorly thought out,he called it a manual machine what rubbish i hate this push button automatic lazy era everything is being de skilled although coffee making is one thing you can not successfully automate only a minority seem to want to put effort into doing anything properly these day get a sage barista express before they are phased out for the digital counterpart or get a pro machine,where to put water,with a pressurised basket and a very average grinder that is too course for real espresso this machine is not very good no wonder they had to invite the rep on to help cover thing up for the price this is a very disappointing machine and a disappointing sellout review,i do feel sorry for anyone who bought that machine based on this video look like they tried to make an oracle clone but it not much better than a normal fully automatic bean to cup machine,this is awkward lol,i have this machine that i just bought but i am having serious problem with the grinding it doe not grind and i do not know what to do,eh no sir that crema doe not look good,thank you,thank you this wa very helpful now i can enjoy my laspecialista,it is truly a thing of beauty,a,it is not working after 4 month and there is no customer service do not buy it,this is the worst machine you can have it is garbage,i just bought this machine and having tough time achieving the optimal zone finest on number 1 and grinding it a few time while adjusting the dial the coffee level on recommended level and above also can not achieve the optimal zone,hey jamie or gal can not you let me know what method you would use with this machine if you wanted to go with a cold style brew,why in the world would you include only pressurized basket on a machine that grind fresh bean that make absolutely no sense and to be honest auto tamp seems nice but i can not trust that the machine is going to dose the coffee corretly i would rather take out the portafilter weigh my dose and dial it in and tamp manually this is a hard pas fo rme,what do u prefer de longhi el specialista or brevel barista,the breville this specialista machine is garbage,this thing just look like a ridiculous piece of junk,pressurized portafilter 51mm basket bad grinder at 900dollar you would be better getting the barista express i sometimes see it at 600 700dollar on amazon,or the barista pro,jesus christ it cost a much a the breville but only come with the mediocre pressurized basket i mean it is decent to use when you do not have fresh coffee but a machine that cost a much should come with at least one non pressurized basket delonghi being cheap nothing new they should stick to making dollar150 maker,pile of junk for this kind of coin i would roll a cafelat robot and a rocky,how to set the coffee strength i e to make it strong or weak,learn the principle of making coffee you will know the answer,grind the coffee coarse for weaker coffee and finer for stronger coffee,i just got mine about a week ago i can not get into the optimal pressure zone despite my coffee level at the marked line of the portafilter amp the grinder set at the finest the extraction is way too fast amp the espresso taste sour may i know your setting that you were able to reach into the optimal pressure zone,theredtech98 i did a such portafilter is full the problem wa to lock the portafiter it became too hard amp almost impossible to get it in locked position i hv to settle with the suboptimal pressure well cappuccinno taste good though,search youtube for how to get into optimal zone a video by ec coffee explains it well basically just increase the grinding dose left knob and it ok if the coffee is a bit over the marked line good luck i just got this machine today to compare it to my barista express,i am looking for a real review sad that this is reviewed with a delonghi representativa there bummer,delonghi and this guy doesnt knew anything about espresso and coffee consumer,pressurized basket on an dollar800 machine is a deal breaker for me the smart tamper is cool but breville barista express to me is a better machine,i think the machine look nice but a a barista i do not think it would be any fun i bought a gaggia classic pro a couple week ago with a stand alone grinder i love it so far much more hand on,i would like a coffee that you use what wa it what brand,i bought one of these recently and so far i like it but dude when ur steaming the milk hold the jug on the palm of ur hand when it is too hot for your hand the milk is at the right temp if you overheat the milk it go bitter,i have had the breville barista for several year now i purchased the delonghi la specialist just recently for my home and took my breville to my office to use i have only had the laspecialist for only 7 month and it leak water from the tank into the tray overflowing onto my counter and floor i contacted delonghi and now i have to send it back for repair or replacement and do not know when i will get it back they told me at delonghi if it could not be repaired they would send me a refurbished one i told them if they sent me a refurbished one i would take them to court i purchased a new one and i expect a new one if they can not fix it i will never purchase another delonghi product again just because of their warranty and customer service i should have purchased another breville barista i never had an issue with breville i own several product from breville and never had a problem,lesson learned i figure,actually after this video i believe denloghi will fire this guy and hire gale,height is 17 5 inch,this is a toy compared to breville barista from coffee taste to build quality also something funny with this guy and excuse me if he is here watching the video usually in this channel people doing review with the negative and positive they do not do advertise we have the tv for that,when i saw it i though it could be a good competitor to barista express but it is not pressurized basket only six setting to the grinder and this milk froth system is a good a the low cost machine they make the only nice thing is the grind to tap they made so glad i bought the barista express,we bought breville and it wa so bad the flow meter wa broken,you know what they say copying is form of flattery,,wow most consumer want pressurized portafilter really that is sad,delonghi is sending me a replacement drip tray on my three month old machine it like to flood my counter and run all over the floor even when the machine is off the right back hole on the drip tray is too small lovely design flaw very disappointed numerous review on line said do not bother return it,i always enjoy your review gail but getting a brand rep to endorse a horrible machine is disappointing to say the least 51 mm pressurized basket that hold 13 gram of coffee for a double shot is a joke please gail make him a real shot and let him taste the difference,pre warning this machine look good but is 90percent plastic muhc better to go with the barista pro from breveil oh yeah same price point,read some of the comment delonghi have been around before breville notice that all brevilles use italian pump why should i go to australia to buy espresso machine and not from those who invented espresso have a lot more basic delonghi espresso machine and ha been serving me well not everybody is skill is equal that is why only pressurized basket and the wand that is actually making the froth art easier for you which actually i am not sure if i like and you see my reason i think myself classical barista i also have a radiator delonghi knock on wood ha been serving me quite efficiently several year in a row niente problemi,if you had visited australia and seen just how seriously people here like coffee along with the number of coffee roaster there is you would understand why most of the big roaster here were established by italian back in the late 50 such a merlo or vittoria so yeah there would be a reason for breville to put out a decent coffee machine,if this had something to take care of the milk i would consider it but in this price range it look like the philip machine will be the one it is not a attractive a this one but it about the coffee really,absolutly baddest show ever see,and more expensive than the barista buuuuuu,latte art not good latte not good of course espresso not good for sure so the whole video is just blah blah blah that guy is just a salesman,yeah they copied the barista express and made it somehow bad wtf hellooooo it doe not matter what feature you have if you start with pressurized filter then that is no especialista at all if you like espresso and you are at this level of espresso maker then forget the pressurized filter and any other crap quality espresso start with fresh bean then you need to figure out grinding dosing and tamping to get the right extraction so if you throw a pressurized filter in the mix just forget all that other stuff by the way the shot they did doe not look great like they were trying to make u believe very little crema look like over extracted which make sense with a pressurized filter now about the advance latte bla bla bla there is a way to texturize milk properly for latte art and it doe not involve any automatic sh t so bla bla bla bla,they may have copied the machine but just like the noodle they perfected it and it is made in italy so therefore it is better and that dude could not sell fire insurance to to someone that wa in a burning house,talk about not knowing the subject delonghi machine are made in china it is only italian in name italian people laugh at delonghi appliance in general because they are mediocre you want something that is truely made in italy gaggia bezzera and la pavoni are your best bet,would like to see a gail review without the company representative there for an objective review,i totaly agree,exactly my thought,lol of hate in the comment section,this machine is perfect for rookie i wa able to pick up a few tip from watching this helpful video thank you,lot of hate on this machine but i have one and i enjoy it,jess wong yes i had that problem and it is a defect with the water tray they replaced it and the problem went away i am enjoying my machine very much,anthony pardo any problem with leakage been reading a lot of review online about it,i have seen this machine in person and played around with it final verdict is the build quality is garbage v a breville the steam arm wa broke fairly quick too it look like a nice machine till you get up close personal and see how cheaply it wa made not worth the price tag,seeking a promo from breville they can send me one to compare i disagree with your assessment,with pressurised basket portafilter is always messy especially with this rubber on bottom of delonghi basket,you can call it delonghi style,only presur filter is not o k,do you sell bottomless portofilter for the especialista,people on here seem pretty partial to breville i just bought the barista and it came with a defective pressure gauge did the test that breville provides to make sure it is not a coffee operator issue and it wa indeed a faulty gauge customer service at breville ha been a joke so now i am really not sure i want to buy another machine from them although i do like it anyone else ha any experience with them in that area,wow buy a breville barista express or pro then cheapen it with le quality material slap on some gimmick aka no tamp tamper steam wand valve and call it italian delonghi design i am sorry gail but that thing is trash look like someone at delonghi said copy the breville make it cheaper and slap our name on it cause we are jealous of breville is success,very bad explanation how to get coffe into the valve,hot cup d,six setting only for the grinder,thats limited setting,hello gale,that will be a no from me dog,750 usd for well basically a automatic machine that is disguised a not automatic and with pressurised basket no thanks,oh dear seriously,now it is clear who design brevile machine which are later put up together in china,but is it effortless though,it ha so many button just to run hot water in so many way so pointless this video is like something from some second rate shopping channel the guy would obviously like u to think delonghi have just invented this stuff how quick wa that extraction 2 second preinfusion 25 second extraction i would not want to pay that much money for that,the only good part is the tamper built in so le mess otherwise breville briasta series is definitely better and also delonghi is grinder just can not get fine enough i think that is why they just do pressurized basket only,proof reading would help you,i had a delonghi machine and it lasted 3 month opened it up to investigate and wa shocked at how terribly built it wa basically leaked out and rusted itself in only 3 month time now i know the difference and will be stepping up to a quality machine a gaggia and once that one go i will get a rotary pump expobar very disappointed with how terribly built the delonghi machine are they are just targeting the dumb best buy consumer that is cross shopping with breville which is also sorta crap none of what you are marketing is advanced all of it is crap your internals are crap your grinder is crap make quality and push the limit of the consumer market that is how you can beat breville this machine is dollar750 what the heck,weird had mine for over a year now and still just a good a the day i bought it me and my wife have 4 6 cup a day each a well,this is the machine one buy to replace it 6 month later with a real espresso setup,do not waste your money on this buy a cheap secondhand delonghi bean to cup for dollar200 the coffee will taste exactly the same then if you want a real espresso look at one of the 58mm machine from sage breville and many others,spot on,breville copycat,im sure they will have a non pressurised attachment soon,saw this at a store it feel very cheap nexto to a breville barista while being more expensive no thanks,bb also just look like espresso machine,sorry gail love ya but i just can not lol i have sampled this machine at a local distributor or should i say looked at it the moment the rep started giving me spec i laughed and literally said youre kidding me right lol they needed something to compete with the breville sage in this range tried to reinvent the wheel with button and bow but gave nothing but a flat tire haha in all honesty i wa actually hesitant to even touch it a lot of cheep plastic and flimsy feel wont even mention how the grinder felt making adjustment oh and that rinse button why lol my list can go on and on buy you all seem to feel the same there is a market for it however those that have no clue but want to say doe not it look good on my counter,what is your recommendation please for the best machine to get a close to cafe quality,i think the dedica deluxe is the best model delonghi ha to offer overall after a bit of mod,w i am aware of everything you said and i agree with it my suggestion to the op still stand buy a breville it is an extremely simple solution to his problem,dbauernf you are missing the point this is clearly an effort to copy a breville i worked many year a an engineer designer and product manager the first rule of modeling another product especially one that is super well designed is that you must have strong selling point you either design it to sell cheaper or you improve the weakness of the competitor design but most important of u that you do not create or add more weakness in this case it is priced around breville it doesnt seem to solve any real problem a tampering arm and panarello wand is about the only differentiator i see here they obviously spent money on engineering that tampering arm and somehow calling it smart what is so smart about it no where do i see any information about the smartness other than it is integrated the paranello wand appears to be similar design on other delonghi is product and since it ha only two setting position you are can not adjust the aeration amount and these design do not usually generate velvety microfoam breville left it simple so user can have full control of the wand and generate perfect foam i saw one and used it in person and it is a bad what most people are saying just a poorly executed copycat,i own various coffee machine from different brand and after all these machine later i am convinced breville designer and engineer are far more superior to delonghi is almost everything delonghi put out ha flaw whereas breville product are just incredibly well thought out and perfectly executed,damn got so excited but then it hit me grinder suck portafilter suck pressurized basket and that steaming wand oh cmon i thought that there s gon na be another player by the side of breville but nooopeee,classical machine it must be cheap,what a waste it only come with pressurized basket at least breville let you use non pressurized one on their cheaper machine,basket is least flaw one one easily get them replaced with non pressurized what to do with light alloy portafilter and grouphead,de longhi la specialista is generating a ton of review due to leaking and leaving puddle under the machine and on to the floor this wa my choice and love it but those review have stalled my decision considering the price and how new it is that make me nervous,so this is a crappy full auto machine that you just need to manually change the portafilter from one spout to the other just buy a better full auto machine for that money,rasmus dyhr frederiksen no it is not the same concept it is a completely different concept it is a completely worse concept,exactly the same concept a breville which is much much more expensive but i agree stupid concept,enjoying watching your video this one like a show but the machine it is not worth it however they are plenty of people that doe not understand enough and will buy it anyway thanks for sharing,oh my i wa turned off when i saw that it wa pressurized only,not very impressive for that price,oh yeah having a badge on the front that say la italian name would be a great idea we will definitely sell more now the guy wa saying a coarser grind mean weaker coffee they are using the same amount of coffee in the basket so it is not weaker just under extracted and sour,just letting you know that your comment completely go against what wa said at 6 55 a you adjust the coarseness the grinder will adjust the grinder time so you are grinding more or le coffee so the dose remains consistent each time i have no idea how you managed to misunderstand that,i would not give a dime for a worthless pressurized system what is the point it ai not espresso false advertising also no professional frothing wand lmao no thanks sticking to my modded dedica,very bad try to copy breville with lot of basic feature in a shiny package price should be no more than dollar299,ajdin zolota no delonghi doe not make breville machine,i agree first of all no unpressurized filter,they make breville machine,delonghi and breville are not the same or same family company,that is what i thought,look like breville but not a good a a breville,i think this is a copycat of breville but fails in just about every area it is priced between two of the brevilles and try to improve some area that doe not need to be improved but took away the flexibility of the breville,event 42 a machine that cost over dollar700 should include unpressurized basket,1 eq 0 dot 99999 repeating basket is big concern for coffe enthusiast but so small cost to machine producer why not add one non pressurised with machin,z one can buy proper basket for delonghi machine i had ec145 which came with non pressurized basket basket is not biggest concern with this kind of coffee appliance though,that wa my thought the lack of un pressurised basket would certainly put me off if i wa looking for a replacement for my sage barrista express,could have been a great machine if it had the standard head with non pressurized basket,the grinder is way off the machine is a waste of money if you want real espresso the review wa not the best,could have been a great machine if it is priced around dollar299,the grinder is probably not up to the task,wow fantastic design look great oh yeah you just copied the barista express from breville sage,you can not see the tamper on this machine and i think it is not copied it is just inspirated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,how many cup we can make per day with this machine,it is for home use so not really more than 10 15 a day,doe the coffee hopper need to be filled with bean for the grinder to work i can not get the grinder to work when i install the filter,yes it doe to avoid damaging the grinder,yes do not use without grinder full,let is see what happens there we go an espresso imagine that,will this work with the starbucks black coffee bean sold at costco i am trying to get one for my wife and that is the coffee she us,koi aquaponics starbucks ha many different roast but most of them are dark and oily if that is the case they cause problem in grinder the oil and this will happen on any machine suggest you have your wife try a different bean even from starbucks although we think she can find better,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear are there machine made for those type of bean,would not recommend using those they are oily and will hurt the grinder,how would i ensure that the pressure is at optimum,,i followed your instruction but the espresso is still really watery is it the bean the grind setting the sugar doe not float at the top of my espresso but sink any suggestion would be greatly appreciated,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you for the prompt reply so what coffee density do you recommend or brand i have lavazza 8 10 intensity i will start with the bean and try it out also the grind should be at the fine mark correct,likely a combination we have a new video coming out soon where we purposely make a bad espresso and then adjust grind etc to fix it every bea had a different density and roast level which affect the weight and brewing so each must be dialed on look for our specialista arte video soon,it is both actually and likely,warning do not buy the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville them pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,wipe your wand and you are off to go,purchased one yesterday still getting use to it but one issue im finding is the group head a real issue to insert at time once full of coffee,it need to be tight for the pressure to work it will get easier or get some food grade lubrican not to help,we just bought this so far good but i would like my coffee a little bit more hot any suggestion a how to get it a little bit more hotter,prewarm your cup with hot water that is about the best bet are you making americano,i bought de longhi la specialista and within few month it stopped working and their support center is not much of a help either and now i have expensive machine sitting on my kitchen counter a a deco think twice before you buy this machine,it should have a warranty not sure which country you are in but usually they are good just keep trying,i noticed the water softener filter wa not included when i purchased this machine is it ok to operate the machine without it thanks for sharing,it is just do not use hard water or well water tap is best depending on where you live,is the tamping lever metal,plastic,old model please rereview with last much improved model,we did one better,what is the meaning of my bottom actually what that bottom did,hi please let me know if filter are pressurized double bottom or not what is diameter of portafilter is grinder really good esoresso flow too fast on presentation,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear ok i will,this machine is now discontinued look at the newer version prestigio and maestro,i am a barista and i am leaving my work soon and i do not think i can live without coffee made by me so i bought this one and i hope it is good,can you purchase additional lattecrema attachment or how would you seamlessly go between different milk option,they do not work on the original laspecialista,garbage breville better,i do not understand how can this video be two year old being that today wa the release of this machine by delongai according to the email i got,they released newer version in the last month or two there wa the original la specialista now there is the prestigio and the maestro,thank you spent 20m trying to use it by myself and had no idea what i wa doing but now i have a coffee so thanks,you are welcome,milk come first in cappucinos,an age old debate,are not the basket pressurized an important factor for many,they are but we will have non pressurized soon for this model,just bought this for my wife but in red,is it suitable for commercial use around 100cup per day,nope this is for home use,my husband just bought this for me yesterday i love it just now need to perfect frothing the milk and my coffee will be perfect,i wonder how you could do that hmmm why do all pro coffee machine use the same style wand nah that can not be it,enjoy,nice review thanks,can i use for a mini coffe shop,would not recommend these are home unit,great presentation i wa wondering if this brand make extra hot coffee how hot can this machine make coffee i normally have my coffee at 95 degree hot thank you,on a home unit that is a hard temp to reach even commercial challenge at time you can get close with americano a the water is coming out at a higher temp i do recommend you go to a store that ha a demo and try it though first,do you recomend this for a small coffee store,no not made for commercial use,the video wa very interesting i enjoy espresso every day with delonghi is magnifica s i also subscribed to the channel please come visit me on my channel with love from japan,hi i bought this machine and i am having trouble with the tamper it doe not seem to compact the coffee overly well and making my coffee very watery what am i doing wrong,probably need to adjust your grind setting,i am sold that would be good addition on my yacht when i am sailing around the world seabucks i can make money i have a woodfired pizza oven and i sold a 16 inch margarita pizza for dollar35,how are you meant to dial in your coffee bean,you do not bother it only come with double wall filter basket in order to be used with any pre ground coffee bean on the market this machine wa designed to be a basic a possible with a big comprimise on quality this ha nothing on the breville barista express not even close,my husband bought for me a a birthday gift i love it,my wife bought for me a well for my birthday arrived today,this is a piece of shit do not buy it,i will make video to show that the machine is a piece of shit and i do not recommend to buy it at all,this machine is very bad and the pressure gage can be full of water and you can not use it anymore in addition delongi is the worst company to deal with,more of an advertorial than a review if you ask me that is a lot of money for a thermoblock espresso machine that doe a lot of stuff but none really good gaggia classic is a way better deal or even the breville bambino plus for a couple of dollar le and with the change you cand buy a decent entry level grinder,i just bought this machine and having tough time achieving the optimal zone finest on number 1 and grinding it a few time while adjusting the dial the coffee level on recommended level and above also can not achieve the optimal zone,really,u need to rotate the milk when foaming even with this type of wound u will get better result,so happy that i did not buy this garbage only good looking plastic and too expensive take a barista pro 878 and you get something useful,on your comment about oily bean is it true that arabica tends to be quite a bit more oily than robusta i also heard that a a result of that you can get a finer and longer lasting crema on robusta coffee due to the reason that it is le oily and more co2 rich than arabica,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you so much i really appreciate your help,tomasz pasternak it is nice and easy to use probably the best tech we have seen at that price point,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear that is awesome because i have already been looking at both thank you is the auto milk function actually good and consistent on the touch if not i am willing to get the pro and learn to do it by hand thanks again,tomasz pasternak honestly i believe breville win for ease of use in that price range look at the touch and pro,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear interesting i will do more reading on that would you recommend your top 3 semi auto machine under 1500 cad thanks,can you pull a espresso shot and froth milk at the same time,you can not do both at the same time but you can do them back to back without wait time,dude if you like push button and get coffee get your self nespresso it is amazing no hassel,hi chef thank you for your comment nespresso machine can be the way to go if you are looking for no hassle but often time end up being very costly in the long term with the purchasing of coffee pod these machine are geared more towards those looking to have the barista experience with their machine at home,i would cry with gratitude,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear i can not thank god enough for my beautiful friend i have not celebrated last christmas yet i am praying for miracle today i will absolutely cry for year,it is a great item to add onto your christmas wishlist keep an eye out for our upcoming promotion,peut on faire caf latte,oui vous pouvez absolument,,55555,5 555555,nice video fun and informative thank you,can i foam milk while using the brewing station not sure if it is a dual boiler,it is not a dual boiler technically you have to do it separately the wording is that the heating system is independent,i keep getting the cloud icon error and it will not allow me to grind the coffee can someone help,glad the milk container wa over filled got a good look at the foam,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,that is too bad ibrahim i hope delonghi help you out with your issue note to reader ibrahim did not purchase this in canada through our company a we would help all of our customer out and are an authorized warranty centre for delonghi in canada,excellent review i have just bought this incredible machine i have one question how do i know if the coffee bean are oily or not is there a special kind of toast or something to know i am buying the correct not oily bean thanks a lot,jos luis c rdova p rez those bean should be great thank you,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thanks for the first use of the machine i chose illy classic roasted coffee bean is that ok again i would like to say that you have great content in your channel congratulation,avoid starbucks and bean roasted a french roast usually espresso roast is good but really it just mean looking at the bean and looking for a shine on them if they appear wet they are oily,we have had three of these machine all have leaked eventually got our money back amp bought a breville sage,john yao no idea they just flooded the kitchen worktop,where wa the leak from,bought one three month ago still working well with daily use the programmable button is perfect for me and my wife since we have different taste in coffee i like mine really strong and she like hers a bit watery it really depends on the quality of the bean how coarse or fine you want the grind and the amount this machine is really comparable to an entry level dslr if we are talking about camera most function are automated but you have manual option if you are really into it,allen l mine is 12 month old and still working fine,3 month ago and still working well with daily use i would hope it still work after 3 year of daily use,thanks for sharing,lol for a moment i thought you were doing the review in a random shop that just happened to have that machine sitting around d,i hope from your channel it is working video how to adjust the coffee and adjust the strength of the bar and how to set the mill to get out pavel espresso coffee cup,great suggestion,hello i bought this machine but it doe not adjust the coffee for me every time i am having difficulty tuning it my brother ha a sage pro which is better than delaunki in term of extracting coffee,check out our video on getting to the optimal zone the big thing will be grind channeling of coffee and amount used at the end of the day brew what you like and do not get too worried about meeting criterion what matter is your taste satisfaction most,why you have not tried coffee button,great review,i like some of the idea put into this machine but sadly i feel at this price point it fall flat compared to breville smart tamp station is great but pressurized portafilters and a panerello steam wand come on,i agree pressurized portafilter make fake crema the panerello wand is garbage tamp station is very gimmicky too this machine will not last more than a year of everyday use,hello i need an advice i am not a specialist but like a lot a good coffee can espresso from this machine be good a from professional one in the coffee shop i love everything about it but there is not a place where i could try coffee from it i used to drink a lot of coffee in italy my husband is italian and asked me to buy a coffee machine can it fit my expectation,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you i just saw a review of gaggia and espresso look way better it is not watery but creamy how i like i definitely will consider this machine i am not to much into design but quality of coffee it is that what matter thank you guy,todd is accurate and we agree look at the gaggia new classic a well a the breville line in the same price range they all take a bit of work and play but you can get a nice product with some trial and error just the way you like it if you are in ontario we have two store and you can come by and try in our store,todd soden any recommendation for non pressurized portafilters coffee machine for home usage i know i need to learn a lot before,joanna if you want cafe style result you need a machine with non pressurized portafilters and a traditional steam wand and learn technique on how to make a great drink this machine is for people who want to start into their espresso journey and it doe make thing quite easy but it take shortcut in area that would otherwise make it an amazing machine it is not a terrible machine but imo there are simply better machine out there for the same price i have also heard from many that delonghi after sale service is not so good if ec handle all warranty issue then no problem,with the amount you would pay you can get something way way better,sergei hanush those example doe not stop at that point you can pay a little more and almost get to the high end of coffee machine like the rocket giotto or mozzafiatto with a vibratory pump profitec 500 or 700 expobar machine ecm machine paired with a pid system for the best experience,sergei hanush plus that the steaming stick is not professional and not acceptable at this price tag it will not steam properly,sergei hanush if you want it with a grinder the barista pro from sage breville also oscar ii from nouve simonelli a great machine the con i see with this delonghi the portfilter basket is smaller than standard whitch is 58mm it come with pressurized basket the basket size of the delonghi is either 51 or 54 i can not remeber exactly which can not or hard to hold 18g of grounded coffee,show example for the price it cost it is a good product all good automatic machine 1 5k in cost,what i think would ruin this machine for me is i like doing the milk myself a a barista that is the funnest part i do not want it to be manual at all,lake bawson is having a stronk,what,i am looking at buying a machine it is out of the la specialista or breville barista express ha anyone got any advice on what machine would be best i should also note that i have zero knowledge of coffee and am coming from instant thankyou,thank you for your reply and input,either the barista express or the specialista the barista express is a bit messier but they both will give you great espresso with some practice,help so i have added bean in grinder but the no bean glowing icon keep flashing what do i do,you have to re set up the grinder and click it without the click will not work,make sure you hear a click when you first attach the grinder i had the same issue when attaching mine on simple fix seriously should mention it in a video or something it just mean the grinder is not attached properly,return it to the store and buy a breville in all seriousness though sound like the grinder already broke,could be a warranty issue try emptying out with the power off and start again,i bet you have all the label of your caned food all facing the same way in the cupboard,are these filter single or duel wall thanks,neil madden thanks,duel,ok ok i need to finally comment on one of these video doe delonghi have some dirty laundry on all the reviewer on youtube there is not a single negative video not one a a coffee roaster and barista for close to 15 year this machine incorporates literally the worst feature you could want in a machine pressurized basket portafilter not 58mm built in grinder dosing and tamping pannarello steam wand and the list go on the grind straight out of the machine look mile to course and if it wa not for the pressurized basket those shot would look a bad a they would of actually tasted why is everyone on youtube singing praise for this po,keep in mind not everyone is a barista of 15 year and doe not have the interest or time to master a machine while not for everyone it doe fit a need in the market for a beginner that want to start experimenting with espresso and is competing with the breville barista express they all have flaw in this price point with all they fit in you can buy a ferrari it you can buy a dodge they both drive but one is harder to drive and may be a better vehicle many simply can not afford a ferrari and frankly do not need it hope this help make sense for you,question when you do an espresso or a capuchino at 2x would you get twice the size of drink or twice the strength i feel my double espresso are very small the americano size is good thx,you get double the volume of espresso same strength in each theoretically,hey ec i am so confused about what to buy for our first beginner espresso machine want to make mostly espresso and the occassional americano we love the look of this and we like the built in grinder but i have heard bad thing about the crema on this machine we are also considering the barista express and gaggia classic any suggestion,sd1991 gaggia then,express is great and highly recommend a a beginner machine look great too gaggia too a it is italian you need to surf the water on the gaggia for milk but once you get used to it the machine will last forever still the barista express is a solid machine that outsells everything the overall favourite amongst our staff in that price point,i should say longevity is a consideration and we are not coffee snob or connoisseur,,same machine but when i make long black hot water coming first,i bought the 656 85 m first then the la specialista obviously i prefer the la specialista more,i wonder with all the bell amp whistle if this machine which look great is really any better than delonghi is compact machine the result seems similar and if one add is dedica is matching grinder which ha it seems much finer espresso setting than la specialista you have the equivalent for half the price,nice demo the 3 year warranty is nice i have used the barista express every day for the last few year with not one problem a real workhorse if this delonghi wa available i might have bought one instead it is a few hundred dollar more i believe both look similar with many of the same function i like the tamper on this the more manual version on the be can be a bit messy i will give this a try if my barista express ever break down,why change for an inferior machine poor grinder setting and no single wall basket result inferior espresso,thanks for the review this wa one of the factor a to why i bought this machine,you mention not to use oily coffee bean can you please give me example of which one to use and which one not to use or how do i know the difference sorry but i am just begging god my journey into the espresso world thank you in advance,defidino not at oil oily is not bad or old just not great in grinder because of the oil,ok so the darker the roast the oily the coffee bean could be and is that a sign of bad old coffee bean,sure thing it is easy just look at the bean if they are shiny and wet looking then they are oily usually french roast but also some espresso roast non oily will be obvious when you see them compared,i have a few concern about this machine first at this price point why would they use such a small portafilter and second why only use pressurize basket i have seen other machine at this price point and they give you the option of pressurized and non pressurized basket,bill smith pressurised basket is the biggest failing of this machine it is basically fake coffee,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear what i would like to know is if an average double shot of espresso contains approx 18 gram of coffee to produce a 2 oz shot how can this machine produce a double shot with only 13 gram of coffee and still taste the same a a double shot with 18 gram of coffee,yes definitely we found the quality of the ninja sub par in comparison,we agree they are suggesting this for beginner but hopefully that will be improved with new feature and a single wall in the future,just bought this machine 600 00 at bed bath and beyond the no mess tamping no mess coffee grinding and no ground all over the counter top wa the biggest selling point for me the grinder work ok i would like to see a smaller grind to raise the extraction pressure many shot do not reach the optimum level while pulling shot but still make a good coffee the spent puck are solid and consistent and dry not watery but overall it a good clean self contained machine and make good coffee at the same flavor a peet is and starbucks if you know what your doing and if you use the 2 cup filter and for le than 20 cent per cup but once it again it make a good b grade coffee 90percent fully automatic and leaf no mess on your counter top or you hand you never have to touch the coffee once it put into the grinder,m navlar not having to ever touch the coffee is worth the extra cost of not having to grind it then pour it into the porta filter and have ground all over my counter top then have to tamp it and again ground over the counter top however it doe make good coffee and i am satisfied with it if there wa a better one on the market that did all those thing i would have gladly paid 1000 00 buck for it i get a 4 00 petes coffee for 20 cent every time,this machine is a rip off for what you get,how can you dial in a machine that only doe pressurised coffee it is a gimmick i will not have the same extraction a a extraction basket just pressurised air the sage barista is a better option imo,m navlar the machine come with with 2 different size of porta filter one shot and two shot the machine ha a setting on the panel thatlooks like this 2x you press it once if you want a double grind and double amount of coffee to go into the larger porta filter the dial on the left also meter the amount of coffee being dropped into the filter at the same time however the machine default to single shot and you need to tell it if you want single or double shot the size of filter and amount of coffee to be ground to fit the correct size of which ever filter you use it a very good machine and make very good coffee very trouble free and doesnt make a mess and i do not have to mess with coffee ground all over the counter top i use it everyday and make good coffee it also ha hot water on demand just press a button and hot water will pours out,how do you dial in your coffee for a 18 g in to 36g our in 27 33 second,yo tengo la de longhi magnifica desde hace unos a o y estoy muy contenta me est dando muy buenos resultados,great video thanks,hi i just purchased this machine 2 day ago i have try different grinding level and dossis amount but for some reason i can not get to the optimal zone would you please be so kind and provide some advice in order to do so i am dying to start making some great espresso,put on finest setting and get at or just above the line,watch this video on the subject,we have one of these and the americano is called long black on ours,what did he mean by box store,store like costco,doe it have any plastic part internally where hot water or coffee is heated or where it dispensed or anywhere where plastic get in touch with hot water,there are rubber ring inside where the coffee sits in the portafilter not sure why,there will be some internal part that are plastic to avoid this look for machine made in europe,hi thank you for the review i need help please to choose between breville or this machine which one do you recommend can i get the same quality in both mechanic,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear,ovwrall similar result most of our team have more experience with the breville so it tends to be preferred but you would be happy with either,i bought this unit today at your burlington store due to this video review the comparison video with the breville and the incredible employee who helped u test the unit she wa incredibly helpful and super friendly still coming down from caffeine overload from getting this machine all setup,thanks for your trust in u,ive sampled it a lot of button and bow but that is it the main package is weak go with the breville way better quality,lovelivinglife thanks again these grinder are almost a much a the machine any idea which grinder is best bang for buck i will try to make this my last question lol thanks for the help,ralph kramden you can not go wrong with either of those for that price range been around for year and proven for me i would go with the silvia simply for aesthetic lol only reason i chose the barista express is i own several breville item and always good but moreso wa with the grinder wa only dollar100 more than without for me i mostly do american cap latte machiattos etc i already have a good grinder when i really want to dial in for just esspresso shot,lovelivinglife thanks for that considering the gaggia or rancilo silva and sette 30 grinder any suggestion opinion thanks,a lot of cheap plastic the steam arm is cheap plastic with one thin sleeve of stainless cover which you basically have no control over a far a fine tweaking your steam the grinder ha minimal setting they only give you pressurized basket the self tamping lever is huge but fee cheap a well a the porta filter is fully enclosed in the grind tamp station you can not see the amount nor quality of your grind all in all the machine feel flimsy to the touch even in the video he say it give it somewhat of a commercial look and that is all it is a look not performance a far a the three setting for espresso americano etc the water run directly through the porta filter for the americano which anyone that know all that doe is create a nasty overextraction by running the water continuously through the ground basically this machine wa designed for those hey look at me look what i have people instead of look what my machine can actually do,weak in what area,do you know how many gram of coffee it us for a double shot,15 20 g,i just bought this machine after my 6year old breville barista broke pull a good shot the only issue i have is the milk steamer you can not control the steam it is either all the way on full force or off and then turn off after 60 second the steamer ha a foam setting on it but it doe not create a lot of foam the breville you could control the steam flow to get good foam i could about triple the amount foam from the milk in the cup the delonghi doe not generate a lot of micro foam any idea on how to get better foam with this machine i really do not want to return it because of the foam issue appreciate any guidance,sorry for the delayed reply but we have got some solution so first trick you could try is to remove the metal casing for the steam wand and just use the rubber tip from inside it just pull off and can be easily put back on you will not be breaking the machine second trick you could try once you are done steaming the milk cover your milk cup with your hand swirl it around and bang it on the counter a few time this should release some of the larger bubble and create that micro foam aesthetic,pressure is way too low is that intentional for your particular blend,sorry we missed this comment pressure wa lower on filming this segment than we would have liked we did a second video on optimum zone here a it is a bit more tricky with this machine to get there,which brand machine is best for self repairability in this price range dollar500 800,thanks,unfortunately there is not one in that price range you are dealing with mostly made in china check out gaggia new classic but it is a bit more,crap i am sold on it,question with this being a 51mm filter will a different delonghi unpressurized filter fit,genesis hi did you find a non pressurised filter basket did it improve the quality,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you i am very curious about this i know it is been done with other delonghi machine so i am very hopeful the ability to use an unpressurized filter would in my opinion make this machine a very tough bargain to beat i guess i need to take the plunge and begin experimenting,so we tested it to try to get an answer delonghi ha different sized filter which use a couple different method to hold them in so long a it is a standard delonghi 51mm filter it should fit,i owned a delonghi la specialista machine for a week already but i can not seems to bring the pressure up to optimal zone is there any problem with the machine or any adjustment i need to make for the pressure gauge to go up to optimal zone,thanks i will check out the video,have a look at this video,awesome job thank you,bella maccina forza italia,great video can you do a comparison with the breville barista pro,great idea we will add that to our video roster,is the portafilter pressurized or non pressurized also grinder seems not fine enough for non pressurize even though the tamping system is awesome and also is the dosing by volume or time,atlgatorupdate i received an oem replacement basket from an amazon seller in the end i chose to alter an original basket rather than worry about whether a different brand basket would fit the portafilter the alteration wa done simply by cutting the base off the basket with my dremel tool note if you decide to do this yourself be sure to leave enough of a lip that the removable plate at the base of the basket can not not fit through not rocket science but you need to have some common sense to do this in my case i wa happy just having an unpressurized basket i did not worry about the plastic routing disc inside the portafilter which is removable if i decided to remove that i would simply need to purchase a second portafilter to continue to easily use the pressurized basket result the system work perfectly with an unpressurized basket i still use the pressurized basket 90percent of the time a my morning are busy and i do not have the time to play around with dialing in the perfect dose which leaf my weekend to enjoy the process a bit more from the get go i have had the system set up to grind and brew shot that are so very close to what i consider to be my perfect shot that i do not feel there is enough of a difference to need to do this i do it only when i feel like being more involved in the creative process,atlgator exactly bit of a joke really,son lam nguyen update actually this wa a mistake the 13gram wa set to single dose i did not notice someone had turned off double dose when i measured i will measure again and post then former post i apologize i completely forgot to respond here i measured out a 2x grind from the auto sensor and received 13 gram that is my personal setting but there is still room to increase grind on the machine i am sure 17 gram would be no issue,son lam nguyen sorry it is taken awhile to get back to you i need to empty a basket onto my scale and do a proper measure before i reply i have just been using the dose provided by the auto sensor i am being very lazy i know in the morning i just want my shot lol i will do it tonight and will reply again,genesis how many geams of coffee can you use in at 51mm i have a breville 54mm and use at 17mm for a double,i brought this coffee machine about 3 week ago and really liked it one thing i noticed in your demonstration is that you were using the temper handle handle too many time delonghi in their manual book on how to use it say you only use it once but i guess it is up to everyone is individual like,is the temper handle made out of plastic or steel doe it feel sturdy and durable,yep just an arbitrary number the little ocd in me,my husband and i bought this machine about 3 month ago and we love it,i just bought this machine and having tough time achieving the optimal zone finest on number 1 and grinding it a few time while adjusting the dial the coffee level on recommended level and above also can not achieve the optimal zone,noproblem2big still going strong and still loving it best choice a far a i am concerned,i pick this one instead of breville because it ha a lower wattage 1850 v 1450 is it a bad choice,0709adri i wanted to know how this machine wa still going reliability wise but decided to buy the breville instead,noproblem2big tell me please what do you mean,a decaf requires more pressure when tamping is it still able to apply enough pressure to get a quality tasting decaf coffee,what is better the breville pro or this machine,considering it ha pressurised basket only tamping is not critical at all it will brew anything,we did not have any issue with tamp pressure once we got the grind and quantity figured out so you should be good,nice review can it adjust the temperature of the milk i like my coffee very hot can this machine do really hot coffee,it can burn your milk,hey winnie that is actually an interesting question that we have never thought about because the milk is heated by the steam the longer you leave it in the hotter it will get so really it is up to you how hot you want it the machine will automatically turn off the steam after a certain time though so in order to get hotter milk than that you would just have to restart the steaming on the same milk we would not totally recommend that a at high temperature milk will start to break down however it will certainly get it hotter,is it too hard to adjust the machine to have the pressure in the optimal zone range more 13 minute video but can not see the machine doing it is best,posting another video soon with some trick,not too hard realized that in editing we didnt show the gauge hitting that spot it did take u a few adjustment to grind and amount to get there but we did found it easier on the barista express to be honest though,nice looking machine it is like the breville barista with some cool feature,very similar in look and feel,,,,,,,,,,
4,doe the pressure gauge change depending on the temp setting i used 2 bar for medium a suggested and never got to optimal,i like,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,thank you for the review i bought mine two month ago and i absolutely love it,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear keep up the great work you are doing i am following you from the uk now i am trying to make the best espresso still working,great to hear,where did you get the under machine double knock drawer from,that is the rancilio base if you are in canada you can get it on our website here it is currently out of stock but i believe we have ordered more from the supplier and you can sign up to be notified when it is back in stock,hey just wondering would you get better another microfoam with a single hole steam wand i am a barista and can not seem to get the hang of the wand with this machine,i just bought this and the pressure guage doe not move much why,grind setting could be too coarse or too fine,i own this machine and recently bought a pressurized filter so i can grind my decaf bean in another grinder without having to swich the bean in the machine grinder every time so my question is if the preground coffee dose and tamp are not perfect the pressure gauge will not be in the optimal zone but will the pressurized filter make up for it so i do not have to worry about getting the gauge in the optimal zone when using it,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear i have tried it and yes it work well even with the gauge under the optimal zone i had to try twice though the 1st time i did the same procedure i usually do with the non pressurized filter and it did not come out super nicely with the pressurized filter the 2nd time i used a separate coffee grinder and did the same thing i used to do with my previous machine which only had a non pressurized filter adding an approximate quantity of coffee that seemed fine and hand tamping it turned out great,it should make up for it at the end of the day if the product coming out is acceptable to you do not worry too much about the gauge,i love the video not sure if it is the machine that caught my attention or the lecturer,just curious do the steam wand and single wall filter basket retro fit to the la specialista i would love to at least be able to switch out the steam wand for the wand on the prestigio,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you for the quick reply that is disappointing considering g the machine are virtually udentical huge expense since my la specialista is just over a year old ugh oh well thank you again,wand no but basket yes,wow any professional barista would be able to tell how terrible this demonstration is not you a a demonstrator but the machine itself the steamer is definitely weak and the sound of you steaming the milk reminds me of my first day on my coffee making class,hahahahahah my kind of humor xd double wanded cup gt let leave it up there to keep it warm seriously xddd,can you make a decaf with another deposit,you can always use pre ground espresso and tamp it without using the grinder,what is different of 9335 and 9355,9335 is the original and no longer made,look like you make very nice and easy creamy espresso and pressure wa high too could you please open secret what coffee used thanks,we used an arabica espresso medium roast that we roast in house 88mph one point twenty one coffee,you do not tell u what the pressure actually is it just read optimal zone or what the temperature of the three setting end up being and you do not drink the coffee it make to see if it is actually any good that seems pretty weird honestly not sure what you are really reviewing here,hello alex by my experience temperature is between 92 and 96 degree with correct level spent some time to adjust coffee after press in optimal zone it is really nice cream on top no mess all taste is very subjective of course in home i do drawing on latte it miracle love this machine have a nice day,i love the machine made a spro that tasted like i put 3 sugar and honey in it bought my bean from ec too reliable just wondering if anyone know if a bottomless portafilter is available somewhere,what material are all the button handle tamper dropdown tray etc are those plastic or stainless steel,combination of both tray is stainless handle plastic,excellent presentation thank you,thank you,thank you for a great presentation it is informative i have bought one and loved it especially the tamping mechanism,is there a possibility of upgrading the steaming wand of the original la specialista with this traditional wand,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you for the reply i wa hoping it had the same connection and it wa a straight swap,no it is not,having real difficulty getting that milk rolling with that wand not sure if it is the lack of mobility on the steam wand or the inconsistent pulsating strength of it,it best if you settle down to get the milk to roll,likely mobility,so i am not sure if anyone know this but is it possible to change the steam wand from la specialista to the wand on this one,it is not unfortunately,thank you for that review is it non pressurized i read a lot of previous complaint about only being a pressurized one,are you referring to the tamper,pink potato slime thanks god right sometimes yt can just make you more stressed,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you so so much for responding i wa thinking of returning it but i think i will keep it it should arrive soon,new one is non pressurized nice upgrade v original,thank you for the video what is the heat up time,about 30 second,great video,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,barista express la specialista affiliate link,they are not the type of company who really directly support creator partner i have not been able to get so much a a demo unit from them so not only wa i not gaining anything from the relationship but i wa actually losing something due to possibly seeming biased in my review,why did you end your relationship with breville,i love my barista express this video make me like it even more,i purchased the brevelle 18months ago and it lost it pressure wont get up to the correct pressure to make a coffee out of warranty by 6 month and pissed off to say the least never purchasing a brevelle coffee machine again,so awkward to watch headless body move,then you would love my new video,great detailed comparison of the system material built quality etc v only comparing style,i have the same delonghi machine and i have to say this this machine is not good for lattee art it doe not provide microfaom like brevil dose,delonghi is simply taking the price point p s,i have the breville barista express and i hate it for so many reason i premise that i worked a barista in italy for a decade the biggest issue here are will never reach the correct minimum brewing temperature in order to properly extract coffee i had three machine sent by breville and they were all the same the brewing and the grinder are very unstable and unreliable you are gon na waste so much coffee to test each new coffee bag you buy and set the machine with proper grind etc and then the next day you are gon na get a completely different coffee and have to reset the grinder and waste more coffee bean you will never be able to extract real espresso which is creamy hot thick and taste good with breville it is always bitter or sour or watery and missing crema or whatnot you are gon na end up wasting your time for hour and wasting a lot of expensive coffe to never find the right extraction and end up using the double walled filter basket to at least have a decent coffee forget about using the professional single walled basket they only deceive you that you have the option but the machine is not capable of using it be aware breville machine are good for those who do not know the difference between an italian espresso and a starbucks espresso,is it just me or is it weird that we can not see his head,lifestyle lab lol,good thing i have since found it,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville them pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,is barista express a good option for opening a cafe,no not at all these are not commercial machine,just bought laspecialista and did not work and returned then i read about the build quality and is so bad bought breville instead,the new 2021 machine portafilter is same like breville there is no single hole yes the dia is still smaller than breville,yes we have an whole separate video on the prestigio,tell u your opinion about the beem espresso grind profession i believe is the evolution of the breville barista express 870,thank you so much for this saved me from buying the wrong machine,do not what you mean i bought the delonghi and the built quality is amazing and you talk about cheap plastiv but the outside of the breville look cheap when compared to the delonghi this is such a biased review,both are metal body build quality on the delonghi is not amazing sorry the grind adjustment the portafilter basket all the fake plastic chrome build quality is difficult to quantify but i am comparing these to the other 12 espresso machine i have owned at a variety of price point and from a variety of brand difference of opinion doe not constitute bias,wa just about to buy the delonghi but wanted to make sure it wold be a good choice thank you for this,i would like to see your opinion on the other delonghi machine mine look that that but no automatic tamp weird wand attachment and the port filter is not pressurised,i just did a comparison with the delonghi dedica,not receiving compensation sure the delongui is that bad or you did not bother set that correctly sorry but your video seems totally biased,pretty sure i know how to dial in espresso not to mention i always use the same espresso for all machine grinder review,the tamp on the breville is dreadful and doe not fit the basket properly about a 4mm gap the steam function on both machine is inferior to the sage bambino plus which will make perfect latte milk without any input from the user for the price they both should be better,super til tu esplicaci n,interesting video but i just bought a la specialista and the portafilter definitely is a real one with many hole not just a single hole like you claim it is a brilliant machine really clean with the built in tamper,oh yes you are right thank goodness i did,you likely bought the la specialista prestigio which i have a separate video on,thanks for taking the time to make this comparative review saved me some possible heartache and regret,love your video i wa considering upgrading my breville barista express to this one but no way now i love my breville old school but extract best shot,thank you so much for the technical breakdown and the thought behind the build quality,are you australian if you are you may be bias lol but i believe la specialista is over priced for what it doe not do,,great comparison thank you helped me decide,you saved me from buying the wrong machine for my preference thank you love how you did the side by side detailed to the point description,which one did you get,excellent,hola que tal me podr a dar tu opini n o hacer una comparativa entre este mismo modelo de breville pero ahora contra la specialista maestra la specialista maestra v breville barista express bes870xl,amazing top notch review comparison the fact that delonghi charge 900 buck for a pressurized espresso maker is incredible how can they go so low they really went all in for the look and design but zero in term of build quality and what you get espresso wise delonghi is advertising like the new vid with brad pitt and overall cheap machine really make me question their brand overall have had 2 bean to cup from them since my dad us those but they both had issue after 2 year after the warranty expired so that is that thanks for this great video definitely siding with sage breville on this one and will probably get it,i just got mine for 89 the la specialista brand new,you can easily find the de longhi for dollar600 00 a few time a year and the warranty is actually 3 year you just need to register it online for the additional year,garbage breville much much better,someone reviewing coffee machine that actually seems to understand coffee can not believe it,paid by breville,nope,i just got the latest version of the delonghi arte seems they have made a huge amount of improvement,what this review forgot to mention is that in a domestic use the de longhi machine offer a 2 year warranty whilst the breville is only 1 year my breville required dollar611 worth of repair after just under 2 year old and for that price i wa able to buy a brand new de longhi machine,most credit card double warranty,isaac newton good to know thanks,3 year with de longhi when you register online,can not find it on amazon maybe somewhere else it is possible to buy it,yes sage and breville are the same brand for different market,lifestyle lab can find just sage it look the same,lifestyle lab europe,what country are you shopping from,you saved me a couple of hundred dollar thanks,bonjour nous avon une specialista et nous somme vraiment tr s d u car tr s peu de mousse sur cette machine,what about la specialista prestigio,same issue with the grinder and built quality,wish i ave found this video before buying the la specialista at 1st you enjoy the coffee but with time you start to learn and perfect your coffee making skill and you come to the realization that the la specialista is limiting you and is in a way a scam the auto thumping system is very very bad you can not reach the correct pressure without overfilling your portafilter with coffee grain anyway it a fun product but knowing what i know now after having it for 2 year i should have bought the barista express,i wa wavering between the two but kept coming back to the breville i am happy to know that i am not wrong in my instinct and will be getting the breville,saved me buying a piece of kitchen clutter thanks,hey there could you please tell me the model and colour of that breville machine thank you,linked in the description the color is black sesame,i disagree with your review for the simple fact that not anyone can make a great expresso in short just beacuse you buy a 1000 frying pan will not make you the frying king i think you need to redo this video and let people know how to use each machine so that people can make an educated decision on wich one to buy and that my friend it is my review of your video,adam savage ice cold,mg mg yikes,adam savage lol abysmal that doe not apply to my comment stop trying to sound like you are very well spoken and or literate did you buy the dollar3 000 000 00 usd car,mg mg your english is abysmal so i do not think you should be commenting on anyone is reading and comprehension perhaps that is why nobody here is understanding your point what other factor would you like these two machine gauged on besides their build quality the ease of use the espresso quality and the steaming power,adam savage i do not think you understood my original point in a nut shell this person is telling you the mass that one brand is better then the other based on a simple this one ha this and this one doe not have it like my choice i do not think you understand about the purpose of a critic in any one point the only reason i mentioned so many flaw it wa because the originator did not understood my point either my advise please learn reading and comprehension before you post and or answer but in on a conversation how can you say this guy ha helped million if the million do not ask for a better explanation a to why it really is better but then again i recommend for you to buy a 3 000 000 00 usd dollar car because i am telling you it is my personal choice,if only i saw this before i got my la specialista,i am debating on going with a breville barista express or de longhi specialist marstro i wa leaning towards the breville however i am concern with the the espresso shot not being hot enough i personally only know one person who owns a breville barista pro and they have said the same thing what is your opinion,lifestyle lab thank you,any issue with heat on the barista pro come down to people not heating the portafilter properly before pulling their shot the barista pro is a far more capable and well built machine for le money,delonghi need to include a non pressurized basket a well and though they seem to be available 3rd party for 10 buck would like to see a gut comparison of the 2 grinder a well a the internals of both i owned a breville but returned it mainly due to grinder quality did not need all the bell or whistle either since i acquired genuine barista skill on traditional machine home prosumer commercial,can the grinder on the la specialista be modified i have a strong feeling that it can be done however it is good to see if it ha been done,the translation of this video to other language is super necessary please allow it on the video thank you and sorry for my limited english,hey thanks for the review it really made me do my homework i love the self tamping aspect of thing so i did some research and the la specialist came out with a new model a few month back la specialist prestigio it is a little more dollardollar but doe come with the single wall basket and better grinder can i get your thought on it because truly i like the quietness ease and simplicity of the la specialista the self ramping with no mess and quick start for morning espresso is a dream to me with that said i do want a quality shot what is your thought on the new model is it the upgrade this machine needed,jkb i picked up the la specialista prestigio newer model single wall basket loving it so far the tamping station is awesome once you get everything dialed in it a wonderful experience you turn on the machine insert the portafilter to get your grind going then tamp it in with the self tamp by the time you tamp the machine is heated and ready to brew build quality is awesome too not sure about the previous model but on the prestigio everything is solid just go to any store that sell both and you will see id definitely recommend it for a no mess easy morning espresso my wife love morning coffee instead of espresso and there is a setting for coffee which brew through the portafilter the entire time without adding water separately like an americano so this machine is definitely an awesome one for u highly recommend it best of luck with your purchase,lifestyle lab delonghi just released a new la specialista model called arty in new zealand and australia and the price is very attractive hope can your review on that model soon,the change made to the prestigio will still not address the critical complaint found in this comparison those being the low adjustment grinder and build quality that being said i am considering doing some more video in delonghi,i thought this wa a comparison with the prestigio this and other review had me dismiss the delonghi but they may also have reviewed an old model back to the drawing board,ditto,my daughter ha the breville and i just bought the delonghi before i saw this video my daughter must make really crap coffee with her breville please do not tell her i said that because the coffee that i get out of the delonghi is so much better a for the build quality i am in australia and maybe the breville is crappy here but i see no difference in build quality oh and did anyone mention the 15 bar pump on the breville versus the 19 bar pump on the delonghi not that i saw anyway,true espresso is brewed at 9 bar so the increased brew pressure on both of these machine is actually a negative more difficult to get even flow the higher you go in pressure,honestly id take the delonghi any day of the week understandably the brevlle pull a slightly better cup of espresso but the speed and convenience of the delonghi is just brilliant it is not a huge deal breaker pulling an espresso shot on the brevlle take like 90 second total where a the specialista take like 50 60 second mostly thanks to the all in 1 contained grinder into portafilter amp built in tamping 30seconds doe not sound like much but pulling 4 espresso shot per day is 2 minute extra through the year that is work out to 12 hour of me needlessly standing at the machine tamping and waiting on espresso not including the extra time though if i have got family or friend over and i am pulling 4 12 shot for that particular night or the extra time cleaning spilt grind when self tamping the brevlle is a superb machine just not for me ended up pickup up the laspecialista for 33percent off,dodged a bullet here bought the delonghi today because it wa on special machine did not work out of the box took it back to store and exchanged for the breville,thank you so much for the review just want to know if the 15bar in the breville is enough to have a great cup cafeteria grade of espresso or is preferable to invest more in a 19bar model,lifestyle lab and people mod the barista express to reduce the pressure to 9 i would be tempted to do the same but my coffee taste good so i would only do it if i had a real problem,true espresso in brewed at 9 bar the higher pressure is better idea is a complete myth,useful thank you,i love the italian delonghi compared to the australian breville with the tamper everything stay clean no mess lot more automated if you want espresso caffe or am ricano espresso is so good i will never go back to breville,omg thanks for this honest review i nearly bought the delonghi ill give it a miss,update bought the barista express and it fn awesome i love it,what about the de longhi la specialista maestro espresso machine,extremely overpriced for what it offer i highly recommend looking elsewhere if you have that kind of budget,let is face it the laspecialista is the winner hand down in the work place with a small number of staff simple to use much much cleaner tamper system much much quicker too it look great and far from cheap looking after a week of using the breville you waste so much coffee at the grinding side you almost need to create a daily roster for someone to clean the coffee mess at the end of each day still the breville is a great machine if you like to clean it after every cup of coffee if you do not mind this we will no drama,i would agree that the delonghi would be better for a small workplace if it had the build quality to match the look pressurized system will always be more user friendly in this price range and quality of espresso i would suggest going with a superautomatic if a workplace coffee station is what you are going for with people who are inexperienced with espresso in term of the huge mess you are describing a dosing cup or dosing full a you would use with any other espresso grinder will solve that problem instantly,breville tamping a bloody mess delonghi absolute joy why no mention of this must of a feature your review is so flawed it almost criminal,did you actually watch the whole review it is even mentioned in the summary towards the end,your comment is flawed he did mention it,we do love the taping system on the delonghi and mention it multiple time i think far more brand should adopt that setup even if they do not have integrated grinder,you are a breville agent how bias,we have no association with breville a very clearly disclosed at the beginning of the video,if you get it 50percent off would you buy the specialista you can get also an external grinder and use both option right,i would not even buy the specialista at 50percent if i am being totally honest i would buy a gaggia classic or something similar,i am very confused i went into the store to check the delonghi and it ha metal knob and button metal alum frame the machine is very well built is there a cheap plastic version of this machine a well,we review a lot of machine this one is not well built in comparison,i had two barista machine and both were working for only two year the first one stopped bouling water the second got problem with pressure indicator stopped showing a pressure i am not gon na use brevel brand any more due to very low reliability p s could some one just advise some good quality esspressso machine,take a look at gaggia and rancilio we recently reviewed both,delonghi bashing by a breville paid reviewer,not paid in any way by breville in fact we would make more money if people bought the more expensive delonghi,assume both have a burr grinder otherwise it a deal breaker for me thanks for the video,yes both are a burr grinder quality number of grind step however are not equal,can you do a review of the la specialista maestro i think that one us non pressurized basket i am wondering if i should get the la specialista maestro or save up to get the oracle touch,both of them have trash grinder horrible reliability and are super expensive to repair eureka oro mignon xl profitec pro 300 lower price for both gt gt gt oracle touch,lifestyle lab thank you,save up to get the oracle the maestro is not any major improvement on the la specialista and we saw how that review went,thanks for the video really useful in term of buying expresso machine,the only video youll need to watch to make your decision,i sell these machine your review is absolutely true great job,great video thank you,i went to buy la specialista on april 2020 during the lockdown i wish this video existed back then,fyi do not jam pack your video with ad that should not be your main monetization strategy,not really,have to say i completely disagree with this review i am a complete amateur when it come to making the perfect espresso however i have owned both machine and the delonghi is way better imo the reviewer doe not touch on any of the key flaw with the barista express noisy failed solenoid poor temp control excess water leaking i am a huge fan of sage appliance and have lot but after my barista failed for the 3rd time i moved to delonghi and it is much easier to get a decent cup especially for an amateur worth every penny,must say thank you to the talking torso comparison upload,not all superauto machine are pressurised usually the cheapest one are on which you can not set the grind fineness typically machine with 5 or more grind setting will have non pressurised brew group my jura ha a non pressurised group really only the mega cheap chinese machine or the lower end machine but despite it having normal screen it is sorta like a pressurised because of the thin tubing after the brew group i found that to build up much pressure superauto group make a nice espresso that is better than the pressurised basket but a bit worse than the non pressurised it ha le body compared to the normal basket but still doe not include that bit of harshness that i can taste from a pressurised semi auto,good video good thing customer service reliability and consistency wa not judged though breville fall flat on it face in those category both are overpriced for what you get shiny plastic aluminum and a cheap tasting espresso,delonghi cusomer service is non existent based on my experience i vowed a number of year ago to never get another delonghi machine of any type and i have stuck with that,could not agree more don t waste your money and buy quality from the beginning,i just cancelled my delonghi order thank you very much for being this detailed,why bother with a review when you have a clear bias,chris foster you appear to be biassed,well if you sift through this channel we have reviewed more than a couple espresso machine thoroughly and honestly and the opinion in these review are backed by year of industry experience not sure what to tell you here,lifestyle lab i suspect that coffee machine at this price level and above produce the same result when the user becomes used to and proficient with use of their machine i have the la specialista it build quality is robust and the warranty is long it produce coffee on par with any other machine and it built in tamper and other feature surpass many other machine but the way you tell it would have u all think it to be junk it really come down to preference and just snobbery,consumer should be aware that these two unit are not even close in term of build quality and final espresso quality especially because of how similar they appear on paper the delonghi ha some great feature such a americano mode fast steaming transition and the very clever tamping lever but it build quality is very plasticky and the espresso quality is not acceptable for a machine at it asking price that is what wa communicated in this review,lifestyle lab suggest try to keep a flat tone of voice when comparing item,i have the barista express and there no mess if you wiggle the portafilter while it grinding the delonghi just look cheap and nasty,me watching what i want but can not afford,would you know of a product that ha the pro from the barista and also the pro from the la specialista then around the same price range,lifestyle lab thanks,in this price range and form factor the barista pro by breville is the most solid offering at the moment,sorry crap i v had a de longi now for 6 mths 100percent better than barista ha he got a head,sure,long bean love it,this is more like a hit piece then a comparison,certainly a little lopsided to be fair the tamping lever and americano setting on the la specialista are feature we miss on the barista express but in term of espresso and build quality the delonghi lag behind in this comparison especially when you consider the price difference,how much did breville paid you,absolutely nothing,very informative video thanks,thank you so much for this,vst non pressure basket is dollar10 at aliexpress delonghi won,except you will also need to buy an external espresso grinder to properly dial in with a non pressurized basket,thank god am watching this i wa about to pull trigger on la specialista now i know breville ftw,breville,gon na buy the express now thank you,hello is this the salted liquorice colour,did you recently remove a video where you advised people not to buy the delonghi la specialista due to it inability to make proper espresso can not seem to find it anymore,lifestyle lab alright good to know thanks,correct we did remove that video due to the oversimplification of implying that the la specialista is simply a dedica with a dedica burr grinder built in there are in fact some slight change to the filter basket and brewing the sentiment remains but we felt it wa a misleading generalization to make,so basically delonghi just made cheap chinese plastic copy of breville but they dare to charge more for it that is the rock bottom,violet solaire yeah i learn my self about coffie machine since these 5 month now i looking for somthing from bezzera or lelit or similar with copper boiler copper pipe inside etc,breville is produced in china both are full of plastic breakable and faulty,this is why i sell 50 breville to 1 delonghi,the delonghi looked so promising at the start of the video,it is a great looking machine,thank you for the comparison it saved me time money and frustration,you also forgot to say the big problem that the barista have problem to warm the water up another s dollar review nobody talk about this issue and is massive making the barista a useless machine,madpack i do not have this problem you need to know how to use your machine right,lifestyle lab we get people having this problem all the time so we have to demo machine at work to show them how to correctly work the machine more online video showing this on machine are needed,many user are simply making basic mistake like not flushing the group head not fully heating the portafilter until hot before pulling a shot measuring the temperature in the cup instead of with the proper equipment these are consumer unit a lot of misinformation out there,lifestyle lab it is im not the first and not the last go in forum and see that multiple person have the exact same issue,that is not an issue i have encountered on any breville machine most are quite accurate when measured with a scace device the dual boiler and oracle exceptionally so,got the breville barista express and love it,wrong information you can brew and steam on the delonghi it ha 2 different heating core i have it and it work,lifestyle lab i think he dosnt understand how the thermoblock work,lifestyle lab literally quoting delonghi and other reviewer,lifestyle lab la specialista is equipped with two independent heating system one thermoblock for extracting coffee and an independent heating system for steaming milk or frothing ensures immediate beverage preparation,not sure who you are quoting but again that is not correct,lifestyle lab la specialista is dual heating system allows you to brew espresso and steam milk simultaneously this minimizes the change of coffee taste due to temperature drop a you wait for your milk to be frothed which mean you can consume your espresso at the ideal temperature,great review i love it thank you very professional,i have delonghi la specialista thank you for information blogger my sister ha breville espresso i made ton of coffee cup on both of coffee espresso machine and from my experience i prefer delonghi la sp way better experience if you make late americano or expresso there are no difference between two machine on taste same taste delonghi la more convenient for daily use,do you know if super automatic a delongui dinamica ha a pressurized filter in it,yes most superautomatics will use a pressurized system to improve consistency,the delonghi would be so awesome if not for those gosh forsaken pressurized basket,andrei ayeee i am happy your happy with your purchase that is really all that matter thanks for the update,celly tyree alright from experience now bought the prestigio it is awesome misinformation here it an 8 grind setting not 6 still considered on the low end but honestly i have not had a problem with it for the ease of the machine it 10 10 if you feel the grind setting is not enough just get an external grinder personally i had no problem with the grinder a for feeling cheap maybe the older model i have never touched the older one but i can tell you the prestigio is solid all throughout switching the grind is the only part that ha a plasticky feel to it but i use the same coffee bean so once it dialed in there is no need to touch it again love this machine by the time the coffee is grounded and you self tamp the machine is heated and ready to make the espresso americano coffee hope this help make someone is decision easier but there is more video on the new model now a well,andrei maybe i will upload a video,andrei i did not want the spealista because it feel cheap to me,andrei i have a barista pro,you saved my day mentioning about plastic in the portafilter i do not want hot liquid run through plastic superb review,no matter which machine the tube inside are all plastic unfortunately you can search the picture on internet,it wa exactly my expectation before i even see your comparison excellent comparison thanks a lot,good comparison comfortable win by breville will you be reviewing the new la specialista maestro at any stage,based on how this comparison went i am not sure we will the maestro doe not really appear to improve in any of the area we take main objection to in the base la specialista,wow this is super helpful and insightful many thanks i especially appreciate the detail and description on the difference between and us for pressurized and non pressurized basket,not surprised at all de longhi product are typically junk,thanks much exactly the comparison i wa looking for i watched other video and they were nowhere near your detail de longhi should pay you for saving them all those return after people discover they bought pressurized system in disguise,that is so true,i think the real comparison is with breville pro,well the pro is better than the express and the express came out far ahead in this comparison so that would be a pretty easy win in favor of the barista pro,subscribed,i do not understand why nobody make a video breville oracle v delonghi la specialista it would be more comparing the same machine but not really because the oracle is way better with same feature by diff rent brand i search on youtube i do not find anything too bad,there is simply no comparison the oracle is a boarder line professional grade machine that can compete with higher end machine whereas this look the part but is really a repackaged version of an entry level pressurized machine and grinder thankfully this machine ha now been discontinued and replaced with the presitgio which ha upgraded some feature from the original to better compete with other bean to cup machine but to be honest it still ha a way to go to match breville quality,it look like delongui built this machine to seem similar to the oracle with a type of automated tamping and milk heating i have owned an oracle for 5 month and while it is not perfect it is significan notly better than this machine so making a video on both would not really be worth it the delongui is really an automatic machine pretending to be an espresso machine there is nothing wrong with that if they are being honest about it but trying to hide the pressurised basket and such a high price tag is conning people,omg the most biased review ever,yuriy d i sell both machine and this review is accurate i think you just bought the delonghi and hate hearing it be criticised,lifestyle lab honestly i think you were too nice about the delonghi i have played with a couple and they feel so fake in term of the metal imitation plastic build quality is awful considering the price,only really pointed out the very cheap feeling portafilter and the fact that the machine smelt very strongly of plastic for over a week after unpacking never experienced that before with any other machine,lifestyle lab good review overall but trying a little too hard to denigrate the build quality pointing out problem that are not really there,how so i literally had both right in front of me,it pronounced spetch eeah lee stah,please make a review about the new la specialista maestro,thanks for showing the breville barista portafil is much more solid and better quality,which are the unpressurised portafilters available on amazon that will fit the la specialista the portafilters for the dedica fit,i understand why you say what you say but the fact is any grade expresso is possible with the la specialista if you spend the time in getting to know it capability a an engineer there is often more than one way to design manufacture a product to accomplish the same result and la specialista literally knock the ball all the way out of the park the folding tray for shot glass is something that make the express look barebones the chrome casing of the la specialista run circle around the cheaper appearing express just the opposite of what you are blind to see the integrated tamper of the specialista next to and compared and contrasted towards the express is like showing a roll royce next to a cheap japanese car like a toyota the latter having to manually do the tamping by hand perhaps the flintstone car and fred having to use his foot is another example of just how stone age the technology of the express is the steam of the specialista again ha automation and control overall the express may well have some different hole in it is filter but to travel 150 mph you do not need to have a ferrari a most car can still get to that speed specialista pissing on the express just like i piss on everyone who deserves it,oh a comment from a true coffee connoisseur one that ha mastered the way of the espresso the way he yield his tool is impressive the way he push down on a lever that tamp coffee down for that non existent effect on a pressurized portafilter the way his reflection off of the chrome hood show his pensive brow knowing he is pulling the perfect espresso if the perfect espresso wa a coffee drink with no body watery taste and a rich nice head of faux crema he know his fiat panda can do 150mph falling off a cliff still he chooses to believe it is even the same a an audi a3 no a ferrari in my adoration to you chris i will only ever watch you drink your coffee a i do not deserve nor want anything brewed by your magnificent hand,jeremy rowe converting is all that take place you say robbed while i see the creation of all from nothing just like the ancient story from kemet alluding towards clay,christian kepler dude just let it go you got robbed,espresso not i my specialista is great i love it look quality and onboard tamping,sound like someone ha buyer is remorse,dodged a bullet there apparently,beeville so much better the flavor is so good from this expresso machine make sure you get the grind size and amount in the correct pressure gauge and your set and forget best extraction,i do not know i just love delonghi it is easy for home use no tamper needed,which would you go with the barista express or pro,i think the pro will be le durable with that electronics and kcd display in hot humid wet environment,the express the pressure gauge is really handy and i also prefer how the hot water spout is placed away from the group head,lifestyle lab perfect,boy do i have a video for you,this is like watching a brain surgeon explain the intricacy and complexity of achieving the quintessential perfect shot to the brain while pumping up our adrenaline level and thus exciting our brain cell which tell our hormone control centre the pituitary gland that there is an emergency the pituitary tell the adrenal gland located above the kidney to flood the body with adrenaline which also produce increased energy and stamen along with mental clarity and that wonderful euphoric sensation this gentleman in my humble view is the real la specialista,is this a re upload i feel like i have watched this before,lifestyle lab ahh ok,re uploaded silently to add the disclaimer at the beginning,great video fun and informative thank you,i like the tamping level on the specialist but that is about it,epexx 19 bar is about 10 bar too high to be cafe quality unless the 15 000dollar synesso i use at work isnt up to your standard,epexx so you think you can taste the difference between a 15 bar extraction and a 19 bar extraction lol i will tell you what you can taste the difference between a true single wall traditional filter basket and the fake pressurized one delonghi us you may have forgotten that part oh and the fact that you can adjust the extraction temperature on the breville which is very important oh and the grinder actually ha enough grind step to dial in espresso not five like on the specialista oh and it not built like a toy but in one way you are correct the people who read the box and decide to get one over the other because it say 19 bar cafe quality are absolutely delonghi is target market,heating temp is important dude 19 bar on la specialista breville only 15 thats what they mean by cafe quality,i would prefer stamping myself a i want to distribute the coffee a little before stamping and i also enjoy the process any clue why these machine do not have 58mm commercial portafilter p s to what espresso machine would you upgrade from barista express i wa thinking about the breville dual boiler seems to be missing in uk under the name sage or the rancilio silvia pro,these machine do not have 58mm commercial portafilters because they are not commercial machine a narrower deeper portafilter is le prone to channeling and therefore easier for beginner to get a decent shot with little experience and generally lower quality grinder you need very good distribution and grind particle consistency to use larger shallower portafilters in term of upgrading look at upgrading your grinder first it the best way to get better quality then once your budget allows move up to a prosumer machine like the silva or the rocket appartamento,great comparison a always do not know what delonghi wa thinking with this one,you can tell which company truly value quality and an honestly valued product over a deceptive money making machine,yea definitely disappointed,good idea with bad execution by delongi,agreed it look so promising on paper,yeah clear winner here and for le dollardollardollar,i think the la specialista is well thought out it is just competing in the wrong price bracket,the la specialista really is a ripoff
8,thank you great review,well i i will be ordering one for the household staff,great overview really like that they went with a traditional steam wand over the panarello,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,ok,ok,thank you for great review is it possible that using coffee powder in this machine if the answer is yes please explain how it possible thank you,i do not believe it ha a specific slot for pre ground but you could always weigh your ground and fill the portafilter itself to override the grinder,can you extract espresso and steam the milk at the same time in his machine,i would like to ask if this machine is compatible with bottomless portafilters,if you can find one others have said they can,love the way her presentation crystal clear,thank you,can you eplain to me what is c9 rober and where go i ca figereot,can you compare this with revile oracle,i would like to see how to refill the blander and water tank how convenience the process and etc,waste of money better buy a rancilio silvia or a lelit victoiria with a 58 mm grouphead and a good grinder,would you buy this one or the breville touch,they are both good we prefer the touch a it ha been out for a while and we are used to it but the integrated tamper really save the mess and this machine and the milk option to make it simple is better on the maestro,instead of milk can you use cream or even heavy cream that is thicker than milk,cream and heavy cream tend not to froth you may get somewhere with the manual wand but not the automatic feature,is that a flux capacitor on her shirt,good eye but with a coffee bean we roast in house our one point twenty one coffee blend include 88mph great scott atomic blend and mr sandman to name a few let see if you get all those reference,nice review but kan i now way the make it 15 bar way they make it 19 same the last one,i do not get it how can it over or under extract it automatic,grind could be off,i would like to see a video which you showing the difference using auto frother crema latte to make cappacino v latte v flat white and then compare those same three beverage to using the latte art arm to manually steam amp foam the milk,if you think that watery espresso is cafe quality i would seriously reconsider the cafe is you give your business to,hi i have a few question can i remove the bean hoper to refill can you tell me the height of the hopper i am trying to plan the location of a shelf over the machine thank you,only 8 grind setting,if it auto tamp why doe it have a gauge i figured since it auto tamp it would always be perfect,help with understanding the grind setting and volume of coffee put into the portafilter,i just got mine today can not wait to get the bean and start making coffee i follow with my review thanks,hello there i love your presentation i am very interested in this machine i am debating on purchasing either the breville barista touch or this delonghi maestro i am wonder if you could help by answering a couple of question how hot can this machine pull an espresso shot what is the warranty on this machine thank you,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you kindly,in canada it is a 2 1 year warranty so the best in the industry a for temp not sure on this unit but look at our other video on the hottest espresso machine the original is in there and it would be similar,i am in the process of choosing a next machine and i have all option open from a semi automatic setup quick mill or bezzera super automatic delonghi eletta gaggia babila or jura or this a it blend automation good look and manual creativity i would think the only similar machine on the market is the breville oracle oracle touch the brevile oracle ha a dual boiler pid control 58mm porta and heated brew group especially the latter is interesting to me doe this delonghi ha a heated brew group btw very nice overview of the machine,what did you end up choosing,la specialist maestro doe not have an actively heated group head and thank you,what is the temp like and temp setting a some like a very hot coffee and these machine can be luke warm,check out this video,great presentation from the lady very concise and clear information from someone who clearly understands coffee great video,glad it wa helpful,what grind setting did you use amp also temperature setting i have this machine but struggling to get to the optimal pressure i probably only getting here way up the gauge any advice could it be the coffee bean,adjust grind a bit finer avoid oily bean on the new one they remove the optimal pressure area a many have had that issue look at the espresso itself to see if it is coming out consistency should look like a rat tail sound weird but make sense,thank you for the great review the new machine seems to be significan notly improved compared to the original la specialista how doe it compare to the breville oracle touch in your opinion apart from the breville having a touch display are there any notable difference in term of coffee quality given you are in the optimal zone what about the quality of the automated tamping doe the fact that in the la specialista all part talk to each other in some way mean it is more convenient easier to get good result i have read that the grinder of the original la specialista had difficulty with dark roasted bean is this problem solved in the maestro,alex yes i feel delonghi false advertises on this with word play and it saddens me that reviewer are not mentioning the double boiler word play which this machine is not but everywhere you look it lead you to believe it is if you type in delonghi double boiler expresso machine this and standard model both pop up i have a serious issue with being misled,one important difference is that breville oracle touch ha two real and independent boiler this one can not froth milk and do coffee at the same time breville steam wand is really sophisticate ha also 4 hole and measure temperature on the the wand itself if you stop and start frothing it will end on the same temperature,dollar for dollar you get more out of the maestro the oracle is typically at least 30percent more while breville doe seem a bit better built there are advantage to both depending on the user we are actually launching a comparison video in a couple of week so stay tuned,hi i have just purchased the la specialista maestro and have yet to try it out my question is that when unpacked it did not come with the coffee grind waste pot or the jug are these separately sold if so where please,there are many milk jug and knock box option on amazon at great price,if you mean the knock box and an extra milk pitcher those are separate we sell them but only in canada we did an unboxing video here to make sure you got everything included,i own a la specialista and after owning it i probably would not buy a delonghi again,bokinyc what do you mean elaborate i brought one new and i would never after owning this one never buy delonghi again it is overpriced rubbish the grinder will not work how it is supposed to and it is hit and miss if the milk will be a i like it the frother some may put down to the milk i experimented with bout 8 different brand and it never wavered nothing like the promo video influencers always get checked and re checked 100percent working correctly machine some of u have to buy our machine and when we feel we get ripped off we tend to put our money elsewhere the next time just my own opinion i will not put my money into another delonghi i hope i elaborated enough,can you elaborate a bit please i have had mine for two year now and it is been pretty good can not complain just interested in what you did not like about it,i would buy breville over either of these any day i can understand moving this upmarket but you need the true up market credential and this just doe not have the total package sure it ha a few nice bit but all toll the price is just a huge disappointment,why is this machine even exist,i know right the improvement are great compared to laspcialista but the total package is missing thing the grinder range is still not great the portafilter is way undersized but at least it is a single walled the two heating system are good but at this price you can get a dual boiler to steam and brew at the same time though i guess with a grinder the price would be much more,very helpful sound promising do you know how much coffee by weight each setting eg 22 equates to,very nice introduction to the maestro i wa thinking of getting the original la specialista but now i think i may go for the maestro with additional grinding and milk option your intro video are much appreciated,yes i think i am doing the same dollar400 difference seems to be worth it,thank you,wtf for this price i can get lelit marax eureka mignon that will outperforms this weird machine from delonghi,for this price point they should have gone 58 mm 54mm min,tybaltmercutio you are correct it really is personal preference people tend to always compare and ask u about a 58mm size a the standard a it is the most common on commercial unit and believe this is the best way to get optimal espresso shot at home a you know there is so much more involved,i would be curious about ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear s view on that,i don t get your point here a larger diameter on the basket is not necessarily better for example also the commercial machine from la spaziale and dalla corte use a smaller diameter some people argue that a smaller diameter is is le prone to channeling and that in the larger diameter one the edge are more prone to tamper tilting others argue that the larger diameter may be better for the extraction in a double basket however for a single basket it should not matter a the effective size is reduced anyways from what i have read the optimal diameter size doe not exist and even expert say it is up to personal preference and or the context,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear they have tough competition from breville mind you breville ha a stunning lineup,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear how doe this compare to the oracle touch,look great look very improved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,i believe i know what they think they were trying to accomplish make a pseudo espresso maker for the rest of the people who have no clue to making espresso they included a self tamping grinder but made sure to not make it grind that fine because most people outside of the espresso world are not aware there are two different type of basket pressurized v non pressurized i think what they should have done is provide the machine without a grinder because pressurized basket are specifically used for pre ground coffee i think they wanted consumer to think they provided something special but under the smoke and mirror is definitely an inferior product heck even their top of the line la specialista maestro ha a grinder with only 8 grind setting and they include non pressurized basket not sure how that would go with only 8 grind setting,yeah it is really nut that the 1k plus espresso machine still ha an inadequate grinder,a few month ago i got a bottomless portafilter with a selection of basket from amazon made for the delonghi la specialista the brewing behaves completely differently with a non pressurized basket and needed much finer grinding to get the back pressure up on my breville smart grinder pro i had to move from an index of 10 to about 4 this suggests to me that the built in grinder is not capable of grinding to suit an un pressurised basket some of our favourite bean just do not work with the new basket while other almost non starter bean are proving to be really tasty i have taken to matching the basket to the bean and when i have to use supermarket ground coffee i stick with the pressurized basket the bottomless portafilter is great for a bit of a spectacle but is a pain when you are dosing into two cup so it hardly get used it look pretty classy with brown wooded handle,yup very true this grinder just doe not go fine enough for a single wall basket,glad you returned this it a piece of junk when it come to coffee i used to run an dollar80 setup with a pressurized basket and a delonghi grinder cheap little espresso machine that i got good result with for what it is then i discovered when i bought the delonghi it made worse coffee than my dollar80 setup proceeded to take it back the same day due to the fact also they lied to me and said it wa unpressurized most likely an error due to the fact that you get an unpressurized version and walked out with a barista pro,yeah it is terrible there is a reason they changed it still the change they made still are not good for the price point when breville is around,3 month ago new version this machine is available lot is improve look like nice expresso your mashine made,joe varacalli i got one in b b amp beyong a a member 25 percent discounted price from already discounted paid dollar 529 plus tax really like this machine how i can watch your buddy video very interesting thank you and good luck,yeah the new one is way better my buddy over at lifestyle lab did a comparison with the new specialista and the breville you should check his video out if your interested in the new one,it is in the optimal range look at the needle by all mean get a new basket but it work a is,rocky marciano it in the optimal range cause i used a dual wall filter basket and my point is that the grinder at the finest level on a dual wall filter basket doe not completely choke the machine out so it is pretty laughable considering the barista express can do that on a single wall basket and it is a cheaper machine,will you delete this crit a well,good honest review thank you excellent point,thanks sparkle appreciate the kind comment,my machine is the same my wife bought mine for me for father is day so returning it o kinda sketchy for me but yeah no matter how many different setting i tried i can not get that dial any higher i am thinking the zone dial is just there for show i wrote to delonghi about it and still no response from them your video show it is a year old too i wonder if the manufacturer know this situation is faulty but ha it on the machine just to boost up the price for it,vicriv production inc 88 yeah check it out,joe varacalli what,yeah they ended up making a new one with basically ever single thing i mentioned lol it is called the specialista mestrale,this guy definitely know what element contribute to a good cup of espresso paying 800 dollar we definitely deserve a true cup of espresso also i would love to see how that wand form milk wonder if it can actually do the job,harry panini thank you very much consider subscribing also i have some review of machine that would be great for you maybe take a look at the barista express or the gaggia classic pro you could even do the bambino and get really wonderful result,oh shoot okay then i will skip i need something that allow me to do the latte art thanks so much for the honest review xd your video definitely deserves more view,the wand is ok it is a panarello so unfortunately you can not truly learn how to texture milk properly,finally someone that agrees this machine is a ripoff for what it is get a breville and call it a day,,i guess delonghi heard you and look like the delonghi la specialista maestro is non pressurized hopefully you will review it,yeah i saw that the maestro is prettty dang expensive for what it is but maybe i will give it a go since they updated it,quick question if you find it with a 50percent off would you buy it i mean you can get another portafilter by 20 buck and have both option with external coffee grinder comment,i guess but idk i think you would get much better value from a barista express and if you have an external grinder get something way better for that price like a gaggia classic pro or breville bambino,thank you it is rare to find honest review like this,thanks still doing more you should enter our current giveaway on fellow monty demitasse cup,here in morocco it cost 1500 dollar only a stupid man can buy it for double price,that is really insane you could probably get a rancilio silvia cheaper,very helpful thanks joe,,no problem if you have not entered the giveaway for larry is espresso link is below,tamper it 4 time and it work a great for a home machine it is perfect and do not fill it to the top there is a line that show you how much coffee you should put in it,thanks for sharing but yeah this is a sub par machine for what you get unfortunately i recommend it to no one,true this is not a espresso machine it is a pressurized machine it give you the illusion you are making an espresso but you are really not you can get the full espresso experience with the breville barista express at a lower price this guy here point out all the flaw and deceiving marketing of la especialista,yeah could not agree more and yeah i have a barista express now funny you just sent me that video lifestyle lab and myself just partnered to giveaway a gaggia classic pro,i have a la specialista and there wa a point where i wondered if i had made the wrong decision after obsessing over the problem through lockdown i can now make cappuccino and flat white that are generally a good a you get at cafe and often better i am rather pleased with that outcome but what wa the price to arrive at this state of affair 1 using my old breville smart grinder pro instead of the built in grinder 2 weighing the coffee in and extract out 3 taking the panarello off the milk steamer 4 streamlining the entire process to take advantage of every improvement i could think of i think the la specialista is marginally overpriced but i am no longer concerned that i have purchased a dud machine one day i will convert a dl l portafilter to accept an unpressured basket but the necessity to do so ha faded into the past and i learned that finding the correct brew ratio for your machine coffee combination is really really really important you still have to adjust the grind and weight to account for various change i suspect that letting the machine control everything will always result is suboptimal coffee,hi grace i did not remove replace the steamer wand i only took the panarello off so i wa using the neoprene rubber pipe directly into the milk this seems ok to start with but over time the pressure and heat of the steam conspired to allow the rubber tube to pop off very disconcerting to stop this happening i got a pack of small o ring from the local hardware store and used one with a tight fit to hold the tube in place it never pop off any more if i knew i could replace the entire steam wand i would but taking off the panarello still allows good latte art,hey chris i have just been gifted one and have found with a few adjustment it can make a beautiful coffee note op had issue with temp not getting hot enough but you can actually manually adjust this my question wa did you replace the steamer yourself looking at replacing the wand and have seen a few tutorial in doing so for other dl machine with the panarello but not this model in particular,wow this that is crazy how much stuff you added to the machine would love to see a picture of that steam arm you put on if you are on instagram definitely send me that picture yes and this entire youtube channel i created wa driven out of a desire to replace my super automatic i had been using for year because i and my wife were now home all day so we had more time to dial in and weigh out everything i am glad our pandemic passion have aligned you should definitely check out my other content and do not forget to enter in my gaggia classic pro giveaway we only have 7 day left to enter,im glad i went with the barista express it wa the porta filter spout for me much better on the breville,gary strader hi gary we were talking about the express which ha a one hole steam wand,joe varacalli the barista pro ha a 4 hole opening in a traditional style steam arm much much better,p m niceeeee so excited,joe varacalli i have already entered on both yt channel and instagram,joe varacalli i had no idea there wa a separate name for it true it not a strong a a commercial machine however i can get great latte art and super fine micro foam with the breville it take a bit longer to steam it but well worth it,bc u do not know how to make a coffee i have a hookah lounge and i have been using the machine and it do an awesome job,i am not sure what your saying or asking but yeah this machine look pretty and would make for a nice piece in a lounge my only point is that for what it is i think you will get comparable espresso from the delonghi magnifica esam 3300 with le effort and le cost,i would still buy it what is wrong with pressurised filter they do a good job too,savage savage breville more plastic different quality made machine this machine still metal all around even warranty much longer i have one this and very happy a month ago got one for dollar530 in bedbath amp beyond new model for dollar800 need more think,savage savage yeah but the breville also come with both so if you do not want to fuss you do not have to but atleast you have the option once you get the itch to bring your espresso talent to the next level so my point is the breville is cheaper and offer more and if you only want to use what come with the delonghi la specialista you should just get a super automatic like the delonghi esam 3300 or philip 1200 series again this is personal opinion,joe varacalli i think it is just so expensivr because it is more comfortable the thing is when you use pressurized basket the grind must be perfect and the tamp too with the delonghi machine it is easier and you do not have to be so accurate with the grind or the tamp what make it more comfortable,there is not anything wrong with them i agree with you here is a video i have explaining the difference the reason i think you should not buy this machine is that it is more expensive then breville barista express which ha a significan notly better grinder and offer a non pressurized filter basket if you plan on only using a pressurized filter basket you should go with a super automatic espresso machine something like the delonghi magnifica 3300,i bought mine for dollar550 if you try to buy espresso maker with metal body and good espresso grinder you are getting close to dollar800 dollar1000 looking at convenience this machine is great built in tamper is le messy and ha constant pressure look great easy to use if you have a little experience heat super fast 15 20 second very consistent shot bottom line if you are a purist you will not be happy if you are looking for descent good espresso willing to sacrifice some essence for convenience and you find a good price this might be for you fyi i get my decaf espresso at local roaster he will grind for 21 bar brewer and it pull shot no problem,the breville barista express is made of metal and cost le and also ha both type of filter basket i do agree with you that the tamping station is clean and everything but if you can only use your machine with a pressurized filter basket why not just get a one touch super automatic espresso machine the one touch system would be cleaner and even more convenient so other then look i do not know any other reason this machine exists it sound like you are in it for the look though which i will say yes you are right idk what you mean at the end when you talk about a coffee shop grinding for a 21 bar brewer all espresso machine are set to pull shot at 9 bar the extra bar that the delonghi is rated for is for steaming,i am always curious when reviewer complain about something technical like basket type or the pressure on a gauge have you done a blind taste test between the espresso produced by this machine versus a non pressurized machine i could care le how my espresso is made if it taste great ha good crema and good body,honestly do not even need a blind taste the temperature doe not seem right the pressure not right the running time seems off i can pretty much assure the taste is vividly different even for the amateur,just made this a couple week ago but i like the idea of doing a blind tasting a well where i do not know which is which i am pretty sure i would know almost immediately but i think it is definitely worth it,yes i have i am actually working on a comparison between the two now it is not that it taste bad it taste good just not great the mouth feel will never be a good a a shot produced with a non pressurized basket also this machine is 100 buck more then the breville barista express so in my opinion they should allow the grinder to go a fine a the delonghi smart grinder which ha the same part but grind way finer,this is the worst machine you can have,yeah i mean they sell a 100 buck machine thats about the same quality espresso,bruh ville omg it bre vil,lol i do not even notice how i say it i will try and pay attention next time check out my latest video to win one,i am looking at this same machine and a few others not sure what i will go with how wa the taste right now i am using a cheap dollar30 mr coffee that ha a burnt taste,hank rojo very true coffee quality is the first place to start i will say starbucks generally is over roasted but they have a couple like the blonde roast that is not terrible but i would start with lavazza super crema to get started because it is cheapish pull a nice shot it is forgiving and u do not feel a bad about wasting a bunch of super nice bean if your just learning,easiest thing is to decide if you want this to become a hobby of sort if you do not want ccf to sail in and everything the delonghi la specialista is ok but going with a super automatic would be better and cleaner,also if you keep getting that burnt taste a long a you are not over extracting could be the bean you are using i am using an organic shade grown mexican coffee medium to dark roast it is a winner for me i would also recommend not using starbucks bean they roast them too dark you can see all the oil in the surface of the bean the oil will clog up your grinder un le you have a commercial grade one and know how to clean the burr and chute,jd joyridetv yeah it probably is very bad at temp regulation amid many other thing also it is probably steam driven not pump driven again not great barista express is great that is what i use now also if you really want to go all out getting a silvia or dual boiler by bee like with a bartza grinder would be pretty awesome a well,joe varacalli yeah it is a espresso machine from walmart lol i am looking at the breville barista now,your grind is not fine enough thats why the pressure is low cause the water is going through the coffee too easily look how fast the poor is you filled that espresso cup pretty fast try a finer grind man,delitemyheart nothing wrong with that,joe varacalli i had the top of the line breville machine and seperate breville grinder the machine wa good but the grinder just did not cut the mustard that fine adjustment of grind just wa not good enough the only way out wa to buy a commercial grinder which would have cost me more than the machine it self so i sold it all now im happy with my stovetop cafetiera,delitemyheart yeah most integrated grinder kinda suck the only one i have had good experience with are breville,joe varacalli thats ok my italian brother yeah in my experience all machine that have a grinder built into the machine a just crap and a you know a grinder that is able to make the finest incremental adjustment is critical into dialling in the correct grind for the coffee bean being used and different coffee bean and roast are all different and you need to find that sweet spot for whatever bean you use the only way is to buy a commercial grade grinder it amazing what a difference that make but a good commercial grinder is bloody expensive mate not to mention a machine i do not blame you for returning the machine ciao from australia e stay buono amico,in this review i explain that i am on the finest grind setting the machine can offer that is exactly why i am returning the machine because the grinder built into the machine doe not go fine enough sorry if i did not explain that well enough in my review,i have this machine fort about a week now and at first i wa disappointed even with the grinder on 1 the pressure wa to low there wa hardly any crema and the taste wa mmmm ok i used the same bean witch i used in my old delonghi full automatic with 23 000 cup on the counter i searched the internet and found a good coffee site and bought a trial pack of 4 different cafe new york coffee what a difference with the grind setting at 1 the pressure gage wa nice in the middle there wa a nice crema and taste wa very good ok it not a good a i want it to be but i know that good bean mean a hole lot of difference did i made a mistake buying this machine mmm i think it a beautiful looking machine with goog built quality it ha pro and con but for now for me it ha more pro than con,well that is good happy you like it for me i could not get over the flaw,i agree with you 100percent i like my breville cause i have non pressurized basket and it all i use i have to dial in the machine for about 3 shot in the garbage but it worth it for the taste,yeah having a dollar700 machine that doe not have a non pressurized basket is honestly silly,check out my latest video pressurized v non pressurized espresso delonghi la specialista fiasco,tr s mauvais test vous faites dur justement pa cher et le r sultat d un espresso est excellent vous auriez du prendre de cours de barista mon ch re ami aucune machine n est parfaite et si vous trouver que cette machine ne fait pa de vrai espresso vous avez un probl me de go t le basket pressuris e serve surtout obtenir une extraction uniforme du cr ma d ailleurs vous pouvez acheter de basket simple paroi et le grinder int gr fera le travail franchement c est une machine qui s attaque de machine 4 x le prix d achat je connais de gen qui ont laisser tomber leur breville barista touch pour celle ci seulement la oracle fait mieux,yeah i did purchase a single wall but because the grinder doe not allow you to grind fine enough you can not extract properly with a single wall basket if you go into any respectable cafe they will not be using a double wall basket they will be using a single wall basket 99 percent of the time,i do not own this machine but i think this video is okay i do not get why it ha many dislike,bimbeano yeah these are the two i recommend one is lower cost the other is higher cost but is more of a precision grinder and do not forget to subscribe i do video every week on coffee bean and espresso recipe etc,joe varacalli interesting i wa going to order a grinder for my parent anyway which one do you recommend,bimbeano no problem i would say if you get a better grinder and order a non pressurized basket you can make very very good coffee with it and hey maybe i just got a dud and the grinder can get finer who know,joe varacalli i bought it and then saw your review lol anyhow i got it to a point now where i am making coffee and espresso is that are a 1000 time better than my former very cheap machine we also renovated our kitchen and the specialista just look so good maybe in a couple of year i will upgrade to something serious thx for the review,remilia sweet that is a great set up it is pretty similar to just owning the barista express depending on what you want in a machine going up would be something like a silvia rocket or something in that class,could be a good machine when updated and compromise are fixed much like the breville bes870 which improved over time,now with the specialista prestigio all your concern may be corrected finer setting non pressurized filter three temperature a real wand nothing to complain with the new model i think,warren klein yeah i hope the people at delonghi have seen my video and lifestyle lab video a well we are actual reviewer not people trying to sell a machine like others do,i am confused between this one and breville 870 if u have test that breville please take some review thanks bro,trung vu duc you end up going with something else,never mind bro,,sorry i never responded to you i just made my 870 review today i will send you the post once it is done uploading,how often we need to service the machine is it last for whole year without servicing im super new in coffee thingie like 5 min ago because i saw some ad on my instagram and jump me to youtube to find what machine is good at home thanks,service a in descale if so it is about every three month but you can hold off longer depending on water quality i mean you should descale atleast every 6 month again i am not a huge fan of this machine if you want something to set and forget i would recommend a super automatic and probably a great starter machine is the delonghi esam 3300 i just a did a review on,i have looked too long for an honest review if you got the money and time please do one for the oracle touch,gabriele biondolillo i will say the oracle touch seems like the best balance between a super automatic and a semi automatic so if you like to mess around with tamp pressure and grind fine but want to take out all the guess work and possible mess it seems to be the best machine out there the only thing i would say is that i would like to see a standard steam arm option instead of only having a panerelo,joey varacalli subscribed,yeah i am going to try and do a bunch i am going to set up a patreon account and use all the fund donated to buy machine to review i want to be very transparent and not take any money for myself,i think you hit the nail on the head here a slightly pointless machine it can not do what it is meant to do very well they have added all these neat feature integrated grinder auto tamping etc but all implemented badly seems like a missed opportunity to compete in this price segment,shaun mudd yes they could have truly competed with breville if they would have made this slightly more customizable by letting you adjust the grinder to go finer and give a non pressurized basket,have you or someone else tried to adjust the grinder level i wonder if that would make it work with the single wall basket instruction a per the user manual over time the burr will wear down and the quantity of ground coffee will diminish when the grinding adjustment illustrated on the 6 4 select the grinding level is not sufficient you can select a new grinding range proceed a follows 1 press and hold the b3 and b7 button together for at least 3 second to access the menu the b15 and b16 light alternate 2 turn the mode selector dial b8 to the position the b14 light remains on steady 3 select the new grinding range by pressing the b4 button 4 press the b1 button to exit the men if the appliance is left idle for about 1 minute it exit automatically from the setting menu and is ready for use again 5 turn the dial b2 to position min then proceed a illustrated for the first use 6 4 select the grinding level,rocky marciano sorry this is pretty old now you may have to refresh my memory on what we are talking about adjusting,joe varacalli could not really get it to work really how did you adjust it and how did you test the new setting to see if it had changed yes fella you tried it did not you,yeah i tried this and could not really get it to work i even got a phone call with delonghi they just wanted me to send the machine to them at that point i said to myself this is not worth the hassle even if the machine is much better looking and cleaner because of the integrated grinder,thnx for ur honesty review i prefer to take breville barista express u should to try,i will be doing a review of the breville here in few with some accessory i think are vital,someone give me his insta account,joey varacalli yes,my instagram,your the only one who i found that reviewed the machine very good soo thanks great video,thank you i really appreciate half the reason i did the review wa that i felt all the other review were from people trying to sell you one or from people that did not know the difference between starbucks and a locally roasted bean,why gay people always complain about something,lol,i have the same machine to get it more pressurized do not follow the marking inside the basket you have to fill the coffee about a quarter inch from the top so more coffee in the basket pretty much,yeah i have done that but only work with pressurized basket unfortunately it will not even come close with unpressurized,so what machine that you buy to meet your demand for true espresso feel,the most reasonable cost option that will get you a true espresso with integrated grinder would be breville barista express,it a perfect machine if you do not want to waste your time actually my friend already own breville he say ill return the machine cuz it messy and the tamper is cheap this machine give you a really good shot you can get the quality of a coffee shop you are talking about 19 bar dude just to remind,the main point of this piece of shit machine that it will break after few month i have one and after few month the pressure gauge is full of water and this shit company doe not respond however brevill ha a good customer service,joe varacalli i do not think that is correct see my separate comment for adjusting the grinder,epexx breville is a much better machine for true espresso ranchilio is obviously better but it ha a much steeper learning curve and it take a good 30minutes to warm up and a lot of time to make a drink,epexx also forgot to mention that on the breville you can manually take the burr out and make it finer a it age on the delonghi you have to buy a new burr no option to manually make it finer,i agree with you 100 percent like i said the part are better but they nerfed the grinder so if you want to use a non pressurized basket to make a true espresso you can not do it that is why i returned i wa looking for something quick and le messy then the breville but i still wanted the non pressurized basket sadly it truly doe not work,great video,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,could you use the standard delonghi portafilter basket under the additional grinder you have to fill with your separate ground or do you recommend finding a stand alone 51mm filter to use for the external grinder i read that the delonghi portafilters are slightly off from true 51mm,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,simplified espresso with this machine which is fine for most but your gon na pull a much better shot with your rancilio a long a you have a good grinder,bought a combo machine doesnt use tamper doesnt use grinder doesnt use the americano etc dial lol why did you buy this machine you could have bought a better grinder and machine i am so confused hahah,thanks for the video i just got my specialista and am loving it my wife is all about the decaf a well so i think i may end up with the same setup a you great info cheer,merci pour cette vid o j ai une version similaire de la m me machine et je n ai jamais r ussi avoir de vrai cr ma jusqu date m me l aiguille de pression ne monte jamais tr s haut au plus haut orient e 9h j ai essay plusieurs setting de mouture et de dosage mais au final je crois que la manivelle de tassage est la cause a ne semble pa tasser le caf convenablement te vous arriv avoir de la cr ma avec la manivelle de tassage int gr e,salut je suis contente d tre tomb e sur ta vid o je voulais avoir l avis d un utilisateur avant d entamer de d march interminables avec le service client voici me deux probl me le sifflement m talique ca m inqui te mais il n emp che pa le fonctionnement de la machine puis le filtre trop souvent l indicateur de pression va droit au rouge puis le caf ne coule pa constat un seul grain est rest coinc dans l unique trou du filtre tr s irritant a tu eu ce m me probl me avant d acheter un filtre unique multiple trous j ai constat que la pression est tr s haute dans l exemple que tu nous a donn est ce que le filtre d amazon est vraiment la solution bref je considere utiliser la garantie pour une ventuelle r paration mais j ignore s il s agit de r el probl me ou juste d un manque d ajustement de ma part merci pour cette vid o le commentaires prouvent que le service client provient davantage de utilisateurs que de la compagnie haha,le sifflement de notre c t on l a jamais r gler mais ca change vraiment rien c est juste vraiment fatiguant le son mais on pense la faire ajuster car on arrive proche de la fin de vie de la garantie pour le filtre ca arrive que tu doit le nettoyer c est normal pour le filttre multuple trou il faut que tu ai un grinder different car c est un filtre non pressuris le filtre d amazon est pa la solution su tu n est pa pret acheter un grinder separer mon vid o montre simplement comment obtenir la meilleur shot possible avec un grinder exterieur et un filtre non pr ssuris,not good at all,i own this machine too the very fact that you need to buy 2 extra thing just get a decent espresso shot is the issue because you can buy a breville barista express for the same price or cheaper and get a decent espresso shot out of the box,bonjour nous avon une specialista et nous somme vraiment tr s d u car tr s peu de mousse sur cette machine,vous parler de la crema ou la mousse du caf pour le caf il faut acheter du caf frais n achetez pa le caf en picerie allez plut t acheter votre caf dans un caf sp cialis pour vous assurer de la fra cheur du caf,i reckon you put too much coffee in the basket that is why the zone went to the red area should be a little bit le full in regard to the basket i reckon,thanks heap for these video bro,i tried to buy the filter basket but they do not ship to the united state i will have to find one from another source i get good pressure using the grind set to 1 with the dual walled basket but the puck doe not knock out a clean a a single walled filter one guy machined his grinder down in his lathe and shimmed it to make up for the metal he removed that will get you the finer grind you want i have a lathe and may modify mine at some point maybe i should sell the modified part for those that do not have a lathe,i wa expecting to see a shot with the grinder on the machine and the non pressurized filter can you post that i would like to see the difference if i have to spend dollar200 on an extra grinder then it defeat the purpose of getting this machine i might a well spend the extra money for the new la specialista maestro that come with non pressurized filter,ben r depends what bean you use,i have tested that with my machine and it doe not get it fine enough,there is no way in heck that the portafilter is up to heat in a few second i owned this machine and the portafilter took closer to 10 minute to fully heat up why do you just get a more legit machine like a gaggia or rancilio if you have a smart grinder pro you will get significan notly better shot since it is using a 58mm portafilter,just pas water in it to heat it up it is not a full pro machine i like the convenience of having decaf and normal at the same time i agree the gaggia and rancilio are superior but le friendly to use for normal non coffee geek,did you increase the temperature cause mine brew on only 76 c instead of 94 c,guillaume bourdages press 2x and my at the same time for more than 3 second display flash then turn selector to espresso heating symbol light up press rins button for high or x2 for normal save change by pressing on off button machine switch off after 1 minute now water extract at higher temperature which increase the good amp tasty substance of the roasted coffee bean compared to the acid then i switched off the eco bullshit which no delivers almost instant steam,interesting did not know you could increase the temperature how do you do this,what is this red sign for,descaling,do you time your shot for weight and ratio i did a double shot and it wa around a 1 4 ratio if i did not stop it and just let it go it wa in the optimal zone too around 2 o clock,hi doe your delonghi la specialista portafilter still have a black plastic in it i have the unpresurize basket like yours but it can not fit it just make half way in because of the black plastic in it,hi yes there is stil a plastic coffee distributor in de port filter i bought an unpressurized filter amazon and it fit perfect even with the plastic distributor in it arre you sure you have a filter for two cup and not for three i think the plastic is easy to remove but in my case it not in the way,est ce que tu a modifi ton portafilter ou le filtre entre sans modification,sans modif le 51mm delonghi fit parfait,we must have purchased ours around the same time that you did our heater element went out and delonghi replaced it shortly after ours started making the same noise and sent it in again they said that it is normal and could not find anything wrong with it would definitely purchase this machine again we use it multiple time daily,do you mind sharing the setting you used in this video,grenade flick thank you,danial samat with the breville ginder i think i wa around the 13 mark and wa maybe 20g of coffee more than usual but this will all depends on bean and temperature you will need to dial in your shot and do a few try and error,grenade flick thank you for your prompt reply what i meant wa what grind size amp what ammount of coffee you used to achieve that particular shot thank you,see the video description for the link to the accessory,1 what 51mm basket did you use can you give a link 2 did you try a bottomless 51mm portafilter,see the video description for the link no for the bottomless super hard to find a compatible portafilter a it is unique to the specialist,should i go buy it we would use th default grinder we had the barista touch and could not get a good shot had the weight time etc correct too maybe it wa broken,grenade flick when you say a great shot with medium roast are you referring to a shot with the non pressurized filter,if you can not get a good shot with the barista touch you will not get a good one with this even the old barista is twice a good a this and cheaper,highway to english yes the grinder is the main issue however if you use medium to light roast bean it work much much better dark roast bean are an issue with this grinder,i always need to set the grinder to 1 the finest setting and i need to overdose and even with this the gauge doe not show the optimal level buy delonghi dedica and possibly the breville grinder you will save dollar300 and get better result and they will need the same space on your counter,the default grinder will give you great shot if you use medium roast bean anything dark roast will not be so good this machine is more about ease to use if you want more control over how you prepare the shot i recommend the beeville barista express machine,which filter unit did you use single or dual walled,grenade flick thanks i will order one of those single walled you recommend,single for the grind i am doing with the breville double pressurized with the default grinder,suck that you had to buy another grinder to pull a good shot which grinder did you use with the silvia,it still make amazing shot with the default grinder but with a beeville grinder you have more control also allow my wife to be on decaf on the main grinder with the silvia i had the rancillio rocky,a i saw your machine it is show the descaler signal the red warning on top of the my button,ra g delonghi provides a tube of descaler in your box of the machine using that kind of liquid to do that or you better using purified water,ra g i would use any descaler made for coffee machine,grenade flick thankyou do i have to use delonghi brand or just any descaler from supermarket will do i am from sydney,ra g mean you need to descale,what doe that sign mean my machine is showing same too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,i just received my new la specialista arte but i have two question that i hope you can help 1 no matter what setting i try i always have extra water in the porter filter and 2 how do you know if the bean i purchase is an oily bean thank you and great video,i am still waiting for a version without a coffee grinder,ahhh nothing better than seeing an american making fun of european language it is pronounced arte not art e how do you pronounce sauvignon blanc saveign blank,i guess you did not realize we are canadian where we also speak french if it wa french there would have been an accent on the e so maybe spanish but then delonghi ha been making up name lately for their marketing that do not quite make sense we are just having some fun sorry to offend you oh and both of the people in the video were born in europe too now off to drink our sauvignon blanc,new to the channel would like a meet the team video who they are where the come from and favourite coffee machine at different price point also some blind tasting from different machine etc i am in the market and have not decided yet also a video about single walled and dual walled info would be really appreciated but liking the art eh love from the uk,good idea,thanks,what wa your final grind size and also whats the rationale you change the grind size while it is grinding thanks,changing the size during grinding is required to ensure no damage is done to the grinder i will ask wendy what the size wa and get back to you but it will vary between the bean you use anyway,nice chemistry,glad you think so,am i the only one that wa yelling do not do it wendy at the 12 44 mark,hey niel you mentioned you have a super automatic machine at home which do you have btw really enjoy your video,i have a jura at home but i would choose a jura or a miele a my top pic then delonghi thanks for the compliment by the way neil,this is my latest purchase in the last month great machine,good choice,great demonstration made me chuckle i have owned this model since january and it is so easy to use with no mess delonghi are on to a winner,thanks for sharing,i like rebecca is video the best,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear ok the best of luck to her,we miss rebecca unfortunately she ha moved on to pursue another opportunity,i love rebecca also but they are all just a good,my only comment is that i find ec to be one of the most entertaining coffee channel out there hoping that you sell a lot of these,art eh lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,ahhh thought a review site would review his not read out an ad,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,everything i hoped it would be i love the simplicity of this keurig mybest kitchen i have had the old school original keurig for forever i decided to upgrade to button lol same great quality without having to measure your water this keurig doe all the thinking for you i also love not having to put water into the machine every time i want to use it simple and perfect,it is a complete nightmare to find replacement part for this machine nobody anywhere sell a replacement dosing and tamping guide,finally got replacement part delivered by the delonghi service centre today mega chuffed and happy to be able to finally use my machine,finally got replacement part delivered by the delonghi service centre today mega chuffed and happy to be able to finally use my machine,ok so where doe it get the water from,it is a fillable tank at the back,this came so close to being a great machine it is lacking a 58mm portafilter just like the breville barista express at this stage my recommendation for entry level espresso machine is the sunbeam barista max which lack the pressure gauge and dose control but doe offer a 58mm portafilter the first manufacturer to offer a gauge dose control and 58mm portafilter will get my business,jordan pereira not sure but but i already prefer the delonghi to the breville and sunbeam the coffee is richer in my humble opinion and all three brand require the double filter to make a decent strong cup,what size is this portafilter,personally i think the breville is terrible mine lasted only 3 year and my friend is also having issue with his the coffee from both sunbeam and breville is very weak and requires a double shot every time i have had the sunbeam barista max too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,ich hatte eine frage mus man bei dem milch sch umer selber ausschalten oder geht da automatisch au,hey ich habe mal eine frage ich habe auch diese maschine und finde da die milchmenge bei cappuccino latte macchiato bei einem single cup 50ml weniger ist habt ihr auch diesis problem,danke f r da video schmeckt der kaffee deiner meinung nach besser al bei einem vollautomaten in vergleichbarer preisklasse wenn ja warum denn da w rde ich gerne verstehen,kaffeemahlgrad zu grob der espresso l uft zu schnell und ohne crema kann aber auch an den alten bohnen liegen hol dir neue bohnen beim r ster mal diese so fein wie m glich und schau da der kaffee wie honig au dem siebtr ger l uft,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,ich find gut gemacht angenehmer ton und sehr informativ meiner meinung nach ist die maschine zu teuer da bekommt man schon einen guten zweikreiser rocket appartamento oder eine quick mill aber f r den einstieg ganz gut durchdacht nur recht teuer aber mit ein paar handgriffen kann man damit sicherlich solide ergebnisse erzeugen kleiner tipp stell den mahlgrad feiner du solltest eine durchlaufzeit von 25 30 sekunden haben f r ein verh ltnis von 1 2 also 18g espresso 36g in der tasse und verzichte auf diese milchkanne ein wenig bung an der dampflanze und dann sieht der cappuccino au wie im caf,vielen dank f r dein kommentar,tut mir leid aber diesis review ist sehr schlecht man merkt richtig das du berhaupt keine ahnung von der materie hast und dadurch manche viewer schlecht ber tst du erw hnst zum beispiel gar nicht das man bei dieser 1300 euro machine nur pressurized filter bekommt und man somit nie einen richtig guten kaffee produzieren kann weil die creme k nstlich produziert wird da ist in dieser preisklasse einfach zu wenig,keine sorge e kommt ein zweiter teil bin mit den einwandigen sieben die ich jetzt habe auch viel mehr zufrieden aber fur einen erste test ist e unvoreingenommen viel besser,sehr geehrte leute der de longhi specialista maestro ist von au en sch n aber der rest ist ein missverst ndnis f r da geld ist da man noch sooo viel an dem machen mus dann spare ich lieber da geld f r eine sage oracel touch f r 2000 euro und die macht mehr al eine unerfahrene de longhi,tolle angenehme stimme prinzipiell gutes video thumbsup aber warum zum teufel filmt man diese maschine total fusselig und dreckig und 4k vermiest voll die stimmung,wieviel kostet die kaffeemaschine,tolles video vielen dank meine maschine wurde gerade geliefert mir ist aufgefallen das da linke rad kaffeemenge deutlich strenger geht al da rad rechts auswahl getr nk ist da normal,mahlgrad um welten daneben hol dir am besten ein neues einwandiges sieb danach den mahlgrad so fein drehen das der kaffe zwischen 20 und 30 sekunden braucht um durchzulaufen viel spa,da aufsch umen ber wir nochmal,definitiv,ich h tte gerne mal deine druckanzeige beim auslauf gesehen,teigwelt ja allerings ich bin auch noch am probieren w re super danke,da stimmt musste auch etwas experimentieren kann ich im n chsten video gerne mal drauf eingehen bin jetzt immer so in der mitte bei der zone teilweise ein stuck weiter rechts,teigwelt da ist mir schon klar habe die maschine auch aber so einfach ist e nicht,da ist je nach r stung und mahlgrad stark unterschiedlich,gibt e daf r auch bodenlose siebtr ger,nein die musst du separat kaufen,vielen dank f r da video,ich habe mir die maschine auch geholt ich hatte vorher die delonghi primadonna class und wa soll ich sagen der kaffee au dem siebtr ger von delonghi schmeckt um l ngen besser wa ich aber ein bisschen bem ngeln mus an der maschine ist das wenn ich nur milch au dem latte crema system haben m chtest dy nicht m glich ist da ist beim vollautomaten schon m glich aber ansonsten ist eine top maschine kann ich jeden nur empfehlen,eugen ja leider da liegt an den delonghi siebe,w hle doch einfach rechts bei der auswahl latte machiatto au dann kommt anfangs die milch und wenn die maschine auf br hen umstellt einfach mit der ok taste abbrechen,mich w rde interessieren ob die maschine immer diese ganzen spritzer wie im video verursacht schaut nach ziemlicher sauerrei au,ach krass das die maschine mit der gleichen kaffeesorte deutlich mehr aroma liefert da h tte ich in der form nicht gedacht,die maschine steht auch auf meiner liste sobald meine gastroback mal da zeitliche segnet aber bei deinen kaffeeshots sieht man deutlich da diese viel zu unterextrahiert sind und viel zu schnell durchlaufen du solltest ein wenig mit dem mahlgrad rauf gehen bzw hier runter bei delonghi ist ja umso niedriger die zahl um so feiner der kaffee also feiner malen und die kaffeemenge erh hen die nadel vom manometer soll am besten ca bi zur 13 uhr stellung ausschlagen ansonsten gl ckwunsch zur neuen maschine,frank reinardt secureband ja ein graef sieb der siebtr ger m sste ausgewechselt werden,teigwelt matthias hat hier einen wichtigen tipp gegeben den solltest du unbedingt beherzigen ich habe mich f r 2 lieblingssorten entschieden und die jeweiligen einstellungen daf r notiert jeder kaffee hat seine eigenen besonderheiten um hier die besten ergebnisse herauszuholen sind entsprechende einstellungen sehr wichtig wa ich noch empfehlen kann tasse vorw rmen maschine und siebtr ger etwas vorw rmen die durchlauftemperatur ist eine glaubensfrage zwischen 93c und 97c liegt man nicht falsch,vielen dank f r den tipp wird sofort zum morgendlichen kaffee ausprobiert ich bin sowieso noch wie wild am testen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
