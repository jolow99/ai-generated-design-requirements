0,how many cup we can make per day with this machine,it is for home use so not really more than 10 15 a day,doe the coffee hopper need to be filled with bean for the grinder to work i can not get the grinder to work when i install the filter,yes it doe to avoid damaging the grinder,yes do not use without grinder full,let is see what happens there we go an espresso imagine that,will this work with the starbucks black coffee bean sold at costco i am trying to get one for my wife and that is the coffee she us,koi aquaponics starbucks ha many different roast but most of them are dark and oily if that is the case they cause problem in grinder the oil and this will happen on any machine suggest you have your wife try a different bean even from starbucks although we think she can find better,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear are there machine made for those type of bean,would not recommend using those they are oily and will hurt the grinder,how would i ensure that the pressure is at optimum,,i followed your instruction but the espresso is still really watery is it the bean the grind setting the sugar doe not float at the top of my espresso but sink any suggestion would be greatly appreciated,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you for the prompt reply so what coffee density do you recommend or brand i have lavazza 8 10 intensity i will start with the bean and try it out also the grind should be at the fine mark correct,likely a combination we have a new video coming out soon where we purposely make a bad espresso and then adjust grind etc to fix it every bea had a different density and roast level which affect the weight and brewing so each must be dialed on look for our specialista arte video soon,it is both actually and likely,warning do not buy the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville them pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,wipe your wand and you are off to go,purchased one yesterday still getting use to it but one issue im finding is the group head a real issue to insert at time once full of coffee,it need to be tight for the pressure to work it will get easier or get some food grade lubrican not to help,we just bought this so far good but i would like my coffee a little bit more hot any suggestion a how to get it a little bit more hotter,prewarm your cup with hot water that is about the best bet are you making americano,i bought de longhi la specialista and within few month it stopped working and their support center is not much of a help either and now i have expensive machine sitting on my kitchen counter a a deco think twice before you buy this machine,it should have a warranty not sure which country you are in but usually they are good just keep trying,i noticed the water softener filter wa not included when i purchased this machine is it ok to operate the machine without it thanks for sharing,it is just do not use hard water or well water tap is best depending on where you live,is the tamping lever metal,plastic,old model please rereview with last much improved model,we did one better,what is the meaning of my bottom actually what that bottom did,hi please let me know if filter are pressurized double bottom or not what is diameter of portafilter is grinder really good esoresso flow too fast on presentation,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear ok i will,this machine is now discontinued look at the newer version prestigio and maestro,i am a barista and i am leaving my work soon and i do not think i can live without coffee made by me so i bought this one and i hope it is good,can you purchase additional lattecrema attachment or how would you seamlessly go between different milk option,they do not work on the original laspecialista,garbage breville better,i do not understand how can this video be two year old being that today wa the release of this machine by delongai according to the email i got,they released newer version in the last month or two there wa the original la specialista now there is the prestigio and the maestro,thank you spent 20m trying to use it by myself and had no idea what i wa doing but now i have a coffee so thanks,you are welcome,milk come first in cappucinos,an age old debate,are not the basket pressurized an important factor for many,they are but we will have non pressurized soon for this model,just bought this for my wife but in red,is it suitable for commercial use around 100cup per day,nope this is for home use,my husband just bought this for me yesterday i love it just now need to perfect frothing the milk and my coffee will be perfect,i wonder how you could do that hmmm why do all pro coffee machine use the same style wand nah that can not be it,enjoy,nice review thanks,can i use for a mini coffe shop,would not recommend these are home unit,great presentation i wa wondering if this brand make extra hot coffee how hot can this machine make coffee i normally have my coffee at 95 degree hot thank you,on a home unit that is a hard temp to reach even commercial challenge at time you can get close with americano a the water is coming out at a higher temp i do recommend you go to a store that ha a demo and try it though first,do you recomend this for a small coffee store,no not made for commercial use,the video wa very interesting i enjoy espresso every day with delonghi is magnifica s i also subscribed to the channel please come visit me on my channel with love from japan,hi i bought this machine and i am having trouble with the tamper it doe not seem to compact the coffee overly well and making my coffee very watery what am i doing wrong,probably need to adjust your grind setting,i am sold that would be good addition on my yacht when i am sailing around the world seabucks i can make money i have a woodfired pizza oven and i sold a 16 inch margarita pizza for dollar35,how are you meant to dial in your coffee bean,you do not bother it only come with double wall filter basket in order to be used with any pre ground coffee bean on the market this machine wa designed to be a basic a possible with a big comprimise on quality this ha nothing on the breville barista express not even close,my husband bought for me a a birthday gift i love it,my wife bought for me a well for my birthday arrived today,this is a piece of shit do not buy it,i will make video to show that the machine is a piece of shit and i do not recommend to buy it at all,this machine is very bad and the pressure gage can be full of water and you can not use it anymore in addition delongi is the worst company to deal with,more of an advertorial than a review if you ask me that is a lot of money for a thermoblock espresso machine that doe a lot of stuff but none really good gaggia classic is a way better deal or even the breville bambino plus for a couple of dollar le and with the change you cand buy a decent entry level grinder,i just bought this machine and having tough time achieving the optimal zone finest on number 1 and grinding it a few time while adjusting the dial the coffee level on recommended level and above also can not achieve the optimal zone,really,u need to rotate the milk when foaming even with this type of wound u will get better result,so happy that i did not buy this garbage only good looking plastic and too expensive take a barista pro 878 and you get something useful,on your comment about oily bean is it true that arabica tends to be quite a bit more oily than robusta i also heard that a a result of that you can get a finer and longer lasting crema on robusta coffee due to the reason that it is le oily and more co2 rich than arabica,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you so much i really appreciate your help,tomasz pasternak it is nice and easy to use probably the best tech we have seen at that price point,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear that is awesome because i have already been looking at both thank you is the auto milk function actually good and consistent on the touch if not i am willing to get the pro and learn to do it by hand thanks again,tomasz pasternak honestly i believe breville win for ease of use in that price range look at the touch and pro,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear interesting i will do more reading on that would you recommend your top 3 semi auto machine under 1500 cad thanks,can you pull a espresso shot and froth milk at the same time,you can not do both at the same time but you can do them back to back without wait time,dude if you like push button and get coffee get your self nespresso it is amazing no hassel,hi chef thank you for your comment nespresso machine can be the way to go if you are looking for no hassle but often time end up being very costly in the long term with the purchasing of coffee pod these machine are geared more towards those looking to have the barista experience with their machine at home,i would cry with gratitude,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear i can not thank god enough for my beautiful friend i have not celebrated last christmas yet i am praying for miracle today i will absolutely cry for year,it is a great item to add onto your christmas wishlist keep an eye out for our upcoming promotion,peut on faire caf latte,oui vous pouvez absolument,,55555,5 555555,nice video fun and informative thank you,can i foam milk while using the brewing station not sure if it is a dual boiler,it is not a dual boiler technically you have to do it separately the wording is that the heating system is independent,i keep getting the cloud icon error and it will not allow me to grind the coffee can someone help,glad the milk container wa over filled got a good look at the foam,delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine from your company this machine is delonghi bco320 about three month ago unfortunately a very bad experience the operating key is were bad and entered in the body of the machine such a a waterfall that aimed in every direction when i want to make esspresso cup this not what i expected from this italian industry and brand name but it seems that you have adopted a new policy of losing customer the machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise,that is too bad ibrahim i hope delonghi help you out with your issue note to reader ibrahim did not purchase this in canada through our company a we would help all of our customer out and are an authorized warranty centre for delonghi in canada,excellent review i have just bought this incredible machine i have one question how do i know if the coffee bean are oily or not is there a special kind of toast or something to know i am buying the correct not oily bean thanks a lot,jos luis c rdova p rez those bean should be great thank you,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thanks for the first use of the machine i chose illy classic roasted coffee bean is that ok again i would like to say that you have great content in your channel congratulation,avoid starbucks and bean roasted a french roast usually espresso roast is good but really it just mean looking at the bean and looking for a shine on them if they appear wet they are oily,we have had three of these machine all have leaked eventually got our money back amp bought a breville sage,john yao no idea they just flooded the kitchen worktop,where wa the leak from,bought one three month ago still working well with daily use the programmable button is perfect for me and my wife since we have different taste in coffee i like mine really strong and she like hers a bit watery it really depends on the quality of the bean how coarse or fine you want the grind and the amount this machine is really comparable to an entry level dslr if we are talking about camera most function are automated but you have manual option if you are really into it,allen l mine is 12 month old and still working fine,3 month ago and still working well with daily use i would hope it still work after 3 year of daily use,thanks for sharing,lol for a moment i thought you were doing the review in a random shop that just happened to have that machine sitting around d,i hope from your channel it is working video how to adjust the coffee and adjust the strength of the bar and how to set the mill to get out pavel espresso coffee cup,great suggestion,hello i bought this machine but it doe not adjust the coffee for me every time i am having difficulty tuning it my brother ha a sage pro which is better than delaunki in term of extracting coffee,check out our video on getting to the optimal zone the big thing will be grind channeling of coffee and amount used at the end of the day brew what you like and do not get too worried about meeting criterion what matter is your taste satisfaction most,why you have not tried coffee button,great review,i like some of the idea put into this machine but sadly i feel at this price point it fall flat compared to breville smart tamp station is great but pressurized portafilters and a panerello steam wand come on,i agree pressurized portafilter make fake crema the panerello wand is garbage tamp station is very gimmicky too this machine will not last more than a year of everyday use,hello i need an advice i am not a specialist but like a lot a good coffee can espresso from this machine be good a from professional one in the coffee shop i love everything about it but there is not a place where i could try coffee from it i used to drink a lot of coffee in italy my husband is italian and asked me to buy a coffee machine can it fit my expectation,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you i just saw a review of gaggia and espresso look way better it is not watery but creamy how i like i definitely will consider this machine i am not to much into design but quality of coffee it is that what matter thank you guy,todd is accurate and we agree look at the gaggia new classic a well a the breville line in the same price range they all take a bit of work and play but you can get a nice product with some trial and error just the way you like it if you are in ontario we have two store and you can come by and try in our store,todd soden any recommendation for non pressurized portafilters coffee machine for home usage i know i need to learn a lot before,joanna if you want cafe style result you need a machine with non pressurized portafilters and a traditional steam wand and learn technique on how to make a great drink this machine is for people who want to start into their espresso journey and it doe make thing quite easy but it take shortcut in area that would otherwise make it an amazing machine it is not a terrible machine but imo there are simply better machine out there for the same price i have also heard from many that delonghi after sale service is not so good if ec handle all warranty issue then no problem,with the amount you would pay you can get something way way better,sergei hanush those example doe not stop at that point you can pay a little more and almost get to the high end of coffee machine like the rocket giotto or mozzafiatto with a vibratory pump profitec 500 or 700 expobar machine ecm machine paired with a pid system for the best experience,sergei hanush plus that the steaming stick is not professional and not acceptable at this price tag it will not steam properly,sergei hanush if you want it with a grinder the barista pro from sage breville also oscar ii from nouve simonelli a great machine the con i see with this delonghi the portfilter basket is smaller than standard whitch is 58mm it come with pressurized basket the basket size of the delonghi is either 51 or 54 i can not remeber exactly which can not or hard to hold 18g of grounded coffee,show example for the price it cost it is a good product all good automatic machine 1 5k in cost,what i think would ruin this machine for me is i like doing the milk myself a a barista that is the funnest part i do not want it to be manual at all,lake bawson is having a stronk,what,i am looking at buying a machine it is out of the la specialista or breville barista express ha anyone got any advice on what machine would be best i should also note that i have zero knowledge of coffee and am coming from instant thankyou,thank you for your reply and input,either the barista express or the specialista the barista express is a bit messier but they both will give you great espresso with some practice,help so i have added bean in grinder but the no bean glowing icon keep flashing what do i do,you have to re set up the grinder and click it without the click will not work,make sure you hear a click when you first attach the grinder i had the same issue when attaching mine on simple fix seriously should mention it in a video or something it just mean the grinder is not attached properly,return it to the store and buy a breville in all seriousness though sound like the grinder already broke,could be a warranty issue try emptying out with the power off and start again,i bet you have all the label of your caned food all facing the same way in the cupboard,are these filter single or duel wall thanks,neil madden thanks,duel,ok ok i need to finally comment on one of these video doe delonghi have some dirty laundry on all the reviewer on youtube there is not a single negative video not one a a coffee roaster and barista for close to 15 year this machine incorporates literally the worst feature you could want in a machine pressurized basket portafilter not 58mm built in grinder dosing and tamping pannarello steam wand and the list go on the grind straight out of the machine look mile to course and if it wa not for the pressurized basket those shot would look a bad a they would of actually tasted why is everyone on youtube singing praise for this po,keep in mind not everyone is a barista of 15 year and doe not have the interest or time to master a machine while not for everyone it doe fit a need in the market for a beginner that want to start experimenting with espresso and is competing with the breville barista express they all have flaw in this price point with all they fit in you can buy a ferrari it you can buy a dodge they both drive but one is harder to drive and may be a better vehicle many simply can not afford a ferrari and frankly do not need it hope this help make sense for you,question when you do an espresso or a capuchino at 2x would you get twice the size of drink or twice the strength i feel my double espresso are very small the americano size is good thx,you get double the volume of espresso same strength in each theoretically,hey ec i am so confused about what to buy for our first beginner espresso machine want to make mostly espresso and the occassional americano we love the look of this and we like the built in grinder but i have heard bad thing about the crema on this machine we are also considering the barista express and gaggia classic any suggestion,sd1991 gaggia then,express is great and highly recommend a a beginner machine look great too gaggia too a it is italian you need to surf the water on the gaggia for milk but once you get used to it the machine will last forever still the barista express is a solid machine that outsells everything the overall favourite amongst our staff in that price point,i should say longevity is a consideration and we are not coffee snob or connoisseur,,same machine but when i make long black hot water coming first,i bought the 656 85 m first then the la specialista obviously i prefer the la specialista more,i wonder with all the bell amp whistle if this machine which look great is really any better than delonghi is compact machine the result seems similar and if one add is dedica is matching grinder which ha it seems much finer espresso setting than la specialista you have the equivalent for half the price,nice demo the 3 year warranty is nice i have used the barista express every day for the last few year with not one problem a real workhorse if this delonghi wa available i might have bought one instead it is a few hundred dollar more i believe both look similar with many of the same function i like the tamper on this the more manual version on the be can be a bit messy i will give this a try if my barista express ever break down,why change for an inferior machine poor grinder setting and no single wall basket result inferior espresso,thanks for the review this wa one of the factor a to why i bought this machine,you mention not to use oily coffee bean can you please give me example of which one to use and which one not to use or how do i know the difference sorry but i am just begging god my journey into the espresso world thank you in advance,vtecgoes not at oil oily is not bad or old just not great in grinder because of the oil,ok so the darker the roast the oily the coffee bean could be and is that a sign of bad old coffee bean,sure thing it is easy just look at the bean if they are shiny and wet looking then they are oily usually french roast but also some espresso roast non oily will be obvious when you see them compared,i have a few concern about this machine first at this price point why would they use such a small portafilter and second why only use pressurize basket i have seen other machine at this price point and they give you the option of pressurized and non pressurized basket,bill smith pressurised basket is the biggest failing of this machine it is basically fake coffee,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear what i would like to know is if an average double shot of espresso contains approx 18 gram of coffee to produce a 2 oz shot how can this machine produce a double shot with only 13 gram of coffee and still taste the same a a double shot with 18 gram of coffee,yes definitely we found the quality of the ninja sub par in comparison,we agree they are suggesting this for beginner but hopefully that will be improved with new feature and a single wall in the future,just bought this machine 600 00 at bed bath and beyond the no mess tamping no mess coffee grinding and no ground all over the counter top wa the biggest selling point for me the grinder work ok i would like to see a smaller grind to raise the extraction pressure many shot do not reach the optimum level while pulling shot but still make a good coffee the spent puck are solid and consistent and dry not watery but overall it a good clean self contained machine and make good coffee at the same flavor a peet is and starbucks if you know what your doing and if you use the 2 cup filter and for le than 20 cent per cup but once it again it make a good b grade coffee 90percent fully automatic and leaf no mess on your counter top or you hand you never have to touch the coffee once it put into the grinder,m navlar not having to ever touch the coffee is worth the extra cost of not having to grind it then pour it into the porta filter and have ground all over my counter top then have to tamp it and again ground over the counter top however it doe make good coffee and i am satisfied with it if there wa a better one on the market that did all those thing i would have gladly paid 1000 00 buck for it i get a 4 00 petes coffee for 20 cent every time,this machine is a rip off for what you get,how can you dial in a machine that only doe pressurised coffee it is a gimmick i will not have the same extraction a a extraction basket just pressurised air the sage barista is a better option imo,m navlar the machine come with with 2 different size of porta filter one shot and two shot the machine ha a setting on the panel thatlooks like this 2x you press it once if you want a double grind and double amount of coffee to go into the larger porta filter the dial on the left also meter the amount of coffee being dropped into the filter at the same time however the machine default to single shot and you need to tell it if you want single or double shot the size of filter and amount of coffee to be ground to fit the correct size of which ever filter you use it a very good machine and make very good coffee very trouble free and doesnt make a mess and i do not have to mess with coffee ground all over the counter top i use it everyday and make good coffee it also ha hot water on demand just press a button and hot water will pours out,how do you dial in your coffee for a 18 g in to 36g our in 27 33 second,yo tengo la de longhi magnifica desde hace unos a o y estoy muy contenta me est dando muy buenos resultados,great video thanks,hi i just purchased this machine 2 day ago i have try different grinding level and dossis amount but for some reason i can not get to the optimal zone would you please be so kind and provide some advice in order to do so i am dying to start making some great espresso,put on finest setting and get at or just above the line,watch this video on the subject,we have one of these and the americano is called long black on ours,what did he mean by box store,store like costco,doe it have any plastic part internally where hot water or coffee is heated or where it dispensed or anywhere where plastic get in touch with hot water,there are rubber ring inside where the coffee sits in the portafilter not sure why,there will be some internal part that are plastic to avoid this look for machine made in europe,hi thank you for the review i need help please to choose between breville or this machine which one do you recommend can i get the same quality in both mechanic,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear,ovwrall similar result most of our team have more experience with the breville so it tends to be preferred but you would be happy with either,i bought this unit today at your burlington store due to this video review the comparison video with the breville and the incredible employee who helped u test the unit she wa incredibly helpful and super friendly still coming down from caffeine overload from getting this machine all setup,thanks for your trust in u,ive sampled it a lot of button and bow but that is it the main package is weak go with the breville way better quality,lovelivinglife thanks again these grinder are almost a much a the machine any idea which grinder is best bang for buck i will try to make this my last question lol thanks for the help,ralph kramden you can not go wrong with either of those for that price range been around for year and proven for me i would go with the silvia simply for aesthetic lol only reason i chose the barista express is i own several breville item and always good but moreso wa with the grinder wa only dollar100 more than without for me i mostly do american cap latte machiattos etc i already have a good grinder when i really want to dial in for just esspresso shot,lovelivinglife thanks for that considering the gaggia or rancilo silva and sette 30 grinder any suggestion opinion thanks,a lot of cheap plastic the steam arm is cheap plastic with one thin sleeve of stainless cover which you basically have no control over a far a fine tweaking your steam the grinder ha minimal setting they only give you pressurized basket the self tamping lever is huge but fee cheap a well a the porta filter is fully enclosed in the grind tamp station you can not see the amount nor quality of your grind all in all the machine feel flimsy to the touch even in the video he say it give it somewhat of a commercial look and that is all it is a look not performance a far a the three setting for espresso americano etc the water run directly through the porta filter for the americano which anyone that know all that doe is create a nasty overextraction by running the water continuously through the ground basically this machine wa designed for those hey look at me look what i have people instead of look what my machine can actually do,weak in what area,do you know how many gram of coffee it us for a double shot,15 20 g,i just bought this machine after my 6year old breville barista broke pull a good shot the only issue i have is the milk steamer you can not control the steam it is either all the way on full force or off and then turn off after 60 second the steamer ha a foam setting on it but it doe not create a lot of foam the breville you could control the steam flow to get good foam i could about triple the amount foam from the milk in the cup the delonghi doe not generate a lot of micro foam any idea on how to get better foam with this machine i really do not want to return it because of the foam issue appreciate any guidance,sorry for the delayed reply but we have got some solution so first trick you could try is to remove the metal casing for the steam wand and just use the rubber tip from inside it just pull off and can be easily put back on you will not be breaking the machine second trick you could try once you are done steaming the milk cover your milk cup with your hand swirl it around and bang it on the counter a few time this should release some of the larger bubble and create that micro foam aesthetic,pressure is way too low is that intentional for your particular blend,sorry we missed this comment pressure wa lower on filming this segment than we would have liked we did a second video on optimum zone here a it is a bit more tricky with this machine to get there,which brand machine is best for self repairability in this price range dollar500 800,thanks,unfortunately there is not one in that price range you are dealing with mostly made in china check out gaggia new classic but it is a bit more,crap i am sold on it,question with this being a 51mm filter will a different delonghi unpressurized filter fit,genesis hi did you find a non pressurised filter basket did it improve the quality,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you i am very curious about this i know it is been done with other delonghi machine so i am very hopeful the ability to use an unpressurized filter would in my opinion make this machine a very tough bargain to beat i guess i need to take the plunge and begin experimenting,so we tested it to try to get an answer delonghi ha different sized filter which use a couple different method to hold them in so long a it is a standard delonghi 51mm filter it should fit,i owned a delonghi la specialista machine for a week already but i can not seems to bring the pressure up to optimal zone is there any problem with the machine or any adjustment i need to make for the pressure gauge to go up to optimal zone,thanks i will check out the video,have a look at this video,awesome job thank you,bella maccina forza italia,great video can you do a comparison with the breville barista pro,great idea we will add that to our video roster,is the portafilter pressurized or non pressurized also grinder seems not fine enough for non pressurize even though the tamping system is awesome and also is the dosing by volume or time,atlgatorupdate i received an oem replacement basket from an amazon seller in the end i chose to alter an original basket rather than worry about whether a different brand basket would fit the portafilter the alteration wa done simply by cutting the base off the basket with my dremel tool note if you decide to do this yourself be sure to leave enough of a lip that the removable plate at the base of the basket can not not fit through not rocket science but you need to have some common sense to do this in my case i wa happy just having an unpressurized basket i did not worry about the plastic routing disc inside the portafilter which is removable if i decided to remove that i would simply need to purchase a second portafilter to continue to easily use the pressurized basket result the system work perfectly with an unpressurized basket i still use the pressurized basket 90percent of the time a my morning are busy and i do not have the time to play around with dialing in the perfect dose which leaf my weekend to enjoy the process a bit more from the get go i have had the system set up to grind and brew shot that are so very close to what i consider to be my perfect shot that i do not feel there is enough of a difference to need to do this i do it only when i feel like being more involved in the creative process,atlgator exactly bit of a joke really,son lam nguyen update actually this wa a mistake the 13gram wa set to single dose i did not notice someone had turned off double dose when i measured i will measure again and post then former post i apologize i completely forgot to respond here i measured out a 2x grind from the auto sensor and received 13 gram that is my personal setting but there is still room to increase grind on the machine i am sure 17 gram would be no issue,son lam nguyen sorry it is taken awhile to get back to you i need to empty a basket onto my scale and do a proper measure before i reply i have just been using the dose provided by the auto sensor i am being very lazy i know in the morning i just want my shot lol i will do it tonight and will reply again,genesis how many geams of coffee can you use in at 51mm i have a breville 54mm and use at 17mm for a double,i brought this coffee machine about 3 week ago and really liked it one thing i noticed in your demonstration is that you were using the temper handle handle too many time delonghi in their manual book on how to use it say you only use it once but i guess it is up to everyone is individual like,is the temper handle made out of plastic or steel doe it feel sturdy and durable,yep just an arbitrary number the little ocd in me,my husband and i bought this machine about 3 month ago and we love it,i just bought this machine and having tough time achieving the optimal zone finest on number 1 and grinding it a few time while adjusting the dial the coffee level on recommended level and above also can not achieve the optimal zone,noproblem2big still going strong and still loving it best choice a far a i am concerned,i pick this one instead of breville because it ha a lower wattage 1850 v 1450 is it a bad choice,0709adri i wanted to know how this machine wa still going reliability wise but decided to buy the breville instead,noproblem2big tell me please what do you mean,a decaf requires more pressure when tamping is it still able to apply enough pressure to get a quality tasting decaf coffee,what is better the breville pro or this machine,considering it ha pressurised basket only tamping is not critical at all it will brew anything,we did not have any issue with tamp pressure once we got the grind and quantity figured out so you should be good,nice review can it adjust the temperature of the milk i like my coffee very hot can this machine do really hot coffee,it can burn your milk,hey winnie that is actually an interesting question that we have never thought about because the milk is heated by the steam the longer you leave it in the hotter it will get so really it is up to you how hot you want it the machine will automatically turn off the steam after a certain time though so in order to get hotter milk than that you would just have to restart the steaming on the same milk we would not totally recommend that a at high temperature milk will start to break down however it will certainly get it hotter,is it too hard to adjust the machine to have the pressure in the optimal zone range more 13 minute video but can not see the machine doing it is best,posting another video soon with some trick,not too hard realized that in editing we didnt show the gauge hitting that spot it did take u a few adjustment to grind and amount to get there but we did found it easier on the barista express to be honest though,nice looking machine it is like the breville barista with some cool feature,very similar in look and feel

2,i have loved mine bought in in 2019 and am so happy i did,drink every time she say yup,de longhi ec9355m la specialista i just opened followed the step for initial rise but system will not come out of the orange ok light and continues to run through the rinse cycle any idea how to get this machine running,how doe this compare to the breville barista touch,tchibo is good machine,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,fyi to everyone if you buy this machine there a chance the machine will not work a in the water wont flush and just make noise when you hit the hot water tea button and it take them more than a day to get back to you on the phone,is this made in italy,do you just add more water to make a normal cup of coffee if you want,this video rock 10 out of 10 best i have watched showing me how to use a la specialista very informational giving good and useful detail without crazy annoying music or obnoxious host thanks so much for making this video and sharing,i bought this machine it is a challenge to learn well they make it sound so simple it is a learning curve they need a video from unpacking to use,thanks guy very useful video now i understand how to program my coffee maker,i wa on board until you said pressurized basket out,bought this machine based on the recommendation of this channel we really like it although lately while frothing the milk bubble up over the pitcher before you can remotely get it hot enough not sure if it is because the milk is too cold the type of milk we have been using or because we have not recently descaled the machine ha this happened to any of you,part of the problem wa the wand wa not on properly but i still occasionally have this issue recently i switched to a larger frothing pitcher which help our fridge seems to freeze the milk sometimes which could also be a contributing factor,if it is still an issue try submerging the wand deeper into the milk over bubbling tends to happen if you get too much air in there you want to look for a few sip of air instead of a continuous gurgling and sipping easy way to do it first incorporate air into the milk and submerge the wand when the milk is volume is a you desire the wand should not make any sipping noise a of now but only stir the milk and create a vortex,put le milk,my wife bought this for me because i am a coffee lover and former professional barista having a job in an espresso shop downtown chicago honestly i believe that zone dial is there for show no matter how many time i tried changing bean and setting that dial never get into the optimal zone also my machine is way louder than yours on camera especially in foam mode what is up with that,i do not get into optimal zone either,for anyone looking to buy a new coffee machine i have used the la specialista for about 6 month now and i would give it a full four and a half star i have had some troubleshooting issue such a the coffee grind amount different coffee bean seems to affect it and the milk though it wa fine once i started doing it on a 45 degree angle no problem since then but all in all it is pretty good and make some decent coffee coming from a coffee snob living in nz and the coffee here is very good i have not given it a full five star rating because i have a feeling that it will not last for more than a standard 3 5year it is not built to last though i hope i am wrong on that one someone said in the comment that people seem to have a bias towards breville bought a cheap breville for work and it definitely make good coffee maybe not a much a the la specialista but pretty damn close for a fraction of the price also it seems like it is built to last no fancy button but it doe the job is not that just what we want so bottom line is you do not need to spend dollardollardollar buying an espresso machine bear that in mind next time you shop for one happy day,is this good for commercial use or just personal home use only,for me gail is the best person seattle coffee gear ha to demonstrate any and all the machine you guy have she is of course very experienced but most importantly she is clear speaking cutting through very well to the listener making it very easy to distinguish from different machine and make good buying decision a far a the other spoke person they are good but they stand a very far second place to gail on everything about demonstration on coffee machine i am sorry that i am so blunt and honest about this but seattle coffee gear is the one doing the sale not me i do not know what they would be without gail when she retires and i hope that answer is never,this video is a turn off want an independent review after gail is twentieth yep i turn this video off yep,my husband brought me a delonghi and i love it so far so good,you charge 700 pound for this a price way higher than the stonkingly good sage breville barista express and you only give pressurised basket are you serious hard pas,i wanted to read that review it is a good featured machine with a lot of item i wished he had done a capuccino to check out how dense the frothed milk came out with fhat advanced frothing system a always gail you do the best machine and technique review regard to arizona were you live now,if the machine grind and tamp properly there is no need for a pressurized basket that seem poorly thought out,he called it a manual machine what rubbish i hate this push button automatic lazy era everything is being de skilled although coffee making is one thing you can not successfully automate only a minority seem to want to put effort into doing anything properly these day get a sage barista express before they are phased out for the digital counterpart or get a pro machine,where to put water,with a pressurised basket and a very average grinder that is too course for real espresso this machine is not very good no wonder they had to invite the rep on to help cover thing up for the price this is a very disappointing machine and a disappointing sellout review,i do feel sorry for anyone who bought that machine based on this video look like they tried to make an oracle clone but it not much better than a normal fully automatic bean to cup machine,this is awkward lol,i have this machine that i just bought but i am having serious problem with the grinding it doe not grind and i do not know what to do,eh no sir that crema doe not look good,thank you,thank you this wa very helpful now i can enjoy my laspecialista,it is truly a thing of beauty,a,it is not working after 4 month and there is no customer service do not buy it,this is the worst machine you can have it is garbage,i just bought this machine and having tough time achieving the optimal zone finest on number 1 and grinding it a few time while adjusting the dial the coffee level on recommended level and above also can not achieve the optimal zone,hey jamie or gal can not you let me know what method you would use with this machine if you wanted to go with a cold style brew,why in the world would you include only pressurized basket on a machine that grind fresh bean that make absolutely no sense and to be honest auto tamp seems nice but i can not trust that the machine is going to dose the coffee corretly i would rather take out the portafilter weigh my dose and dial it in and tamp manually this is a hard pas fo rme,what do u prefer de longhi el specialista or brevel barista,the breville this specialista machine is garbage,this thing just look like a ridiculous piece of junk,pressurized portafilter 51mm basket bad grinder at 900dollar you would be better getting the barista express i sometimes see it at 600 700dollar on amazon,or the barista pro,jesus christ it cost a much a the breville but only come with the mediocre pressurized basket i mean it is decent to use when you do not have fresh coffee but a machine that cost a much should come with at least one non pressurized basket delonghi being cheap nothing new they should stick to making dollar150 maker,pile of junk for this kind of coin i would roll a cafelat robot and a rocky,how to set the coffee strength i e to make it strong or weak,learn the principle of making coffee you will know the answer,grind the coffee coarse for weaker coffee and finer for stronger coffee,i just got mine about a week ago i can not get into the optimal pressure zone despite my coffee level at the marked line of the portafilter amp the grinder set at the finest the extraction is way too fast amp the espresso taste sour may i know your setting that you were able to reach into the optimal pressure zone,theredtech98 i did a such portafilter is full the problem wa to lock the portafiter it became too hard amp almost impossible to get it in locked position i hv to settle with the suboptimal pressure well cappuccinno taste good though,search youtube for how to get into optimal zone a video by ec coffee explains it well basically just increase the grinding dose left knob and it ok if the coffee is a bit over the marked line good luck i just got this machine today to compare it to my barista express,i am looking for a real review sad that this is reviewed with a delonghi representativa there bummer,delonghi and this guy doesnt knew anything about espresso and coffee consumer,pressurized basket on an dollar800 machine is a deal breaker for me the smart tamper is cool but breville barista express to me is a better machine,i think the machine look nice but a a barista i do not think it would be any fun i bought a gaggia classic pro a couple week ago with a stand alone grinder i love it so far much more hand on,i would like a coffee that you use what wa it what brand,i bought one of these recently and so far i like it but dude when ur steaming the milk hold the jug on the palm of ur hand when it is too hot for your hand the milk is at the right temp if you overheat the milk it go bitter,i have had the breville barista for several year now i purchased the delonghi la specialist just recently for my home and took my breville to my office to use i have only had the laspecialist for only 7 month and it leak water from the tank into the tray overflowing onto my counter and floor i contacted delonghi and now i have to send it back for repair or replacement and do not know when i will get it back they told me at delonghi if it could not be repaired they would send me a refurbished one i told them if they sent me a refurbished one i would take them to court i purchased a new one and i expect a new one if they can not fix it i will never purchase another delonghi product again just because of their warranty and customer service i should have purchased another breville barista i never had an issue with breville i own several product from breville and never had a problem,lesson learned i figure,actually after this video i believe denloghi will fire this guy and hire gale,height is 17 5 inch,this is a toy compared to breville barista from coffee taste to build quality also something funny with this guy and excuse me if he is here watching the video usually in this channel people doing review with the negative and positive they do not do advertise we have the tv for that,when i saw it i though it could be a good competitor to barista express but it is not pressurized basket only six setting to the grinder and this milk froth system is a good a the low cost machine they make the only nice thing is the grind to tap they made so glad i bought the barista express,we bought breville and it wa so bad the flow meter wa broken,you know what they say copying is form of flattery,,wow most consumer want pressurized portafilter really that is sad,delonghi is sending me a replacement drip tray on my three month old machine it like to flood my counter and run all over the floor even when the machine is off the right back hole on the drip tray is too small lovely design flaw very disappointed numerous review on line said do not bother return it,i always enjoy your review gail but getting a brand rep to endorse a horrible machine is disappointing to say the least 51 mm pressurized basket that hold 13 gram of coffee for a double shot is a joke please gail make him a real shot and let him taste the difference,pre warning this machine look good but is 90percent plastic muhc better to go with the barista pro from breveil oh yeah same price point,read some of the comment delonghi have been around before breville notice that all brevilles use italian pump why should i go to australia to buy espresso machine and not from those who invented espresso have a lot more basic delonghi espresso machine and ha been serving me well not everybody is skill is equal that is why only pressurized basket and the wand that is actually making the froth art easier for you which actually i am not sure if i like and you see my reason i think myself classical barista i also have a radiator delonghi knock on wood ha been serving me quite efficiently several year in a row niente problemi,if you had visited australia and seen just how seriously people here like coffee along with the number of coffee roaster there is you would understand why most of the big roaster here were established by italian back in the late 50 such a merlo or vittoria so yeah there would be a reason for breville to put out a decent coffee machine,if this had something to take care of the milk i would consider it but in this price range it look like the philip machine will be the one it is not a attractive a this one but it about the coffee really,absolutly baddest show ever see,and more expensive than the barista buuuuuu,latte art not good latte not good of course espresso not good for sure so the whole video is just blah blah blah that guy is just a salesman,yeah they copied the barista express and made it somehow bad wtf hellooooo it doe not matter what feature you have if you start with pressurized filter then that is no especialista at all if you like espresso and you are at this level of espresso maker then forget the pressurized filter and any other crap quality espresso start with fresh bean then you need to figure out grinding dosing and tamping to get the right extraction so if you throw a pressurized filter in the mix just forget all that other stuff by the way the shot they did doe not look great like they were trying to make u believe very little crema look like over extracted which make sense with a pressurized filter now about the advance latte bla bla bla there is a way to texturize milk properly for latte art and it doe not involve any automatic sh t so bla bla bla bla,they may have copied the machine but just like the noodle they perfected it and it is made in italy so therefore it is better and that dude could not sell fire insurance to to someone that wa in a burning house,talk about not knowing the subject delonghi machine are made in china it is only italian in name italian people laugh at delonghi appliance in general because they are mediocre you want something that is truely made in italy gaggia bezzera and la pavoni are your best bet,would like to see a gail review without the company representative there for an objective review,i totaly agree,exactly my thought,lol of hate in the comment section,this machine is perfect for rookie i wa able to pick up a few tip from watching this helpful video thank you,lot of hate on this machine but i have one and i enjoy it,jess wong yes i had that problem and it is a defect with the water tray they replaced it and the problem went away i am enjoying my machine very much,anthony pardo any problem with leakage been reading a lot of review online about it,i have seen this machine in person and played around with it final verdict is the build quality is garbage v a breville the steam arm wa broke fairly quick too it look like a nice machine till you get up close personal and see how cheaply it wa made not worth the price tag,seeking a promo from breville they can send me one to compare i disagree with your assessment,with pressurised basket portafilter is always messy especially with this rubber on bottom of delonghi basket,you can call it delonghi style,only presur filter is not o k,do you sell bottomless portofilter for the especialista,people on here seem pretty partial to breville i just bought the barista and it came with a defective pressure gauge did the test that breville provides to make sure it is not a coffee operator issue and it wa indeed a faulty gauge customer service at breville ha been a joke so now i am really not sure i want to buy another machine from them although i do like it anyone else ha any experience with them in that area,wow buy a breville barista express or pro then cheapen it with le quality material slap on some gimmick aka no tamp tamper steam wand valve and call it italian delonghi design i am sorry gail but that thing is trash look like someone at delonghi said copy the breville make it cheaper and slap our name on it cause we are jealous of breville is success,very bad explanation how to get coffe into the valve,hot cup d,six setting only for the grinder,thats limited setting,hello gale,that will be a no from me dog,750 usd for well basically a automatic machine that is disguised a not automatic and with pressurised basket no thanks,oh dear seriously,now it is clear who design brevile machine which are later put up together in china,but is it effortless though,it ha so many button just to run hot water in so many way so pointless this video is like something from some second rate shopping channel the guy would obviously like u to think delonghi have just invented this stuff how quick wa that extraction 2 second preinfusion 25 second extraction i would not want to pay that much money for that,the only good part is the tamper built in so le mess otherwise breville briasta series is definitely better and also delonghi is grinder just can not get fine enough i think that is why they just do pressurized basket only,proof reading would help you,i had a delonghi machine and it lasted 3 month opened it up to investigate and wa shocked at how terribly built it wa basically leaked out and rusted itself in only 3 month time now i know the difference and will be stepping up to a quality machine a gaggia and once that one go i will get a rotary pump expobar very disappointed with how terribly built the delonghi machine are they are just targeting the dumb best buy consumer that is cross shopping with breville which is also sorta crap none of what you are marketing is advanced all of it is crap your internals are crap your grinder is crap make quality and push the limit of the consumer market that is how you can beat breville this machine is dollar750 what the heck,weird had mine for over a year now and still just a good a the day i bought it me and my wife have 4 6 cup a day each a well,this is the machine one buy to replace it 6 month later with a real espresso setup,do not waste your money on this buy a cheap secondhand delonghi bean to cup for dollar200 the coffee will taste exactly the same then if you want a real espresso look at one of the 58mm machine from sage breville and many others,spot on,breville copycat,im sure they will have a non pressurised attachment soon,saw this at a store it feel very cheap nexto to a breville barista while being more expensive no thanks,bb also just look like espresso machine,sorry gail love ya but i just can not lol i have sampled this machine at a local distributor or should i say looked at it the moment the rep started giving me spec i laughed and literally said youre kidding me right lol they needed something to compete with the breville sage in this range tried to reinvent the wheel with button and bow but gave nothing but a flat tire haha in all honesty i wa actually hesitant to even touch it a lot of cheep plastic and flimsy feel wont even mention how the grinder felt making adjustment oh and that rinse button why lol my list can go on and on buy you all seem to feel the same there is a market for it however those that have no clue but want to say doe not it look good on my counter,what is your recommendation please for the best machine to get a close to cafe quality,i think the dedica deluxe is the best model delonghi ha to offer overall after a bit of mod,w i am aware of everything you said and i agree with it my suggestion to the op still stand buy a breville it is an extremely simple solution to his problem,dbauernf you are missing the point this is clearly an effort to copy a breville i worked many year a an engineer designer and product manager the first rule of modeling another product especially one that is super well designed is that you must have strong selling point you either design it to sell cheaper or you improve the weakness of the competitor design but most important of u that you do not create or add more weakness in this case it is priced around breville it doesnt seem to solve any real problem a tampering arm and panarello wand is about the only differentiator i see here they obviously spent money on engineering that tampering arm and somehow calling it smart what is so smart about it no where do i see any information about the smartness other than it is integrated the paranello wand appears to be similar design on other delonghi is product and since it ha only two setting position you are can not adjust the aeration amount and these design do not usually generate velvety microfoam breville left it simple so user can have full control of the wand and generate perfect foam i saw one and used it in person and it is a bad what most people are saying just a poorly executed copycat,i own various coffee machine from different brand and after all these machine later i am convinced breville designer and engineer are far more superior to delonghi is almost everything delonghi put out ha flaw whereas breville product are just incredibly well thought out and perfectly executed,damn got so excited but then it hit me grinder suck portafilter suck pressurized basket and that steaming wand oh cmon i thought that there s gon na be another player by the side of breville but nooopeee,classical machine it must be cheap,what a waste it only come with pressurized basket at least breville let you use non pressurized one on their cheaper machine,basket is least flaw one one easily get them replaced with non pressurized what to do with light alloy portafilter and grouphead,de longhi la specialista is generating a ton of review due to leaking and leaving puddle under the machine and on to the floor this wa my choice and love it but those review have stalled my decision considering the price and how new it is that make me nervous,so this is a crappy full auto machine that you just need to manually change the portafilter from one spout to the other just buy a better full auto machine for that money,rasmus dyhr frederiksen no it is not the same concept it is a completely different concept it is a completely worse concept,exactly the same concept a breville which is much much more expensive but i agree stupid concept,enjoying watching your video this one like a show but the machine it is not worth it however they are plenty of people that doe not understand enough and will buy it anyway thanks for sharing,oh my i wa turned off when i saw that it wa pressurized only,not very impressive for that price,oh yeah having a badge on the front that say la italian name would be a great idea we will definitely sell more now the guy wa saying a coarser grind mean weaker coffee they are using the same amount of coffee in the basket so it is not weaker just under extracted and sour,just letting you know that your comment completely go against what wa said at 6 55 a you adjust the coarseness the grinder will adjust the grinder time so you are grinding more or le coffee so the dose remains consistent each time i have no idea how you managed to misunderstand that,i would not give a dime for a worthless pressurized system what is the point it ai not espresso false advertising also no professional frothing wand lmao no thanks sticking to my modded dedica,very bad try to copy breville with lot of basic feature in a shiny package price should be no more than dollar299,ajdin zolota no delonghi doe not make breville machine,i agree first of all no unpressurized filter,they make breville machine,delonghi and breville are not the same or same family company,that is what i thought,look like breville but not a good a a breville,i think this is a copycat of breville but fails in just about every area it is priced between two of the brevilles and try to improve some area that doe not need to be improved but took away the flexibility of the breville,event 42 a machine that cost over dollar700 should include unpressurized basket,1 eq 0 dot 99999 repeating basket is big concern for coffe enthusiast but so small cost to machine producer why not add one non pressurised with machin,z one can buy proper basket for delonghi machine i had ec145 which came with non pressurized basket basket is not biggest concern with this kind of coffee appliance though,that wa my thought the lack of un pressurised basket would certainly put me off if i wa looking for a replacement for my sage barrista express,could have been a great machine if it had the standard head with non pressurized basket,the grinder is way off the machine is a waste of money if you want real espresso the review wa not the best,could have been a great machine if it is priced around dollar299,the grinder is probably not up to the task,wow fantastic design look great oh yeah you just copied the barista express from breville sage,you can not see the tamper on this machine and i think it is not copied it is just inspirated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,i like,warning do not buy the delongi the breville barista express is way better than this machine the steam wand on this machine ruined the whole machine i have a similar steam wand on my shit box delongi dedica not very impressed with the steam wand delongi almost caught up to breville then pulled the pin with that rubbish steam wand that came from the delongi dedica i would rather buy the breville duo tempo from big w for only dollar299 than buy this rubbish machine for dollar650 go back to the drawing board delongi with your shit steam wand even better have different attachable steam wand i will never buy a delongi dedica even if it wa free because there steam wand are literally shit i prefer a steam wand with a tiny steam hole chump,thank you for the review i bought mine two month ago and i absolutely love it,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear keep up the great work you are doing i am following you from the uk now i am trying to make the best espresso still working,great to hear,where did you get the under machine double knock drawer from,that is the rancilio base if you are in canada you can get it on our website here it is currently out of stock but i believe we have ordered more from the supplier and you can sign up to be notified when it is back in stock,hey just wondering would you get better another microfoam with a single hole steam wand i am a barista and can not seem to get the hang of the wand with this machine,i just bought this and the pressure guage doe not move much why,grind setting could be too coarse or too fine,i own this machine and recently bought a pressurized filter so i can grind my decaf bean in another grinder without having to swich the bean in the machine grinder every time so my question is if the preground coffee dose and tamp are not perfect the pressure gauge will not be in the optimal zone but will the pressurized filter make up for it so i do not have to worry about getting the gauge in the optimal zone when using it,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear i have tried it and yes it work well even with the gauge under the optimal zone i had to try twice though the 1st time i did the same procedure i usually do with the non pressurized filter and it did not come out super nicely with the pressurized filter the 2nd time i used a separate coffee grinder and did the same thing i used to do with my previous machine which only had a non pressurized filter adding an approximate quantity of coffee that seemed fine and hand tamping it turned out great,it should make up for it at the end of the day if the product coming out is acceptable to you do not worry too much about the gauge,i love the video not sure if it is the machine that caught my attention or the lecturer,just curious do the steam wand and single wall filter basket retro fit to the la specialista i would love to at least be able to switch out the steam wand for the wand on the prestigio,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you for the quick reply that is disappointing considering g the machine are virtually udentical huge expense since my la specialista is just over a year old ugh oh well thank you again,wand no but basket yes,wow any professional barista would be able to tell how terrible this demonstration is not you a a demonstrator but the machine itself the steamer is definitely weak and the sound of you steaming the milk reminds me of my first day on my coffee making class,hahahahahah my kind of humor xd double wanded cup gt let leave it up there to keep it warm seriously xddd,can you make a decaf with another deposit,you can always use pre ground espresso and tamp it without using the grinder,what is different of 9335 and 9355,9335 is the original and no longer made,look like you make very nice and easy creamy espresso and pressure wa high too could you please open secret what coffee used thanks,we used an arabica espresso medium roast that we roast in house 88mph one point twenty one coffee,you do not tell u what the pressure actually is it just read optimal zone or what the temperature of the three setting end up being and you do not drink the coffee it make to see if it is actually any good that seems pretty weird honestly not sure what you are really reviewing here,hello alex by my experience temperature is between 92 and 96 degree with correct level spent some time to adjust coffee after press in optimal zone it is really nice cream on top no mess all taste is very subjective of course in home i do drawing on latte it miracle love this machine have a nice day,i love the machine made a spro that tasted like i put 3 sugar and honey in it bought my bean from ec too reliable just wondering if anyone know if a bottomless portafilter is available somewhere,what material are all the button handle tamper dropdown tray etc are those plastic or stainless steel,combination of both tray is stainless handle plastic,excellent presentation thank you,thank you,thank you for a great presentation it is informative i have bought one and loved it especially the tamping mechanism,is there a possibility of upgrading the steaming wand of the original la specialista with this traditional wand,ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you for the reply i wa hoping it had the same connection and it wa a straight swap,no it is not,having real difficulty getting that milk rolling with that wand not sure if it is the lack of mobility on the steam wand or the inconsistent pulsating strength of it,it best if you settle down to get the milk to roll,likely mobility,so i am
