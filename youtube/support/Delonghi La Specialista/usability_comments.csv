5,in france you would pay up to 850euros dollar923 for the prestigio in this price range it is unacceptable to have an imprecise grinder also i though it wa all metal before i watched this video covering plastic with fake chrome paint is so cheap i can not help but despising them for such a low blow how can you trust a brand after this btw in this price range you can buy a second hand mignon grinder and a brand new la pavoni or full metal lelit pl41 no brainer thanks for this excellent video,"['video', 'not usability', 'usability']","[0.622755229473114, 0.22756564617156982, 0.14967916905879974]"

48,you do not have to turn off the delonghi to re tamp you could just move and leave leave the tamping lever to a vertical position not returning it to the horizontal that disables the grinder until the tamping lever is returned to it horizontal position personally i prefer to use a leveller redistributer after which you may not even need to tamp if you have enough dose the bean in the hopper thing is a bit annoying but then when i used to use breville grinder removing the hopper wa a pita to put back on anyway for home use i see no advantage to having a lot of bean in the hopper in the first place with the delonghi you can have just a few bean in the hopper and it will warn you if it think there are not enough bean to deliver a full dose there is a huge benefit to consistent dosing i had ton of setting on my breville grinder but the setting had a lot of slop and tended to drift so did not help much i hated the slow breville steamer because it introduced too much water into the milk i find it interesting that this review managed to make it look like these feature difference favored the breville,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6915166974067688, 0.17087993025779724, 0.13760337233543396]"

51,yes but a lifestyle lab pointed out the coffee is not evenly distributed and if you tamp down on it like that you will not get a good extraction a others have pointed out you can just lift the tamping lever to perhaps slightly past vertical remove the portafiler and redistribute the coffee and retamp this doe not make much mess especially since the sensor grinder dosed just about the right amount of coffee,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7437621355056763, 0.16394364833831787, 0.09229420125484467]"

53,just got finished packing up the prestigio unpacking the barista touch and pulled a couple lukewarm shot i am scratching my head and thinking wtf have i done the prestigio is most certainly 100percent higher quality and i bought the upgraded version of the pro he featured in this review comparison the portafilter is much heavier by 16percent to be specific the whole machine is at least 10lbs heavier the water tank is better designed and more robust and the drip tray is by far a huge step up on the de longhi and the tamping system once you have it geez i do not know if i can be without it now it is so fast and clean and the smart grinding on the de longhi never overdoses even if you adjust the grind it is magic i feel completely duped by online review like this that put the breville on fake platform above all the others the people that buy a home espresso machine like this want something that is good value for the money reliable simple to use and effective we do not want a damn cafe lab in our kitchen with endless tweaking of this and that the de longhi prestigio did all that with flying color i am upset do not be misled by online review fml,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.41436946392059326, 0.3872247338294983, 0.19840577244758606]"

55,unfortunately i do not think there is a way to quantify build quality but the filter basket portafilter on the delonghi is very rough to say the least remove the filter basket from both and then re install them the filter on the breville is identical to any standard espresso machine the delonghi is thin flimsy any completely proprietary i am looking at these machine from the perspective of someone who ha owned and reviewed a lot of espresso machine at a variety of price point,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.6589245796203613, 0.2298230677843094, 0.11125241965055466]"

57,the barista pro is a more capable machine when it come to drink quality hand down the prestigio is more convenience oriented this wa clearly explained in this video if you are getting lukewarm shot on the breville the portafilter wa likely not adequately warmed it should be hot to the touch this is true for any espresso machine you have not been duped or lied to you just need to learn to properly use the machine,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.9107272028923035, 0.07536885142326355, 0.01390391681343317]"

69,bonjour i bought the delonghi is prestigio a couple of week while ago since i watched your video i understand why each cup of coffee with the same setting doe not taste the same turning off the machine before tempering is indeed a solution but for such an expensive machine pfffff what a disappointment i also noticed that when i have finally found the perfect setting for a great cup of single expresso and i push on 2 for a double the amount of coffee that come out is not the double of the weight of a single i am not sure to be clear enough that mean that the pressure change and that i get a complete different taste did you notice anything like that a third thing that i noticed ha to do with the steam nozzle the result of the milk froth is not always the same have of the time i get a result although i make it exactly the same way of course i tried many time with different kind of milk a you understand i am not satisfied at all with this machine and i regret i bought it could you please tell if you have noticed anything of what i wrote thanks juliette,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.6132481694221497, 0.19615983963012695, 0.19059200584888458]"
70,very nice video it helped me figure out some stuff about my new la specialista machine i would have a question though is it normal that the pressure is under the optimal zone when i choose the coffee setting instead of espresso i am not changing anything else i would say it is normal because it doe not taste sour like an under extracted espresso shot but i may be wrong,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.9151772260665894, 0.06748883426189423, 0.017333948984742165]"

73,thanks for the informative video one thing with the tamping with the delonghi thee are two way of tamping without grinding either turn the dose knob all the way off to the little icon or just leave the lever party engaged both will stop the grinding also there appears to be a setting to change the grind not sure yet what that doe,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8934506177902222, 0.1009078174829483, 0.00564156286418438]"

89,regarding your comment of not being able to remove the coffee after grinding to redistribute if you grind the bean then after this ha finished move the dose dial to the pre ground setting you can remove the portafilter to redistribute the ground before replacing the portafiler to tamp without it grinding again only a small point but important to note thanks for the review,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7849488854408264, 0.14055895805358887, 0.07449215650558472]"

99,regarding the la specialista prestigio there actually is a way to grind pull out to redistribute and tamp afterwards without turning off the machine you just have to rotate the very left wheel used for dose quantity to the bottom left symbol that avoids the auto grinding when putting in the portafilter,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8882704377174377, 0.07299070060253143, 0.03873883932828903]"

102,very true however then you will also be potentially changing your dose because you might not put the dial back to the exact same spot not to mention it the same number of button push in the end whether you turn the machine off then on or turn the dial off then on,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.579024076461792, 0.3452662229537964, 0.07570963352918625]"
103,what about the claim in the link below that prestigio make a bit sweeter espresso than breville due to new dynamic print fusion and consistent temping a well presigio brewing at 9 bar pressure with breville machine are extracting at 13 15 bar which can create an unpleasant harsh taste in the espresso a well high pressure are not recommended for non pressurized basket,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5020024180412292, 0.3003861606121063, 0.19761134684085846]"

108,lifestyle lab i think the actual brewing pressure will depend on the density of the ground coffee in your basket since breville pro doe not have a pressure gauge you can not be sure what pressure you are brewing at this complicates the process and you guess two variable to get a satisfactory result the complexity let the owner pretend to be an expert but no one can say at what pressure they brew their espresso it can be 6 13 or even 15 bar so it look like they have reason to claim that prestigio make a slightly sweeter espresso since with a pressure gauge you can brew at 9 bar,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6335513591766357, 0.22799359261989594, 0.1384550929069519]"

291,dbauernf you are missing the point this is clearly an effort to copy a breville i worked many year a an engineer designer and product manager the first rule of modeling another product especially one that is super well designed is that you must have strong selling point you either design it to sell cheaper or you improve the weakness of the competitor design but most important of u that you do not create or add more weakness in this case it is priced around breville it doesnt seem to solve any real problem a tampering arm and panarello wand is about the only differentiator i see here they obviously spent money on engineering that tampering arm and somehow calling it smart what is so smart about it no where do i see any information about the smartness other than it is integrated the paranello wand appears to be similar design on other delonghi is product and since it ha only two setting position you are can not adjust the aeration amount and these design do not usually generate velvety microfoam breville left it simple so user can have full control of the wand and generate perfect foam i saw one and used it in person and it is a bad what most people are saying just a poorly executed copycat,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.7325112223625183, 0.22091788053512573, 0.04657095670700073]"

491,just bought this machine 600 00 at bed bath and beyond the no mess tamping no mess coffee grinding and no ground all over the counter top wa the biggest selling point for me the grinder work ok i would like to see a smaller grind to raise the extraction pressure many shot do not reach the optimum level while pulling shot but still make a good coffee the spent puck are solid and consistent and dry not watery but overall it a good clean self contained machine and make good coffee at the same flavor a peet is and starbucks if you know what your doing and if you use the 2 cup filter and for le than 20 cent per cup but once it again it make a good b grade coffee 90percent fully automatic and leaf no mess on your counter top or you hand you never have to touch the coffee once it put into the grinder,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.9188355207443237, 0.05091641843318939, 0.03024798259139061]"

522,sorry for the delayed reply but we have got some solution so first trick you could try is to remove the metal casing for the steam wand and just use the rubber tip from inside it just pull off and can be easily put back on you will not be breaking the machine second trick you could try once you are done steaming the milk cover your milk cup with your hand swirl it around and bang it on the counter a few time this should release some of the larger bubble and create that micro foam aesthetic,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8595424294471741, 0.10030438005924225, 0.040153149515390396]"

761,hey thanks for the review it really made me do my homework i love the self tamping aspect of thing so i did some research and the la specialist came out with a new model a few month back la specialist prestigio it is a little more dollardollar but doe come with the single wall basket and better grinder can i get your thought on it because truly i like the quietness ease and simplicity of the la specialista the self ramping with no mess and quick start for morning espresso is a dream to me with that said i do want a quality shot what is your thought on the new model is it the upgrade this machine needed,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.605036735534668, 0.3221912980079651, 0.07277198880910873]"

769,honestly id take the delonghi any day of the week understandably the brevlle pull a slightly better cup of espresso but the speed and convenience of the delonghi is just brilliant it is not a huge deal breaker pulling an espresso shot on the brevlle take like 90 second total where a the specialista take like 50 60 second mostly thanks to the all in 1 contained grinder into portafilter amp built in tamping 30seconds doe not sound like much but pulling 4 espresso shot per day is 2 minute extra through the year that is work out to 12 hour of me needlessly standing at the machine tamping and waiting on espresso not including the extra time though if i have got family or friend over and i am pulling 4 12 shot for that particular night or the extra time cleaning spilt grind when self tamping the brevlle is a superb machine just not for me ended up pickup up the laspecialista for 33percent off,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7730882167816162, 0.14421434700489044, 0.08269742876291275]"

887,i do not understand why nobody make a video breville oracle v delonghi la specialista it would be more comparing the same machine but not really because the oracle is way better with same feature by diff rent brand i search on youtube i do not find anything too bad,"['video', 'not usability', 'usability']","[0.4269368648529053, 0.40895557403564453, 0.1641075611114502]"
888,there is simply no comparison the oracle is a boarder line professional grade machine that can compete with higher end machine whereas this look the part but is really a repackaged version of an entry level pressurized machine and grinder thankfully this machine ha now been discontinued and replaced with the presitgio which ha upgraded some feature from the original to better compete with other bean to cup machine but to be honest it still ha a way to go to match breville quality,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.5673181414604187, 0.3887768089771271, 0.04390506073832512]"

900,i understand why you say what you say but the fact is any grade expresso is possible with the la specialista if you spend the time in getting to know it capability a an engineer there is often more than one way to design manufacture a product to accomplish the same result and la specialista literally knock the ball all the way out of the park the folding tray for shot glass is something that make the express look barebones the chrome casing of the la specialista run circle around the cheaper appearing express just the opposite of what you are blind to see the integrated tamper of the specialista next to and compared and contrasted towards the express is like showing a roll royce next to a cheap japanese car like a toyota the latter having to manually do the tamping by hand perhaps the flintstone car and fred having to use his foot is another example of just how stone age the technology of the express is the steam of the specialista again ha automation and control overall the express may well have some different hole in it is filter but to travel 150 mph you do not need to have a ferrari a most car can still get to that speed specialista pissing on the express just like i piss on everyone who deserves it,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.49790528416633606, 0.3513227105140686, 0.15077194571495056]"

924,these machine do not have 58mm commercial portafilters because they are not commercial machine a narrower deeper portafilter is le prone to channeling and therefore easier for beginner to get a decent shot with little experience and generally lower quality grinder you need very good distribution and grind particle consistency to use larger shallower portafilters in term of upgrading look at upgrading your grinder first it the best way to get better quality then once your budget allows move up to a prosumer machine like the silva or the rocket appartamento,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.6755895018577576, 0.17745234072208405, 0.1469580978155136]"

1054,savage savage yeah but the breville also come with both so if you do not want to fuss you do not have to but atleast you have the option once you get the itch to bring your espresso talent to the next level so my point is the breville is cheaper and offer more and if you only want to use what come with the delonghi la specialista you should just get a super automatic like the delonghi esam 3300 or philip 1200 series again this is personal opinion,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6766519546508789, 0.17581404745578766, 0.14753404259681702]"
1055,joe varacalli i think it is just so expensivr because it is more comfortable the thing is when you use pressurized basket the grind must be perfect and the tamp too with the delonghi machine it is easier and you do not have to be so accurate with the grind or the tamp what make it more comfortable,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8261085152626038, 0.10346050560474396, 0.07043095678091049]"
1056,there is not anything wrong with them i agree with you here is a video i have explaining the difference the reason i think you should not buy this machine is that it is more expensive then breville barista express which ha a significan notly better grinder and offer a non pressurized filter basket if you plan on only using a pressurized filter basket you should go with a super automatic espresso machine something like the delonghi magnifica 3300,"['video', 'not usability', 'usability']","[0.8673779964447021, 0.07929302752017975, 0.05332894250750542]"
1057,i bought mine for dollar550 if you try to buy espresso maker with metal body and good espresso grinder you are getting close to dollar800 dollar1000 looking at convenience this machine is great built in tamper is le messy and ha constant pressure look great easy to use if you have a little experience heat super fast 15 20 second very consistent shot bottom line if you are a purist you will not be happy if you are looking for descent good espresso willing to sacrifice some essence for convenience and you find a good price this might be for you fyi i get my decaf espresso at local roaster he will grind for 21 bar brewer and it pull shot no problem,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.8267235159873962, 0.08903777599334717, 0.084238700568676]"
1058,the breville barista express is made of metal and cost le and also ha both type of filter basket i do agree with you that the tamping station is clean and everything but if you can only use your machine with a pressurized filter basket why not just get a one touch super automatic espresso machine the one touch system would be cleaner and even more convenient so other then look i do not know any other reason this machine exists it sound like you are in it for the look though which i will say yes you are right idk what you mean at the end when you talk about a coffee shop grinding for a 21 bar brewer all espresso machine are set to pull shot at 9 bar the extra bar that the delonghi is rated for is for steaming,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7847812175750732, 0.12767550349235535, 0.0875433087348938]"

1062,yes i have i am actually working on a comparison between the two now it is not that it taste bad it taste good just not great the mouth feel will never be a good a a shot produced with a non pressurized basket also this machine is 100 buck more then the breville barista express so in my opinion they should allow the grinder to go a fine a the delonghi smart grinder which ha the same part but grind way finer,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.6128999590873718, 0.3080664873123169, 0.07903355360031128]"

1106,shaun mudd yes they could have truly competed with breville if they would have made this slightly more customizable by letting you adjust the grinder to go finer and give a non pressurized basket,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.6475246548652649, 0.25680452585220337, 0.09567078948020935]"
1107,have you or someone else tried to adjust the grinder level i wonder if that would make it work with the single wall basket instruction a per the user manual over time the burr will wear down and the quantity of ground coffee will diminish when the grinding adjustment illustrated on the 6 4 select the grinding level is not sufficient you can select a new grinding range proceed a follows 1 press and hold the b3 and b7 button together for at least 3 second to access the menu the b15 and b16 light alternate 2 turn the mode selector dial b8 to the position the b14 light remains on steady 3 select the new grinding range by pressing the b4 button 4 press the b1 button to exit the men if the appliance is left idle for about 1 minute it exit automatically from the setting menu and is ready for use again 5 turn the dial b2 to position min then proceed a illustrated for the first use 6 4 select the grinding level,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7888287901878357, 0.12380137294530869, 0.08736978471279144]"

1127,epexx breville is a much better machine for true espresso ranchilio is obviously better but it ha a much steeper learning curve and it take a good 30minutes to warm up and a lot of time to make a drink,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.8613147139549255, 0.07636477798223495, 0.062320493161678314]"
1128,epexx also forgot to mention that on the breville you can manually take the burr out and make it finer a it age on the delonghi you have to buy a new burr no option to manually make it finer,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7516473531723022, 0.18810904026031494, 0.06024360656738281]"
1129,i agree with you 100 percent like i said the part are better but they nerfed the grinder so if you want to use a non pressurized basket to make a true espresso you can not do it that is why i returned i wa looking for something quick and le messy then the breville but i still wanted the non pressurized basket sadly it truly doe not work,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.7584238052368164, 0.2186853289604187, 0.022890836000442505]"

1333,die maschine steht auch auf meiner liste sobald meine gastroback mal da zeitliche segnet aber bei deinen kaffeeshots sieht man deutlich da diese viel zu unterextrahiert sind und viel zu schnell durchlaufen du solltest ein wenig mit dem mahlgrad rauf gehen bzw hier runter bei delonghi ist ja umso niedriger die zahl um so feiner der kaffee also feiner malen und die kaffeemenge erh hen die nadel vom manometer soll am besten ca bi zur 13 uhr stellung ausschlagen ansonsten gl ckwunsch zur neuen maschine,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6157931089401245, 0.26380133628845215, 0.12040553987026215]"
