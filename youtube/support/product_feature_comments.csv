filter holder', 'for what a stranger on the internet opinion worth you would struggle to pull it off due to the temperature fluctuation between steam wand and espresso with this machine due it single boiler you will have inconsistent shot if selling latte and cappuccino and if you plan on making any quantity of espresso the water will be quick to overheat and it wont be so great the pressurised portafilter while convenient will not give you the kind of shot that a dedicated grinder fresh bean and correct grind size and extraction will you will be far more suited to aim for something in the prosumer market instead with a dual boiler coupled with a good quality grinder use the rancillio rocky a a point of reference if you any question i am happy to help just pop me an email at elevatecoffeetraining gmail com the world always need more coffee cheer', 'if you hold the button either one or two cup the coffee wil flow until you release it this volume will be saved by the machine and all your following shot will be the same volume', 'i found the same thing though it doe depend on coffee grind size and like others i find grinding for this machine deeply frustrating you can of course change the volume delivered by pressing and holding the 1 or 2 cup button until you get the desired amount then releasing the button to program it', 'i have the regulat dedica machine i do descaling on it twice a year changed the portafilter every year because it clog and it doe not matter whar type of coffee i use it will not have much brown froth foam do not matter if i tamp it little or too much sometimes the coffee drip instead of flow also feel like the machine is really trying a double shot barely count a a single show in volume i do not really like this machine bought a breville machine for my mom that cost twice a much sooo much better', 'purchased the dedica a week ago and smashed through coffee that weekend love the machine great size which fit well on my kitchen work surface really easy to use and the espresso produced is fantastic make quick frothy milk ideal for flat white art bought my machine for gbp140 00 i have replaced the plastic tamper though useable is not ideal', 'hi there did you manage to make better coffee cause i have just bought this machine with the delonghi kg521 grinder a few day ago and to be honest i am not really that satisfied with the shot i pull they do not really have a body i know it is a pressurized basket so i am ordering another basket and maybe a second portafilter a well to make bottomless to do a non pressurized basket mod maybe that will make thing better compared to my capsule machine before krups dolce gusto it is not that better anyway if you by any chance got some tip that helped you grind size tamping whatever i would like to hear them', 'i just do not understand why delonghi doe not use standard 58mm porta filter 51mm is really odd can not get any accessory with this size', 'surprised i do not have trouble finding accessory but you are right why do not they all stick to 58mm and provide a portafilter to hold a standard volume of ground', '1 thing that seems to hard to pinpoint is the grind size the pressurized filter doe not allow espresso sized grind you need to go a little bigger that is why dedica grinder is a must buy', 'i set my grind size about half way between fine and medium any smaller

non est disputandum in matter of taste there can be no dispute it is a matter of personal preference some like the way french press produce the body some like it better with siphon but to me i like

down on how the contraption work pour over have some what le contact with the grind a the water pass through and for the press well it press the grind and this extract the grind to some extent of

extraction manualy i aim for a 22 25 gram espresso in 25 30sec if the brewing time is to fast or to slow i adjust the grindsize i hope this help you', 'alexander khioe maybe the type of bean or the grind size ha something to do with it i use fine grind 9 gram is the maximum i can use in the single basket the maximum coffee i can put in the double basket is 14grams', 'long time dedica user here here are a couple of tip not mentioned or fully explained in the video 1 absolutely do get the proper non pressurised basket you can get it on amazon or elsewhere either with the whole portafilter or just the basket warning the default delonghi portafilter ha a plastic part inside that prevents inserting a deeper proper non pressurised basket but with a little patience and a hacksaw you can simply cut a centimetre or so from the plastic part to make everything fit so you will be able to continue using the default portafilter p ka the pressurised basket allows you to brew essentially anything but you have very little control over brew time in this video they were quite lucky to get something espresso like in most case you will struggle to square a circle it will either choke or brew too quick or you will get inconsistent random result so definitely get the non pressurised basket 2 the button are programmable just push and keep pressing it for the desired length of time it will then remember how long you pressed it very useful when dialling in new coffee just settle on the right dose and grind size get the time right 25 30 s and next time you will get the same result consistently 3 use darker roast look guy i know we are all fan of the light roasted hipster coffee here but this machine can not extract them properly sorry for the allcaps but this point need stressing i learnt it the hard way so perhaps you will not have to if a specialty coffee roastery in czechia and abroad tell you oh do not worry our espresso roast is perfect for home machine they are lying to you it is still way too light roasted to be extracted well by dedica you see the machine doe not really produce high enough temperature even if you set see the manual the water temp to max i remember reading it only get to about 86 c which is simply too low for proper extraction of what modern roaster call espresso or medium roast what you will get will be intensely sour and unpleasant at least to my palate without sugar on the other hand if you use something more traditional doe not have to be very dark just darker than what most specialty coffee roaster usually offer you will get a quite pleasant traditional espresso thick creamy not too bitter not sour sometimes quite sweet i found that brazilian coffee usually work the best with this machine in short look for more developed roast with low acidity 4 steaming milk the wand ha 2 setting use them you can really produce quite acceptable microfoam if you start with the cappuccino setting get some air in and then switch to hot milk to get that vortex swirling going that produce very fine foam it take a bit of practice but it is not hard watch some video on general tip for milk steaming after you finish clean the wand and then you will have to open the valve again to let off the excess heat steam so that the machine return to the normal coffee brewing setting 5 comandante grinder setting naturally this will depend heavily on the coffee bean and dose you are using i only use non pressurised deeper basket and my dose is usually between 17 19 gram the corresponding comandante c40 setting are usually between 7 10 click finer for darker roast coarser for lighter roast be careful not to choke it machine totally you might rupture the o ring in the grouphead it can be easily replaced but be extra careful not to tear the thread on the screw the bed is made of plastic and it can easily happen a you try to tighten it then it will not hold the shower screen properly and the o ring will keep popping out replacing the plastic part is quite a pain in the as for the non mechanic like me so be aware', 'hi can you tell me the grind size for pre ground bean', 'hi what size of bottomless portafilter did you use looking to buy one and have the same machine but unsure what the exact size is thanks in advance and great video', 'you need a better grinder different bean require different grind size', 'i wa hoping you would share more tip on dialing in with the pressurised portafilter how much coarser wa the grind size compared to unpressurised how fine should one actually go did you use the single or double basket why did you use that 11g 30g ratio instead of 2 1 did you change the setting to the hottest level cheer', 'tomo l thanks for the response i find it interesting that you have used a similar grind size i still play around with my old dedica just for fun my daily driver is lelit elizabeth and niche zero and i noticed going a fine a possible would yield pretty bad shot i assumed the pressurised basket needed a coarser grind to compensate also interesting that you used 11g in the double pressurised basket mine can fit quite a bit more all very curious cheer', 'dan firth keep in mind that i bought this a my entry in the espresso world i can not really say how much better thing would be with a better machine gaggia classic rancilio silvia but once i got a good grinder a non pressurized filter and a botomless portafilter so i could really see and improve my puck preparation the quality of the shot is very very good in my opinion and everyone enjoys them a lot my biggest con would be the low steam power and being 51mm there are no precision filter basket vst etc and also the puck is quite thick for a 17gr shot also due to the small size is quite annoying to have a coffe scale while pulling the shot for the price i paid 150 euro 50 on upgrade i could not have asked for a better machine and a a newbie it ha allowed me to experiment and improve my technique i would be lying if i said i wa not planning on upgrading to something better but i am looking for something in the 1k range because i do not think a gaggia classic or a rancilio silvia would be a noticeable enough improvement', 'espresso und doch da stimmt so da einersieb hat nicht halb so viel volumen daher auch nicht die doppelte halbe menge', 'zu viel volumen zu lange ziehphase die verk rzen und mehr rollen', 'valter nogueira fair enough also the only setting you can manage in the machine is amount of time for single or double shot not water flow so it pump for x second and depending on the grain size you get x amount of extraction with the standard port til filter i think you get a single shot 30gr in le than 10 second', 'hey i have a big problem with my delonghi dedica style coffee machine it is brand new however a soon a i put in coffee in the portafilter the machine struggle to push water through jt or so it seems and basically only work for around 5 second and no coffee come out but when i take out the portafilter i see that there is bunch of water inside it do you think it could have something to do with the size of my ground coffee', 'i just bought the dedica ec785 not sure if there are any difference with ec685 watching your video and reading all the comment now i am confused whether to program it using time metric 25 30 sec per brew time single or double dose or volume metric achieve 36gr for single dose or 69 gr for double', 'saeed miramini i am really happy to hear that you got better coffee by increasing the tamping pressure after you got the new tamper i suggest you to adjust the grind size according to the taste of the coffee since not many people use the finest grind size of the breville smart grinder pro you may try to use coarser setting if your espresso is too bitter i hope you will get a better coffee experience with your new tamper and have a nice christmas', 'micdogg187 then the only reason i can think of is the grind size probably it is not fine enough', 'to achieve good extraction a good rule of thumb is to produce around twice a much espresso a the coffee ground you put in in the video 34 7g espresso for 18g ground coffee within 25 to 30 second you achieve that by tuning your grind size until it is neither too coarse nor too fine', 'nice vid what tool are you using exactly where did you get them what is the size of your basket 51x25mm', 'thanks mate so what grind size should i ask my roster toby is estate wa to grind to i have just brought the same bottomless porter filter a you too is it 14', 'size of your tamper d thanks', 'you can programm the time amount of water you can not set a fixed time with the dedica what he is doing in the other video is setting a specific amount of water the time will depend on you the grind and therefor change every time you change amount or type of coffee or grind size it is a bit misleading to say you can time your shot like that', 'alexander schmidt thank you for your reply i use the default portafilter so not the one in the video the dosage for a single shot if i am not mistaken is 7gr and i expect about 25gr out i have used all kind of grinding size commercial grinded coffee although i understand a difference in taste the extraction of 25gr is always much faster than the suggested time 13 sec instead of 25 sec', 'highfell1 good day thank you so much for sharing i have a similar setup with yours except i have the sage smart grinder pro i have my grind size at 6 but my ratio and time are waaayy off 16g in 68g out 26secs would you happen to know what i can do to fix this did you experience something similar at first too', 'the standard basket single dose seems to fit only 9 21 gram the 2 cup basket only doe 12 91 which is weird i would have expected double of the single dose basket the aliexpress portafilter i got 51mm fit only 17 barely but i think it due to the grind size not being fine enough and consistent using a blade grinder i can not find a decent burr grinder locally', 'tehral h so i am not an expert but do you have a burr grinder if you are using a simple blade grinder the uneven particle size could cause channeling', 'bro when change size grinder need to run spinning is it please advice', 'i set an automatic time change the size in grinding only', 'rancilio silvia v bezzera bz10 i i have had the latter for a couple of year and i am utterly delighted with it i recently bought a silvia to put in my office and l have been utterly underwhelmed a noted by james it is not possible to get consistent brewing temperature and so taste is inconsistent the small tray area and volume mean that there is always a mess on my bench afterwards unless you enjoy tweaking i would spend the extra on a heat exchanger machine like the bz10 it is soo much le fiddly', 'great video i have the delonghi and i can say if you are willing to experience with grind and stuff you are able to get an incredible good espresso out of it for this amount of money it is extreme you need the other basket that is true but i get extremely textured and nearly or sometimes absolutely perfect extracted espressoshots out of it 25 28 second of extraction 15 16g on 30 38g depending on how i like it i am normally more into 1 2 instead of 1 2 5 i could grind extremely fine and i found it reasonable helpful to grind 2 different type for one shot 10g extremely fine nearly like you would to for gastro machine and 5g one step coarse in fact that is the thing on any grinder there is literally no grinder who can grind every particle same size you have always more or le particle which are finer or coarse i take advantage out of this i could see video where people had to grind le fine for their 700 1500euros machine with the same grinder', 'what size vst basket did you use with the rancilio please james', 'why is there such a big difference in grind size if they are almost all 15bar', 'a question if anyone read this i bought the de longhi machine seemed like the perfect fit in term of it size and me not wanting to spend too much on an espresso machine i made a few espresso shot with the included pressure basket and portafilter and it seemed fine the coffee even had a nice crema but the basket wa too small i wa barely able to fit 10g of coffee into it yes i used a tamper a well now that my open bottom portafilter and a new basket were delivered i tried again even wa able to fit the 18g portion into it but the espresso now come out a bit too quickly and there is next to no crema i suspect that my grind is too coarse even though i used the minimal setting on my burr grinder the tamp seems fine and even though i am a novice anything else it could be', 'well the test of the bambino plus is invalidated if you are not using pre infusion and shot volume control especially if you are using the non pressurized filter if the shot wa not bad without these then it could be great by accessing these vital feature', 'i have a delonghi for several year already initially i had same experience what you mentioned i pressed button acccidently when holding machine but now i have no problem with that in setting it is possible to set higher water temperature this is what i did plus before shot i preheat basket always this machine also ha big advantage that you can put practically any size cup underneath the spout and even bigger if you remove drip tray so in other word i like it delonghi ha best price performance ratio in my opinion', 'james love your channel finally someone who pay attention to detail just purchased the breville bambino plus in oz mainly for space saving reason on a boat quite disappointed in the quality of the shot using excellent bean from a quality roaster that produce superb shot on other machine such a the breville infuser also using single wall basket not the silly high pressure dual wall basket that come with the machine here in australia the measured brew temperature is only 72 c a measured by an accurate to 0 1 c thermocouple on a fluke digital multimeter and out of the box it produced a double shot volume of 35ml which can be adjusted up to 60ml at least the pump pressure is obviously much lower than 9 bar leaf the puck dripping wet after the shot a weak anemic crema and no ability to push through a finer grind i e it choke easily but it is cute and doe good milk', 'i trust you were aware that you can select one of three temperature on the delonghi dedica you may have tested on too low a temperature the other advantage is that you can adjust the size of the automatic shot i am not sure the same applies to any of the other machine lastly i always use a fine grind using the square same brand grinder and with no problem have been very happy with the result the machine is supposed to have a 25 bar pressure which i believe is standard across most machine i would be very interested in your comment i would also like to see a critique of the various coffee you can buy at around gbp10 kg on amazon especially those labelled a italian espresso from italy to see which you think are good i like your channel for all the interesting coffee subject you cover so keep them going', 'i have a lelit victoria a step or 2 up from the anna and i am pretty unimpressed i have managed to dial in a pretty good shot but i am looking at upgrading issue are water reservoir is small and there is no external indicator to see water level so you can run out of water mid shot the steam valve is a round knob that you turn about 10 time to fully open a handle with ball valve would be much easier it is loud i had to put foam on grate mount because it rattled like crazy the stem pressure seems quite poor there is no preset for volume or even time of shot i used to have a lelit grinder which wa absolute rubbish it eventually clogged up and would not grind and i ended up getting a cheapo breville which is infinitely better it took 2 hour to open up the lelit grinder and clean the burr to make it ok to sell it should not be that hard to clean something which requires regular maintenance the breville ha very easy access to burr automatic dosing and a no spill hopper the lelit had dosing but you had to hold the griphead against a button for the duration the coarseness adjusting wa also very bad a there wa no visual indicator', 'i am in the process of looking for a new espresso machine and i am pretty sure it is gon na land on the gaggia classic the price to value ratio speaks volume here and i do not have the additional 100 pound to go for the silvia on top of that for the price of silvia in poland you can get the gaggia a very decent grinder like the baratza virtuoso thanks for the video james they really helped me understand what i am looking for and a big thumb up for the understanding espresso series', 'james i enjoyed your video however it raise the issue that there are different need i will comment on the delonghi dedica in particular thing you missed or understate but i mean no complaint size very good foot print for small counter basket insert no problem with two hand which i find i use even on full size machine water tank easy to remove refill and replace just slide straight down overrun tray it is three part remove the cover then remove the first tray and you have tray that can hold a regular size coffee cup so that my double shot for a cappuccino can go straight into the cup rather than first into a brew cup to be poured into a larger final cup or simply run double shot twice for a regular cup of coffee startup 45 second and you are ready to brew milk you need some practice with all machine with a little practice the delonghi dedicate gave me perfectly creamy milk and very importantly i did not have to use an amount of milk more than just for my regular coffee cup size cappuccino temperature the brew temperature can easily be set separately each for single and double shot raise the temperature to reduces the chance of sourness and bring out acidity dry touch top of tongue basket grind the factory basket i use only the double shot work fine with brand name coffee at a regular espresso grind i am happy with the machine it give me an espresso mine with a shot of cream and some sugar that is 85percent 95percent of most barista bar the pricey model are also not 100percent and seem to need modification like basket and thing to fix temperature and pressure although not 100percent for the price the delonghi dedica is in my opinion very good', 'happy owner of a heavily modded rancilio silvia here doe pid pressure profiling volumetric dosing if i would buy the right set of scale it could even dose shot by weight built like a tank self serviceable nothing not to like about it oh and i got it used in a decent state for le than half the price pre mod', 'greeting from finland i wanted to thank you for this review because it led me to try out the bambino since it wa the best combination of size price and feature for our current need also for anyone that might benefit from this bit of news this particular bambino did come with single wall basket in addition to the dual wall 1 amp 2 cup a of jan 2021 i had read rumour that more recent model were shipping with both and it appears to be the case which is lovely since i do not have to track one down separately perhaps relevant is that this is the sage version of their brand so i am not sure if the breville model ship the same way', 'delonghi dedica ha temperature control low med high did you know that it also ha a thermal block for fast heat it ha programable shot volume and off timer a well a cleaning descale mode you really blew past this one you can get these for under dollar200 may be you should do under dollar200 category the other machine are dollar500 and big really apple and orange if you can not get decent shot from the delonghi you are not trying really a good machine and a value winner in this line up really a good a a siliva no but 2 5 time le expense p the i hit button holding it is a petty complaint you are just clumsy the machine you do not have to hold to install remove portafilter are large and heavy it is by design being small and light not by accident or cheapness', 'hi james where can i buy a 54 mm filterbasket that fit a sage barista express should be same filter size a the bambino i have searched for a better basket without any luck with ims etc do anyone have a link', 'i own the dedica and it is a toy weak extraction and weak steaming do not recommend i got it for size not price if the bambino plus wa available back when i wa buying a machine 2015 i would have gotten that instead', 'one of the worst thing to hear is professional background you mean starbucks with portafilter and dark roast duh if that is professional then leave that behind also i am not sure who are the dumbs always insisting on 25 30 second crap ever since i heard that you can not overextract coffee i just gave up on time and thus reduced lot of frustration in getting nice shot esp that of lighter roast time i have gone up a high a 1 minute 21 second and i always aim for far le than 1 2 and i start my time from the first drop mind that the grind i set is way finer so it may take up to 50 second to see first drop per me ristroto is the best one to go for i have gone a low a 1 0 5 and there is no name for it yet but for super super light roast check your grinder first or else it can spoil it the lowest yield result is best taste and i have cheaper version of delonghi the model you are showing is crap with all automatic timer etc cheaper one is much better just punch a hole in portafilter and you end up with naked one smaller size help because you can have more cup at a time and the infatuation about foam duh btw for delonghi the best flow rate is drip drip drip if it is moving faster then you will not get a good shot and drip drip drip mean no foam sorry instagramers', 'i own the bambino plus and it ha been pretty good to me yes this machine doe not allow for modification other than the size of the shot you can pull but i do like the option of the automatic milk steaming system i do enjoy using it manually and perfecting my milk steaming but the option of it being there for my wife to use who could really care le is great great starter machine that ha built my confidence in hope of one day pulling the trigger on a more legit home brewing setup thanks for the great and honest video james', 'i had free gift card money and went with the bambino i ditched the portafilter and bought a dollar60 wood handled one with a bottomless 54mm basket on amazon i did not have an espresso grinder with finite adjustment and i bought a eureka mignon silencio i am able to pull shot through a naked portafilter without any channeling on the bambino but that is because i have a dollar500 grinder now i like flat white and the auto milk frothing is good enough for me middle setting on heat lowest on froth you are not going to do any latte art with the milk jug that come with the machine unless drawing antartica is considered art what is frustrating is how sensitive the bambino is to grind size you can see on james is grind chart the bambino is by far the coarsest setting compared to the others anything too fine and it will jam the group head an 8th of a turn on the silencio is the entire grind setting range for the bambino there is practically zero adjustment i am just shy of choking the machine to get a double shot 18 8g in 38g out in 28sec and it still taste thin to me any shot programming change with different bean or blending two bean in varying ratio the grinder is still breaking in and i have found the shot programming to be useless to me so far i am ready to ditch the bambino after 2 month it also demand a cleaning cycle every 50 shot manual state 200 but i have had the blinky light twice in two month clean me or i blink cleaning cycle every time i turn on i am only doing 2 shot a day i could see it having a place in a motor home', 'with rancilio i had to revert to the original single shot basket i hate that it is coffee intake volume is highly limited a with ims 58mm double shot basket there wa no way to create an acceptable shot the water flow wa too high even with over pressure valve turned to minimum even with far more finer grinding than you normally get in the coffee house if you know the owner or in roast shop any good hint on why and what basket to use and how much they ev might influence water flow update seems i found a confirmation on the flow grind size diff between ims vst', 'a competition basket ha more uniform hole and generally a le tapered bottom they also have more uniform flow basket to basket these basket are around dollar20 dollar50 vst or ims brand would be a quality upgrade from stock james ha a video on espresso dose and talk a bit about basket gram size', 'hi i wa deciding in between the gaggia new classic the lelit anna and potentially the rancilio a the last option due to the higher price however i have learned today that the gaggia ha an alloy boiler with some coating and that is a massive turnoff for me the advantage of it is that the boiler get hot very quickly due to the alloy body and small size however i am a bit concerned about the material due to potential health risk and would like to avoid having any alloy part in my machine in spite of the coating whilst the coating is on it should be fine but potential galvanic corrosion after year of usage and descaling doe not sound like a good deal to me what do you think should this be a real concern or is it unnecessary nitpicking cheer', 'john gamble pressurized portafilters allow to use coarsely and or unevenly ground coffee and still oull a decent shot of espresso they create the resistance that the coffee can not because it is coarse or uneven if you have an espresso capable grinder get an unpressurized basket and a tamper and you will note the difference in the shot i should say that unless your grinder is espresso capable you should not bother with this you can not use an unpressurized basket with preground coffee you need to grind fresh and with the correct size for this', 'best mod you could do is get an unpressurized portafilter i think dunno the size of the gran gaggia', 'guillaume feugueur let me tell you there is a bias i have owned both of the machine and still own the gaggia classic old model with the good part before they sold to philip and put cheap stuff inside the espresso coming out of both machine a well a the capability to steam milk and create latte art is phenomenal given the size and the price though i am a hobby barista i do not use scale or any fancy stuff to pull my shot the comparison he made is on a too high level i have upgraded to a rocket appartamento thats when thing start to get noticeable better in my opinion since i needed to sell it though i am back at the gaggia classic and believe me it very close to any good coffee shop out there and by far the best option for in home flat white you can get go for the machine you prefer optically or take milk into consideration cause with both you will have to adjust temp surf a little and live with their own special need if your daily drinking habit contain more than 1 2 latte or flat white go for the silvia cause you will save 30 second every time you steam if it is just espresso go for the gaggia i found it easier to control the temp', 'i have a delonghi dedica got ta say the stainless steel version is worth it it heavier than the plastic case based on my impromptu check lifting the box in the store and i found i had a massive improvement when i purchased a bottomless portafilter dollar53 cad from walmart after shipping and tax and turned up my brew temp there is instruction with the machine on how to do so bottomless portafilter better accommodates scale and allows me to ass channeling issue worth every penny and i like that i can set the brew volume i only weigh my shot when i switch to a new coffee bean', 'for the gaggia which vst basket did you use for it they seem to come in gram size and wa it ridged or not', 'i own both the rancilio silvia and the gaggia classic pro the silvia is a tank our un modified version ha been working for almost 15 year without a single problem it is quite sensitive to temperature meaning your shot can be ruined if you do not pull them the second the boiler get up to proper temperature when light turn off but if you are careful and turn off the pump a soon a the light turn on again we get great extraction the gaggia just arrived and i have been frustrated with the low clearance under the portafilter none of my regular sized mug will fit and you can only pull a shot for 5 6 second before the light turn off telling you that the temp ha dropped but a video i saw solved that problem if you click the steam button and leave on for 19 20 second before you pull the shot you get hot water during the entire extraction and the shot are pretty stellar we do not use either machine for steaming milk so i can not comment on that', 'how had i not noticed the size of your hand before', 'loved that you included the grind size for the niche a a reference in this video keep on doing that please', 'where did you find the grind size i feel like an idiot haha', 'mason chamberlain the 9 psi opv spring is relatively easy to replace just need a screwdriver to take the lid off the machine and a spanner of the right size to undo the bolt that hold the current factory spring in and put in the new spring and retighten bolt it make the machine run a little quieter a the pump is not working so hard and i find the shot come out more evenly and gently taste seems more balanced and consistent on the shot a the shot pull at a slightly lower pressure for slightly longer the pid is a lot more work to mod but i also recommend it to get much better temperature control and stability the other easy mod to consider would be the silicone group head gasket a it make inserting and removing the brew basket smoother and easier over the factory rubber gasket that get harder over time and the stainless steel group head mod note some newer machine already come with the steel group head over the earlier aluminum head that wa stock on the earlier machine the steel head is heavier easier to clean and will maintain better brew head temperature stability too good luck', 'i have the delonghi i am still trying to learn how to best use of it

hard so i have added the softener filter i had to descale it twice so far sometimes if i go too fine or i press the coffee powder too much the ulka pump get stuck it becomes very low on noise and it stop creating pressure especially since i did not change the high pressure inlet in the portafilter yet if the pump get stuck i have to pull 2 double espresso shot without the portafilter on so only water come out from the machine then i can use it again a new it is an ok machine i like the coffee with plenty milk so i do not feel too much if the coffee would be too bitter or something for me it

really enjoyed your thought on these machine a someone who is had a bambino for 1 5 year i think you have missed a trick here by using the same recipe for all machine regardless of the portafilter size if you use the same mass of coffee in the basket then a narrower portafilter will result in a thicker puck to hit your extraction time you will have to use a coarser grind and so you will suffer from under extraction if you adjust the mass you use so that your puck is not thicker for 54mm you would want to use 87percent of the coffee you use in a 58mm portafilter you should also adjust time

whole double and single one a part of the package 2 off also mine is the metal chrome one not the black plastic and it certainly doe not look cheap yes it doe lack a bit of mass but the portafilte

the right size and cutting it down however i still could not get satisfactory result and it wa just too inconsistent but in retrospect that could have been down to an issue with my one and possibly that the basket wa not great form size for a small kitchen is very good though not really a milky drink person so can not comment on steaming if space and budget are limited it is not bad but would

pull shot in any strength you want to set it to best result will come from a medium dark roast coffee some medium to light roast will be harder to work with and will not extract a nicely i would

is my personal favourite between the two a it seems to be capable of reaching a finer grind size for stronger espresso shot this is especially useful for milk based drink or straight espresso the dinamica machine have better tasting long coffee and also have a very well executed iced coffee function some of the newer dinamica machine the dinamica lattecrema and dinamica plus have better programability for user presets and advanced milk drink customization in the end it is up to personal preference liam', 'espresso shot are easy with a one button push on the top interface you can select either isingle shot or wouldouble shot and program the dosage i would personally recommend starting at the 5 setting on the grinder and adjust the grind size to taste grind size largely depends on the coffee being used coarser grind le bitter more sour finer grind more bitter le sour each coffee ha a isweet spot but fairly easy to reach with a super automatic machine that is built to improve shot consistency liam', 'the eletta can go to a finer grind size which is better for espresso shot and milk based beverage it also ha an active cup warmer which can make a big difference in beverage temperature the dinamica ha better customization more drink and a really good iced coffee function in the end it is up to personal preference but i would personally choose the eletta just based on the grind option liam', 'the eletta can reach a much finer grind size and ha an active cup warmer for hotter beverage overall the result will be better on the eletta', 'hi i am a newbie on super automatic

'hello this probably the best review for this machine on youtube and it made me purchase the eletta since it had so many feature and make many kind of drink with one touch however i receive it last week and i feel i got a faulty machine the one touch for cappuccino and latte macchiato is making the same exact coffee size and foam even if i set the froth dial at the middle position for latte macchiato i still get the same size foam and flavor i am aware that you can customize the quantity of milk and coffee but that defeat it purpose for being a fully automatic with presets another issue is that when making flat white or caffelatte the machine will overflow my largest cup which is about 400 ml also the froth foam for flat white is twice larger than a cappuccino foam even if i set the dial to the middle position btw i did the reset twice from the menu but still same issue however all other drink like espresso double espresso and long coffee are working fine do you think i should get a replacement since i still got 3 week left of the return window thank you', 'thearmybrat23 i have the same issue i can not adjuste the cup size i can not have small or big size cappucino or latte

about 14 second for a short size is this normal or is this low i wa told around 25 second is ideal i am not sure how to change this to longer i have set the grinder to the finest no 1 would you know thanks so much', 'hi calico thanks for the question you can program the long coffee for higher volume if you like it strong you may want to program for a smaller volume and brew 2 into a single cup be aware spout clearance on the eletta is 5 5 so a tight fit for taller mug cup marc', 'hi that temperature seems on the low side so a few question what size regular coffee are you making and what type of cup are you using the machine is cup warming feature cold cup especially thick ceramic will quickly cool coffee by a much a 20 degree depending on ambient condition in most case these machine brew internally at 195 200f a coffee flow thru the machine it cool some but most machine should deliver coffee coming out the spout in 170 range scale buildup in the thermoblock boiler can effect heating performance over time so critical to stay on top of descaling maintenance', 'hi thanks for your comment here is a side by side spec comparison of those machine some thought on them the breville us a smaller pf at 54mm while the classic ha commercial standard heavyweight 58mm with the classic you will of course want a grinder a well interestingly we like the breville smart grinder pro a an economical companion to the classic you will probably be able to pull better shot with a separate grinder the 16 grind setting on the baristas built in grinder can be limiting like other breville product the sgp is considered by some a more of an appliance a opposed to a machine but should be fine for le demanding home use the classic is machine grade v the b barista appliance the classic is user serviceable if you are so inclined we generally do not recommend breville owner go inside the case another big difference is steaming it is autofrothing on the classic and commercial style manual on the breville it is tough to get a latte art capable microfoam with an autofrothing wand but the breville is not exactly a steaming powerhouse when compared to prosumer level hx and db machine both machine are single boiler sbdu so there is waiting for steam with both and manual cooling down required on the classic after steaming but we prefer the classic is boiler which contains a volume of water over the breville is thermocoil which is an on demand system with some practice and proper use the classic probably ha better temperature stability in the end the classic should produce better espresso when paired with a good grinder and user skill the breville doe okay but trade off some potential quality for ease of use hope that help let u know if you have any more question', 'hi pete it can do 2 double back to back no problem you do have other option like the low pressure pulse brewed long coffee or you can program an espresso to deliver more liquid volume which you prefer is up to your taste preference we do advise when pulling more volume with espresso process brewing that you adjust the grind coarser to avoid over extraction you will definitely save time and money over dollarbucks depending on the coffee you use a double espresso run about 20 cent in bean', 'ah good question both of these model are extremely similar and each have their own advantage so it will depend on your personal preference reason to buy the dinamica lattecrema ecam35075si ice coffee function more customization and fine tuning for various beverage reason to buy the eletta cappuccino top ecam45760s much hotter and programable cup warmer with a dedicated heating element larger bean hopper and water reservoir two frothing system fully automatic lattecrema system or manual frothing wand we would recommend the eletta ecam45760s for the size of the water reservoir and having the option for the manual frothing wand', 'pliaga22 machine is amazing but not great at making large sized latte

silvia steam wand and the portafilter with a better one are these modification possible and what size is the portafilter', 'hi k thanks for the question this delonghi is what i consider and entry level appliance grade product while you could make modification understand it is a pressurized filter basket espresso maker that limit potential quality might be better to consider an entry level machine grade product with commercial size weight non pressurized portafilter and commercial wand like the gaggia classic pro marc', 'hi daniel the icona us a pressurized filter basket these do not produce at the same level a standard non pressurized filter basket crema from a pressurized basket is faked to some extent a liquid from the extraction is squeezed through a single tiny hole bubble pseudo crema form on the other side of the restriction do to release of pressure it is very different than crema formed in non pressurized filter basket which ha hundred of hole and it is the grind size of the coffee causing pressure to build during an extraction that said you may improve espresso and crema by using a different coffee or working with grind size if you are grinding whole bean fresh for brewing if lacking crema in your extraction and you have the option try grinding your coffee finers also use a coffee that is a known easy crema producer italian style bean blend which contain some robusta bean in the mix are good at that hope that help marc', 'hi thanks for the question delonghi list the pf size a 49mm the icona doe have a built in tamper i will also advise tamping is not critical on machine using a pressurized filter basket brewing system like the icona it is more for settling the ground in the filter basket tamping ha little if any affect on extraction with

you have said in a different comment to wingpang66 that the tamper size wa 52mm should we take this thread a the truth of the matter then', 'f scarecro none i can really think of it is an entry level machine designed to work with the pressurized basket for making espresso from pre ground coffee or ese pod will definitely void the warranty if hacked to work like an non pressurized basket you will definitely need a grinder grind size is critical when using standard filter basket also understand this machine us an undersized portafilter it is much smaller than a standard 58mm commercial one with le mass so lower temperature stability could you hack it and make an okay shot once in awhile maybe but espresso is a game of controlling variable and this machine is not really up to controlling those variable beyond using it a equipped you would be better off with a machine like the gaggia classic it come with both pressurized and non pressurized basket ha standard size and weight portafilter an actual boiler a opposed to a thermoblock and large group head for thermal stability it is a little more money but it is a machine built for year of service not an appliance you can see it in action and learn more about why we think it is the best value in a solid entry level espresso machine', 'oytun oral main difference is size not all machine that do 15bar are the same in fact 15 bar is just marketing talk espresso generally brewed at 9 bar 15 bar is just what pump are capable of quality of bean is most important factor then grind then machine', 'whole latte love thanks for your explanation i will get a manual grinder old style i live in turkey and we are not enthusiastic about espresso too much gaggia is not sold unfortunately in turkey unless i am abroad i can not have it anyhow there is almost 60 dollar difference between eco 311 and dedica doe this difference really worth to buy dedica can i get acceptable flavour with enough cream thickness with eco 311 or should i certainly get dedica a i know both machine have 15 bar pressure what is the main difference other than the size additionally can we say the quality of coffee is more important than the machine under 200dollar or can we say that all espresso machine which have 15 bar pressure make the same quality of espresso', 'oytun oral dedica can do two cup just not 2 big cup it seems however your real concern is more crema all machine you mention should produce similar amount of crema if using the same coffee i put crema in quote a these machine all use a pressurized filter basket depending on who you ask the crema produced with pressurized basket is a little different than crema produced in a non pressurized basket where it is the grind tamp of the coffee which creates the brewing pressure for some that difference is not a big deal for other those at the espresso geek level it is a total deal breaker if honest crema is what you are after i suggest a machine with a standard size weight portafilter and regular non pressurized filter basket these require grinding before use so a grinder many lower cost gaggia machine come with standard size pfs and both pressurized and non pressurized filter basket with those you can start without a grinder and move up to non pressurized brewing if when you pruchase a grinder here are two gaggia machine you might consider gaggia classic gaggia

shot look ordinary and there wa not much crema i have tried different grind the crema is usually a similar level i do not feel that it is very clear in the video a the cup is really too big and the coffee get sloshed about a lot i did not realise until this video became so popular how important crema wa i have since invested in some espresso cup and photographed the crema here 0 doe the heater element on top of the machine work or effective i do not usually use the warming plate on top a i keep the milk jug up there i gave it a try today the cup are not very warm after sitting on it for 10 minute the base of the cup is 26c after 30 minute it is 29c i used the milk thermometer to measure that a it is the only thermometer that i had to hand so it may not be the most accurate reading how many cup can you sit on top of it doe not look like many at all 6 espresso cup will fit on top how long doe it take to convert to frothing 40 second you said how long the frothing take how much milk wa that for i did not measure it in the video but have gone back and measured the volume of each latte cup which 260ml so it would estimate it wa around 360ml of milk that i steamed in the video is the frother any good compared to others that you may have used i have not used any others i do really like this one but you are not the only one to mention the bubble how easy is it to clean the frothing wand i feel a though that did not a very good job at all the milk should look smooth and not bubbly it is easy to clean both the removable part are plastic and twist off easily i always clean them straight away by rinsing them in hot water soapy i feel that even if the milk dried you could leave them to soak before cleaning them can it do hot water if so how long doe it take to give you a cup is it hot enough yes you can do just hot water although it doe not come out very fast it take 1 minute to fill up a 275 ml cup and it is 71c i hope this help i will try and add more of these

different option just a different ratio of coffee and milk', 'hi mate yeah it would be a lot easier if they set the cup size correct from the start would not it like you say the different cup size are ratio of milk to coffee but also supposed to be different froth level too think nespresso recommend using the lowest froth level for cappuccino and highest for latte macchiato i would also be using the lowest level for a latte but would like an even lower froth level for the latte myself for a cappuccino 1 shot 40ml according to nespresso 100 ml of milk seems to work when using an aeroccino and barista recipe maker and the nespresso cappuccino cup are 180ml if that help to gauge thing a bit the latte latte macchiato recipe glass are 350 ml suppose trial and error and finding what taste best

leave the cup underneath it for an extra 10 second to let it finish when you wa making the drink with a glass of that shape i thjnk it would of been worth moving the higher drip tray off completely

worry much about the fineness of grind or tamping the grind setting should be like the table salt grain no tamping is necessary the valve inside the portafilter prevents flow of water through for 4 to 5 second allowing the extraction pressure to build to the required 9 bar the 4 to 5 second delay allows the coffee ground to be soaked and swell allowing water to dissolve essential aromatic element in the coffee before extraction a the valve open up at 9 bar pressure the coffee extract drip into the cup a a classic shot of espresso if the quantity of extract is limited to 2 oz it will not be

worth the space saving and the price 3 am i crazy or bean from the same bag really do need grind adjustment a they lose freshness i already suspect my 40 grind setting too cheap to be true grinder but

difficult to learn what effect a certain change like smaller coarser grind size ha on the final result if you want nice coffee on a budget i would look more towards pour over with a plastic hario v60 a nice grinder with available part like a baratza virtuoso and a gooseneck temp controlled kettle going 2nd hand on the grinder might also be worthwhile a long a part are available you can probably find them just over half the new price a a result they might need a new plastic gear or new burr but it can save you a lot of money if you are willing to learn how to fix them if you do really want espresso then it depends whether you need milk a dual boiler are way nicer for steaming or not and how long you want it to last i recently found a second hand expobar brewtus 4 pid that wa basically new and it work great i did consider going with a breville sage dual boiler but like most machine made with that much plastic part it doe tend to fail after a couple of year from what i wa able to gather at the home barista com forum lot of info there really worth reading through some of it you can expect it to last at least 3 year maybe 5 after that it will probably die and you will not really be able to fix it from what i could tell while expobar part seem to not be a readily available a some more luxurious brand like ecm profitec or lelit it wa good enough for me and at 800 euro i thought it wa worth it i hope it will last for a long while and i will just fix it myself i really prefer the idea of just getting something that can last several decade over getting another piece of plastic that i will have to throw out when the first few part break if i had to buy a new one now i would look at something like a profitec pro 300 lelit elizabeth if you want milk or an ecm classika pid if you only need 1 boiler alternatively maybe something like a cafelat robot would be an option le than half the price i would get the barista version with the pressure gauge at 370 dollar or 425 euro depending on where you live and it will probably outlast any of machine i mentioned above a there is very little to go wrong', 'imo no i have a similar machine with a hand grinder and it is often a struggle i have tried many coffee with it only really worked with one most of my shot ended up being sour or just not coming through if i adjusted the grind size']"

small hole for pressurizing this make it easier to check clogging in the perforated filter and the other part just hold up the part to a light window and you will observe any clogging use a needle a described in the manual to avoid clogging i also place a small round piece of filter paper that i cut out from normal melitta filter to perfectly fit the bottom of the perforated part one melitta filter give me 14 small piece and i cut 4 filter at the same time which is pretty fast and i now have 56 piece to further avoid clogging i weekly clean the filter by putting a 1 3 tsp of baking soda

problem now my espresso is perfect and better than anything i tasted before at any coffee shop now i did many thing such a buying proper grinder non pressurized filter proper coffee and the same tamper he us but before doing all of that i learned one technique that you can try right away and it might just work without all other thing i learned that there must be a space between coffee level and the top screen from where water come out i always thought that coffee should touch that screen and loaded the filter a such that wa a big mistake if you think that you may also load too much try loading le and compress harder test your load lock it into position and remove do you see any scratch on the coffee surface are there any coffee grind on the metal screen of the machine if yes then you are loading too much apparently it is important that water fill the empty space called headroom first and then start sipping through compression is very important press hard and make sure it is levelled watch some video how to press properly these two thing headroom and proper compression should make a big difference adding all other thing i mentioned will elevate it to all new level', 'your machine stopped frothing at around 06 33 because by the time you actually turned the lever handle to the steam position the machine switched back to the espresso shot setting your timing of this wa

until the milk frothing light stop flashing before frothing if that light is flashing it mean it is not ready to froth and you have to wait until it stop flashing and remains lit', 'long time dedica user here here are a couple of tip not mentioned or fully explained in the video 1 absolutely do get the proper non pressurised basket you can get it on amazon or elsewhere either with the whole portafilter or just the basket warning the default delonghi portafilter ha a plastic part inside that prevents inserting a deeper proper non pressurised basket but with a little patience and a hacksaw you can simply cut a centimetre or so from the plastic part to make everything fit so you will be able to continue using the default portafilter p ka the pressurised basket allows you to brew essentially anything but you have very little control over brew time in this video they were quite lucky to get something espresso like in most case you will struggle to square a circle it will either choke or brew too quick or you will get inconsistent random result so definitely get the non pressurised basket 2 the button are programmable just push and keep pressing it for the desired length of time it will then remember how long you pressed it very useful when dialling in new coffee just settle on the right dose and grind size get the time right 25 30 s and next time you will get the same result consistently 3 use darker roast look guy i know we are all fan of the light roasted hipster coffee here but this machine can not extract them properly sorry for the allcaps but this point need stressing i learnt it the hard way so perhaps you will not have to if a specialty coffee roastery in czechia and abroad tell you oh do not worry our espresso roast is perfect for home machine they are lying to you it is still way too light roasted to be extracted well by dedica you see the machine doe not really produce high enough temperature even if you set see the manual the water temp to max i remember reading it only get to about 86 c which is simply too low for proper extraction of what modern roaster call espresso or medium roast what you will get will be intensely sour and unpleasant at least to my palate without sugar on the other hand if you use something more traditional doe not have to be very dark just darker than what most specialty coffee roaster usually offer you will get a quite pleasant traditional espresso thick creamy not too bitter not sour sometimes quite sweet i found that brazilian coffee usually work the best with this machine in short look for more developed roast with low acidity 4 steaming milk the wand ha 2 setting use them you can really produce quite acceptable microfoam if you start with the cappuccino setting get some air in and then switch to hot milk to get that vortex swirling going that produce very fine foam it take a bit of practice but it is not hard watch some video on general tip for milk steaming after you finish clean the wand and then you will have to open the valve again to let off the excess heat steam so that the machine return to the normal coffee brewing setting 5 comandante grinder setting naturally this will depend heavily on the coffee bean and dose you are using i only use non pressurised deeper basket and my dose is usually between 17 19 gram the corresponding comandante c40 setting are usually between 7 10 click finer for darker roast coarser for lighter roast be careful not to choke it machine totally you might rupture the o ring in the grouphead it can be easily replaced but be extra careful not to tear the thread on the screw the bed is made of plastic and it can easily happen a you try to tighten it then it will not hold the shower screen properly and the o ring will keep popping out replacing the plastic part is quite a pain in the as for the non mechanic like me so be aware', 'nice video i already use a bottomless portafilter with this machine and the key is get a good enough grinder i use the sage barista one and the combination is fantastic but i couldnt make decent latte with the existing wand i have now removed the metal rod and by just using the existing rubber tube i can make great latte not need to do the rancillo complicated exchange i may see if i can get a longer rubber tube to make it a little easier but by just using the existing rubber tube is a game changer in itself thank you it doe go to show how capable this machine is', 'do you grind your own coffee maybe you grinding is too fine so the water doe not pas through a you have seen on the first shot he tried to take and the measure depends on the type of coffee usually dark roast require smaller dos and lighter roast higher dos if you are using the pressurised basket included in the machine that might be a whole other problem', 'this replaced a smaller keurig that i owned for 6 year mybest kitchen i wanted the convenience of the water receptacle and while this unit is much larger than the previous one i am very happy with my purchase the only downside to this larger model is having to move it from under the cabinet to place the pod and refill it i wa able to rectify this by purchasing glide mat for small appliance now it is perfect', 'i had the same problem the hole at the base of the filter wa blocked and i just removed the blocking particle', 'mike sharp i wa using a kg79 that

towards the gaggia and am on the fence for one this is indeed quite the rabbit hole my main issue is that i have had access to a kees van der westen speedster for a while which i absolutely loved the feel and the design of it is heavy all around and also built like a tank and at 50 something kilo it feel about a heavy too it spoiled me rotten problem is the speedster is basically a 10 000 euro built to order commercial machine packaged for the home if you have lot of space that is which i do not and even if i could not for the life of me justify spending that kind of money', 'very happy with my gaggia with the 9 bar spring and better basket also finally found a bottomless portafilter which i am very happy with also the brass brew head an annoyance on mine is that the red light fall down from their location and it is sometimes hard to see the light i have tried securing them with electrical tape but so far it doe not stay well what with the extreme of temperature etc still i love the shot you are right about temperature control being a bit too variable thanks for the review', 'using a bambino plus for half a year already with the smart grinder on the side my advice get a good grinder something that can grind finer than supermarket espresso grind it is the marriage between the grinder and the machine that make up a good coffee if you buy the smart grinder be careful with light roast a they strain the grinder is internals you can fill the hopper full with dark roast but for light roast only grind what you will brew it really kinda closed the deal with u when we realized that two thing became possible at the same time i can play around with espresso and bean and grind she can prepare milk and coffee drink by just pressing a button if you happen to be in the same situation go for the bambino plus', 'i have now had the gaggia classic pro for a few month and would add a few thing to this excellent review milk steaming power is not a problem if you start steaming before the heating element switch off and the light turn on the lack of space beneath the portafilter is a problem but at least if you are in the uk you can now buy a shorter aftermarket drip tray made for this machine here in the u i had my daughter 3d print me one from plan available at no charge online and it work perfectly the opv mod wa very easy and effective the better filter basket wa a big improvement eventually i will probably do the pid mod but result for now are good', 'rancilio silvia v bezzera bz10 i i have had the latter for a couple of year and i am utterly delighted with it i recently bought a silvia to put in my office and l have been utterly underwhelmed a noted by james it is not possible to get consistent brewing temperature and so taste is inconsistent the small tray area and volume mean that there is always a mess on my bench afterwards unless you enjoy tweaking i would spend the extra on a heat exchanger machine like the bz10 it is soo much le fiddly', 'i have a delonghi dedica and it is real the low temperature issue but here some trick to improve espresso quality of light medium roasted coffee run two cycle of water to heat the portafilter and basket push the steam buttom and wait until the machine is ready then turn it off and wait 3 second turn it on again and it is ready to do an espresso but with hotter water the few extra degree are enough to make sweeter espresso if you are using a 18gr basket the preinfusion cycle in the machine is not suitable for that ammount of coffee so the lower part of the puck doe not get wet you could try to run two preinfusion cycle stopping the first one just after it finish and then run the complete cycle after waiting 5 second with that you will avoid channeling of the lower part of the puck', 'thank you for the video i actually have a used red delonghi machine i bought for 30 euro the seller complained his coffee wa not strong enough and switched to mmacchinetta i always wanted the delonghi a it doe not take a lot of space and i generally think it is a beautiful machine with that red color it is by far one of the best looking on the market i grind the coffee using a heavy professional grinder and after a lot of tweaking i found the right lever of grounding and i must say that the coffee quality is not very far from what you will get in high end coffee shop an interesting discovery about grinding coffee the grinder i have had a broken funnel so i had to design and 3d print a new one after some time i realized that the bottom part of the funnel wa apparently too long and wa ground with the coffee is that the secret to my good coffee maybe', 'i own a dedica for almost a year now i wa not hapypy with the steam wand so i removed the outer part and only use the rubber inner part occasionally pressure spike would throw it into the milk but this can be prevented by putting a gardena sealing ring on it which fit perfectly overall i am very happy with it and for some strange reason setting i am happier with it than with the big commercial machine we have in the office a this one make very sour coffee despite 20percent robusta', 'key to gagiga classic for steam is to start 10 sec before light came on you will get pressure all the time and temp will be constant', 'here in canada the silvia is almost twice the price of the gaggia so it is a no brainer and there is a really simple workaround to get more pressure out of the wand you just start 10 second before the light come on i also upgraded to a vst basket and the ims screen which instantly improved the quality of my shot i will upgrade the portafilter at some point a i agree the handle feel cheap i think i am ready to get the opv mod it look easy enough to install it is a great little machine i am very happy with it', 'older video so i would be shocked if no one ha mentioned this but to steam milk with the gaggia you need to turn on the steam button for about 22 second purge and then steam your milk do not wait for the steam light to come on if the steam light come on you have missed your opportunity because the heating element shuts off if you start steaming just before the light come on the heating element continues to do it thing while you steam your milk', 'after watching this i am glad i enjoy my instant every morning so i can get on with my day without a sense of

delonghi but then just use it the way it come out of the box basically you removed part from the machine the plastic insert and replaced part the basket for all we know you ruined the thing', 'with the delonghi you can change temperature in 3 step and the extraction time by keep holding the button i drilled open the pressure hole and also removed the plastic item and i am quite contempt so far with it for the money really good', 'i have a delonghi for several year already initially i had same experience what you mentioned i pressed button acccidently when holding machine but now i have no problem with that in setting it is possible to set higher water temperature this is what i did plus before shot i preheat basket always this machine also ha big advantage that you can put practically any size cup underneath the spout and even bigger if you remove drip tray so in other word i like it delonghi ha best price performance ratio in my opinion', 'year ago i had a krups like the one james

something new and i do not really wantto buy the silvia v6 and kill it destroy and it become inoperable i do not do mod on thing that are too expensive guitar aside', 'i have a confession i sneered at mr hoffman after my first exposure to his channel where he reviewed a gbp300 bean to cup machine from aldi around about that time i had moved from instant coffee to a pod machine and wa enjoying the novelty of all the random flavour option that they offered i had the opportunity to upgrade pretty cheaply to an espresso machine when a friend of mine bought one a part of a return pallet deal from amazon he had bought in an auction house it is a delonghi bean to cup and ha a built in grinder so it is a bean to cup machine it wa effectively a new machine but with one small crack in the water tank which i replaced for gbp20 it is a bit more of a faff than instant or pod coffee but omg the difference really is remarkable i do not think i will ever be a sniffy a james but now i do appreciate that there is more to it than most people realise now i look forward to trying exotic roast and i am enjoying and appreciating coffee more added benefit is that i am generating a regular pile of puck to mix into my compost bin to add a little nitrogen unfortunately the only downside is that i love it so much i can now hear my heart beating all day and i am down to around two hour of sleep a night', 'true the rancilio is a little tricky but for me it is the real deal most of the time once you have figured out the timing for me 20 30 sec after the heating light went off with the rancilio

small footprint so is great if space is limited yes you do have to hold the machine across the top when fitting the basket which mean you can not store anything on the top platform but i have never accidentally pressed any of the button it can also take larger cup when the drip tray is removed you have a flat base with a stainless steel insert it would mean the base would have to be wiped clean each time you use it if like me you only have one or two coffee in the morning that would not be an issue i never use the milk thingy apology james so i can not comment on that', 'supposedly for greater steaming power with the gaggia turn the steam on 10 second before the light come on steam will supposedly last longer and be a bit more powerful', 'steaming with the gaggia a standard is not helped by the very wide range of temperature pressure when the steaming light is on the thermostat open at around 155c when the light come on but then will not close until the temperature ha dropped to around 115c so with the steam light on the temperature can be anything in that range i have added a dual digital thermometer with thermocouple attached to the boiler and the group head to my machine to help me see what is going on i have found i get the best result if i start steaming before the light come on at a boiler temperature of around 130c i then use the switch to maintain the temperature between 135c and 145c while steaming obviously a pid could to do this automatically but my modification cost around gbp20 and is completely reversible so you should be able to keep your warranty on a brand new machine', 'me an american coffee drinker those are really heavy espresso maker', 'also it seems james missed the fact that you can remove lower the drip tray for a bigger cup', 'got my rancilio in 2008 and ha used it daily without problem so the build quality is indeed very good everything from case to boiler and wiring is heavy duty the older model ha slightly different

you do not have to slam it in like a berserker and saying you press any button while holding it is simply not true i do not know how weird you would have to hold it never happened to me than you said you want more space for your cup and you can do that so easily i do not know why you would not mention it the stand can be removed so you have the desired space milk it foam it or not depending on your setting it just work i do not know if this is a reoccurring theme on your channel but i have watched now quite a few of your video and you seem extremely prejudiced towards some machine you can not just say it is good for the money you always have to add something to it for anyone else if your whole life revolves around the perfect molecular density of your beloved espresso and you will not stop talking about it then please buy the best equipment there is but if you just want a good cup of espresso get a few good bean and invest in the delonghi enjoy the product not the god awful

skeptical that any barista i have for across so far will be able to make an espresso for me better than what i could possibly learn to do if i purchased my own machine this is my first video exploring machine and this guy is making me feel good about my decision i knew there wa way more to espresso than i currently knew or that the average baristas where proficient in i do not hear them talking about any of these thing when making my latte lol', 'sure you are not a skilled gaggia user if you steam the milk a little before the ready light turn on the gaggia will do a much better job than your demo', 'a your fancy man comment wa so quick amp awkward so pleased to see you now own it in later vids even saying it with a delightful giggle bringbackdafancy', 'such a power move making eye contact while taking a shot of coffee', 'james i enjoyed your video however it raise the issue that there are different need i will comment on the delonghi dedica in particular thing you missed or understate but i mean no complaint size very good foot print for small counter basket insert no problem with two hand which i find i use even on full size machine water tank easy to remove refill and replace just slide straight down overrun tray it is three part remove the cover then remove the first tray and you have tray that can hold a regular size coffee cup so that my double shot for a cappuccino can go straight into the cup rather than first into a brew cup to be poured into a larger final cup or simply run double shot twice for a regular cup of coffee startup 45 second and you are ready to brew milk you need some practice with all machine with a little practice the delonghi dedicate gave me perfectly creamy milk and very importantly i did not have to use an amount of milk more than just for my regular coffee cup size cappuccino temperature the brew temperature can easily be set separately each for single and double shot raise the temperature to reduces the chance of sourness and bring out acidity dry touch top of tongue basket grind the factory basket i use only the double shot work fine with brand name coffee at a regular espresso grind i am happy with the machine it give me an espresso mine with a shot of cream and some sugar that is 85percent 95percent of most barista bar the pricey model are also not 100percent and seem to need modification like basket and thing to fix temperature and pressure although not 100percent for the price the delonghi dedica is in my opinion very good', 'since you removed the pressurized portafilter basket in the bambino plus what basket you used to replace again sorry', 'hello can someone help me with picking machine we had a de longhi scultura for gbp200 before but have returned co of few issue im looking for something a bit more expensive would say up to gbp350 maybe slightly more expensive if it better upgrade i am hoping to get something with good steaming wand and power previous wa bad and normal basket thank you for all help', 'i just bought the delonghi dedica about a month ago i removed the steaming cap and it really better and used a new basket on the same portafilter the espresso is not what i am looking for but milk drink cortado and flat white are pretty good i like it again for the money it is the best', 'surely always enjoy amp appreciate your channel i have the dedica i am new to the espresso world i think the dedica would be a good start up machine for me until now i am not able to enjoy light medium roast with it dark roast yes', 'james you called it out but i kinda assumed you would overstated the case a little and you had not the steam pressure on the gaggia classic pro is really disappointing i can get by but i hoped for better i had better pressure with modded steamwand dedica actually even with the trick of steaming before the ready light illuminates i can barely sustain a whirlpool not sure if this would be fixed with a single hole steamer tip because two hole seems to work against itself in term of whirling but yeah wish i would gone with the silvia', 'delonghi dedica ha temperature control low med high did you know that it also ha a thermal block for fast heat it ha programable shot volume and off timer a well a cleaning descale mode you really blew past this one you can get these for under dollar200 may be you should do under dollar200 category the other machine are dollar500 and big really apple and orange if you can not get decent shot from the delonghi you are not trying really a good machine and a value winner in this line up really a good a a siliva no but 2 5 time le expense p the i hit button holding it is a petty complaint you are just clumsy the machine you do not have to hold to install remove portafilter are large and heavy it is by design being small and light not by accident or cheapness', 'hey james i wa wondering if you could try the gaggia classic pro milk frothing again but without letting the light turn on start steaming about 5 10 second before the steam light come on and see what kind of time you get', 'great video so enlightening thank thank you thank you', 'one trick when it come to steaming on the gaggia start 4 5 second before the light come on so the heat pressure keep going for longer', 'silvia all the way for me after owning a delonghi and a sage which is more appliance than machine the silvia will be going long after some of the others pack up plus temp surfing with it is easy no pid necessary bring up to temp place a plastic container under the head and draw water through until the heater lamp light again leave until it go out then draw a little of the excess steam and over temp water until the steam hiss disappears this u usually no more than few second insert portafilter and brew your coffee perfect every time with the right grinder i use a mazzer personally', 'one of the worst thing to hear is professional background you mean starbucks with portafilter and dark roast duh if that is professional then leave that behind also i am not sure who are the dumbs always insisting on 25 30 second crap ever since i heard that you can not overextract coffee i just gave up on time and thus reduced lot of frustration in getting nice shot esp that of lighter roast time i have gone up a high a 1 minute 21 second and i always aim for far le than 1 2 and i start my time from the first drop mind that the grind i set is way finer so it may take up to 50 second to see first drop per me ristroto is the best one to go for i have gone a low a 1 0 5 and there is no name for it yet but for super super light roast check your grinder first or else it can spoil it the lowest yield result is best taste and i have cheaper version of delonghi the model you are showing is crap with all automatic timer etc cheaper one is much better just punch a hole in portafilter and you end up with naked one smaller size help because you can have more cup at a time and the infatuation about foam duh btw for delonghi the best flow rate is drip drip drip if it is moving faster then you will not get a good shot and drip drip drip mean no foam sorry instagramers', 'i have a dedica at home i have had the pressurised portafilter basket block which is not ideal to use larger cup you have to remove the drip tray', 'i have the deloghi machine and you can mod the machine with the silva wand that made the milk streaming 100x better or you can remove the outter cage of the panerello wand which work okay besides swapping the portafilter wonder if there are other mod that could make the coffee better', 'i am ever so slightly offended with the comment about the bambino being for someone who doe not want to invest time in their own skill set', 'i am quite disappointed that they did not just add the new feature of the bambino to a slightly updated shell of the infuser i purchased a bambino thinking that it would be an upgrade and in many way such a steaming and heat up time it wa however it is just so small and bounce around the counter it feel like a little toy i would almost consider a barista pro just for the added weight even though i would be using a separate grinder you would still save money over the ranchilio with more consistent shot quality would be interesting to see if the shot quality is the same on the bambino a the barista pro', 'with the gaggia classic pro if you start steaming 10 second before the steam light turn on you can get faster steaming pressure and reach temperature quicker this is because when the light turn on the heating element turn off 10 second before the heating element stay on', 'i have a slightly older model gaggia classic and have a little bit of a trick for the steam if i start steaming right before the the ready light come on kinda have to get a feel for your machine to guess when that will happen i can usually get the thermostat to keep the heating element on through the entirety of the steaming it is usually not a problem for just a single cap but i find it help with avoiding the steam sort of dying out halfway through especially if you are steaming for multiple drink at once', 'hello james i watched this one with interest a i moved from a delonghi to the bambino plus some month ago can i ask where you managed to get a vst 54mm basket from in the uk a i have looked on the net amp do not seem to be able to find one thanks in anticipation neil', 'jameshoffman great video probably saved me a few quid a i wa looking at swapping my silvia v4 for the lelit grace you mentioned lighter roast in this video and how i have and only managed to get sour tasting espresso when using lighter roast is there a video that show how to overcome this a i feel like i am missing out on a whole range of coffee experience thanks again james', 'i had free gift card money and went with the bambino i ditched the portafilter and bought a dollar60 wood handled one with a bottomless 54mm basket on amazon i did not have an espresso grinder with finite adjustment and i bought a eureka mignon silencio i am able to pull shot through a naked portafilter without any channeling on the bambino but that is because i have a dollar500 grinder now i like flat white and the auto milk frothing is good enough for me middle setting on heat lowest on froth you are not going to do any latte art with the milk jug that come with the machine unless drawing antartica is considered art what is frustrating is how sensitive the bambino is to grind size you can see on james is grind chart the bambino is by far the coarsest setting compared to the others anything too fine and it will jam the group head an 8th of a turn on the silencio is the entire grind setting range for the bambino there is practically zero adjustment i am just shy of choking the machine to get a double shot 18 8g in 38g out in 28sec and it still taste thin to me any shot programming change with different bean or blending two bean in varying ratio the grinder is still breaking in and i have found the shot programming to be useless to me so far i am ready to ditch the bambino after 2 month it also demand a cleaning cycle every 50 shot manual state 200 but i have had the blinky light twice in two month clean me or i blink cleaning cycle every time i turn on i am only doing 2 shot a day i could see it having a place in a motor home', 'thanks mr hoffmann my pocketbook is much lighter due to your effort', 'we lived with a gaggia for 10 year rancilio steam wand upgrade and multiple new pump over that item a well a other routine maintenance it wa solid but we have just bought a new machine the bambino plus marketed by breville here in australia we got the stainless body model which look heavier and nicer than the one you tested but it is still lighter than the gaggia we could not be happier with the new machine it is true we are not modders or enthusiast we have 5 min to pump out our coffee in the morning between kid breakfast and ironing shirt for the rushed parent it make a much better coffee than the gaggia once you get the pre infusion setting right love our bambino plus', 'i use the delonghi dedica for 4 year you can vary the temperatur 2 c the pressure is very high up to 15 bar but it need some second to reach it high value so you can lower the effective pressure by stopping and restarting the shot in a series of short periodes about 1 2 sec duration each i use a bottomless portafilter and a non pressurized single basket 10g medium to light roast espresso found no other way to avoid channeling in this setting because of the high pressure maybe easier with a double basket but i do not need so much coffein in the morning i also found the milk steamer difficult to clean i like your video very much thanks a lot', 'i am now using the gaggia new classic for 4 week after delonghi dedica see above and yes james you are totally right it is so much easier to extract evenly with the gaggia compared to the dedica especially the lighter roasted blond quality thank you for your video giving good guidance', 'i have a lelit pl41tem machine i am quite happy with it the only thing i do not like is that a you remove the portafilter you need to hold the left corner of the machine with your left hand and the machine feel like it is warping or sliding on the counter i use the portafilter that came with the machine and it is a heavy one and from chromed brass now that you spoke that you did not like this portafilter i start to get uneasy that i could still get a better portafilter than the one i have which portafilter did you actually recommend i do not see how there is a better portafillter than the one that came with the unit my lelit model ha pid so temperature is great and nice to see the pressure and water level thanks', 'i own a gaggia classic and have used my friend racilio silvia they were both great machine to start learning how to pull espresso shot they were definitely fussy when it came to controlling the temperature and required guestimating the best timing to pull the shot by i e listening to the boiler instead of relying on the indicator light but they were both really capable of pulling great shot at time and were enjoyable to use i did find that cleaning the gaggia classic wa a bit of a fuss since the group head often required to be taken apart to do some good cleaning to get rid of all the old coffee grind i think the two are great entry machine for espresso for anyone looking to start the path of espresso a a hobby it definitely take time to learn the skill finding your favorite bean a well a for all the maintenance but if you are looking to get the reward of getting great coffee at home by paying that extra time those two are a great way to go also i had the same exact experience with the steam on those two machine i wa not very happy with the steam on the gaggia classic but wa impressed by the silvia and this wa back in the early 2000s so i guess those two machine have not changed very much since then', 'i have had the delonghi for nearly 2 year only paid gbp90 and have been really impressed i feel there are a couple of point missed from the review and would have appreciated a comparison between the stock and upgraded basket a i am not convinced by that modification you can remove the drip tray to fit a larger cup latte glass mug and there is a basic flatter drip tray with rubber edge under the tray with the float the steam wand can operate like a traditional one of you just slide the cuff from cappuccino to hot milk you can also change the temperature and pressure in a slightly awkward menu guided by different timed button flash once you set it to your preference however it save those setting so worth an initial play with the setting just feel some of these point counter the criticism raised', 'i use the dedica to brew coffee with chicory it doe a really good job of that it struggle with lighter roast for sure i have not modded it in any way', 'we had a saeco pressurized basket but switched to a silvia 8 year ago had to replace the pump a few month back but we have been happy with it i steam the milk first and then pull the espresso which usually mean the temperature light come on would that indicate the temperature of the espresso is low enough', 'your review did not highlight the problem with gaggia classic is on off switch i bought a new classic replacing one we have used for over 10 year only to find that the power switch wa faulty in a phone conversation an agent from the distributor said they had on going problem with the classic faulty motherboards my machine ha been returned to be fixed we have not heard anything from the company not even an apology we are hugely disappointed i did watch your review before buying perhaps you could warn potential buyer of possible disappointment', 'bought the rancilio a my first espresso machine put the pid kit in it and it served u well for a long time before selling to upgrade slight downside is if you wanting to make two larger flat white you sometimes need to wait for the boiler to reheat for another batch of milk in saying all of that it a beast of a unit and well worth it', 'i pretty much disagree with this video you should have picked the lelit anna 2 you have anna 1 the 2 is way better and still around dollar500 and the steam wand is different on the 2 also without using a naked portafilter on the lelit thats an unfair test a for the rancilio it all ove the place with temp screw temp surfing and ballsing around with that get a machine with a pid like the anna 2 which is slightly le in price the reason you are getting better steam on the rancilio is because it running too hot a for gaggia i think your bias may have come through that machine suck ball no pre infusion no pressure gauge no pid do not tell me to mod it modding is for people who buy a car and realize it did not come with four wheel and they buy a 4th and think they have fixed the issue no just buy a car with 4 wheel duh also the gaggia ha an aluminum boiler which is a known health hazard lelit us brass a do most in the higher end there is a reason why your comment on the gaggia is what make it suck ball you can fix it you should not have to if you have to fix it the manufacturer did an awful job and have failed', 'would you say that spending the money and time installing a pid for the silvia would make it the best budget friendly option or with that added expense doe it move it into another tier with better option', 'the delonghi dedica actually ha temperature control which can be set to low medium high medium being default no mention of actual the temperature it relates to though newer model also feature a removable drip tray that give a bit more clearance for taller cup these two are mentioned a con but seem to be simply overlooked changing the steam pipe for an actual real one is also quite simple and only requires a screwdriver and pipe it will improve steaming significan notly also if you top of a centimeter of the plastic piece that is removed in the video an unpressurized basket will fit without any hassle i actually removed the second bottom of my pressurized basket with a dremel leaving me with a normal basket take a bit of work but if coffee is a hobby for you it can be a fun little project', 'i could not agree more the dedica ha instruction for lowering and rising the temperature in the instructive it also suggests warming up your cup by running hot water on it from the basket which is obviously to also heat up the basket thus aiding with the extraction process speaking of which i actually think that the plastic piece on the basket is key to prevent hot water and hot espresso from touching cold metal since the plastic actually insulates it i feel like when you dismantle the basket and take out the plastic piece then it will lower your espresso temperature playing with the temp setting and also with the grind with different coffee blend ha made my experience with the dedica quite enjoyable for over two year already my rule of thumb is using the low temp setting for dark roast medium for both dark and medium roast and high temp for either lighter roast or for certain more dense and or more acidic coffee another great thing about the dedica is that you can instantly stop the flow by pushing the button again if you push the button and leave it pressed the flow will continue until you release and the machine will remember that setting i e very basic but you can program it', 'gaggia you have got to temp surf the steaming too after i have pulled a shot i switch to steam then turn the wand on a the temperature build once it is giving out a good amount of steam but the light indicating it is 100 degs and heating element turn off ha not come on yet i start steaming and finish the milk ideally before that light come on that way you start at a good steaming temperature but the heating element remains on throughout the steam and your pressure doe not nosedive halfway through', 'i would give it to the bambino i have gone from moka pot stove top steamer la pavoni europicola stove top steamer rancillio silvia sage bambino plus sage barista express i would give it to the bambino the silvia requires too much faff with temperature surfing the steaming power is good but you have to purge load or water and wait like 1min for it to reach steam pressure and you have to make sure you start steaming before the thermostat click off otherwise the steaming run out before it click back in the tank is annoying to remove the brew temp is not very stable it doe not auto switch off i have left it on all day so many time and eventually killed the boiler a the cut off switch failed the bambino is just great it turn on really fast the steam is pretty much instant and powerful the brew temp is stable the steam wand auto purge which is just great for this reason i am keeping this over the barista express it tell you when to clean it it ha a water level low cut off sensor which prevents you from trying to pull a shot on an empty tank sage really have thought about nearly everything with this machine the main issue are the small drip tray lack of weight so you have to hold it down when putting in the portafilter lack of seal sound damper on water tank lid and drip tray so it make an annoying rattling sound and a poor connection from the solenoid valve to the drip tray so water always splash underneath the tray i have had far more consistent result with the bambino from day 1 than i ever got with the silvia after owning it for a few year maybe in theory the silvia could give better result with a fancy pant vst basket but otherwise it really annoying to use because of all the other problem and i am pretty sure not having consistent temperature negates the benefit of a vst basket and the smaller 54mm portafilter are also le prone to channelling so are more forgiving i really do not want to be temperature surfing at 7am in the morning it is bad enough dialing in the grinder at that time silvia wa great a few year back when finding a home espresso machine with good steam power wa difficult and easier than a stove top steamer but sage ha really pushed the technology forward with the thermojet system and the silvia is feeling dated considering you can pick up 2nd hand bambino on ebay for gbp170 it really is the best machine under gbp500', 'hi i have the dedica delonghi for almost 2 year the price quality ratio function wa the best i found here in chile i am delighted i use it daily', 'my gf ha got one too i bought unpressurized basket for it it is ok i have to grind coarser than it should be and the espresso quality is slightly different almost every time do you pre heat yours with a couple of dry run to get the best temperature', 'doe make me wonder how much would one have to spend to get a fairly decent machine that is nice to use and doe not require heavy modding trying to get a bit of an idea how much to save up', 'i own both the rancilio silvia and the gaggia classic pro the silvia is a tank our un modified version ha been working for almost 15 year without a single problem it is quite sensitive to temperature meaning your shot can be ruined if you do not pull them the second the boiler get up to proper temperature when light turn off but if you are careful and turn off the pump a soon a the light turn on again we get great extraction the gaggia just arrived and i have been frustrated with the low clearance under the portafilter none of my regular sized mug will fit and you can only pull a shot for 5 6 second before the light turn off telling you that the temp ha dropped but a video i saw solved that problem if you click the steam button and leave on for 19 20 second before you pull the shot you get hot water during the entire extraction and the shot are pretty stellar we do not use either machine for steaming milk so i can not comment on that', 'wow this video is exactly what i needed i have been using the dedica for 4 year now purchased for le than dollar200 cad the review here is spot on uphill battle with light roast which is why in my video on my channel i showed a light roast in the background but usually use medium roast the machine need lot of helping to get an okay shot it wa my first machine to learn the variable of espresso and making milk drink before investing into a better machine i like the rancilio v6 but for once in my life i do not feel like modding the machine having needed to do this on dedica and wrestling with consistent result therefore i think the lelit anna 2 with pid with a better basket is my next machine i will need a larger kitchen for anything else hah ha i just wish the cost in canada would be cheaper a it is close to dollar900 cad v a converted dollar350 pound to dollar600 cad', 'after watching this video i really feel like the delonghi dedica give the same result a my dollar100 usd delonghi stilosa doe i mainly use it for milk drink and i hate how frothy the milk get with the attachment plain espresso shot with light roast coffee taste great and i never drink coffee black', 'i felt i needed to say this these are mostly over priced machine there used to be no need to buy a 500 pound mammoth not so long ago in spain we have a not so well known espresso tradition aswell if you ask for a coffee it will be an espresso for 1 3 euro i have been drinking preground espresso kept in a good container in the fridge not a a hobby but a the way we did this in household since always now i moved to the uk and tried to find the great saeco aroma stainless steel boiler to be disappointed it wa bought by philip and discontinued they are pushing graggia now with an shitty aluminium boiler now i find myself having to pay for a grinder not easy to find packet of pre ground espresso here and an overpriced espresso machine because it is become trendy in northern european and american country this should not be an expensive hobby but an affordable accesible daily way to have your cup of coffee if you wanted to besides a rant this is a futile attempt to tell everyone espresso is not rocket science i think it is taken waaay too seriously and definitely no one would call it a hobby down south consequence of this is a lot of snake oil and overpriced machinery yes it is s rant', 'recently bought the breville infuser after considering the bambino ha a pressure gage and it bigger heavier so it doe not move a much bought a fancy aftermarket naked portafilter to start delving deeper into the hobby with the single walled basket love it so far and have learned a lot from your vids', 'would it be effective and cheap to add a few lever action suction cup to the bottom of these lighter machine', 'great video james a always just one thing re steam and the classic what i have found with the original classic and i have found the same to be the case with the new pro 2019 is that if you start steaming before the steam ready light come on you have more steam power here', 'interesting that the delonghi you have wa so different from mine i just recently purchased mine is stainless steel which compared to others i have used give it a slight increase in weight which allows me to remove the portafilter one handed provided the bottom is griping the benchtop properly also the removable drip tray ha a nice i assume stainless steel cover underneath so that mug and larger cup do not just sit in the plastic bottom which is a nice feature to be included just found it interesting that there were some difference that may or may not have caused a different opinion of it edit by the way after just an hour or so about going through the setting setting the water temp etc i think the difference between the stock shot i wa pulling and what i am able to pull now especially considering the change in coffee i have used is night and day', 'mason chamberlain the 9 psi opv spring is relatively easy to replace just need a screwdriver to take the lid off the machine and a spanner of the right size to undo the bolt that hold the current factory spring in and put in the new spring and retighten bolt it make the machine run a little quieter a the pump is not working so hard and i find the shot come out more evenly and gently taste seems more balanced and consistent on the shot a the shot pull at a slightly lower pressure for slightly longer the pid is a lot more work to mod but i also recommend it to get much better temperature control and stability the other easy mod to consider would be the silicone group head gasket a it make inserting and removing the brew basket smoother and easier over the factory rubber gasket that get harder over time and the stainless steel group head mod note some newer machine already come with the steel group head over the earlier aluminum head that wa stock on the earlier machine the steel head is heavier easier to clean and will maintain better brew head temperature stability too good luck', 'same setup same reason same experience here i can add to this ensure your machine is nice and hot even though it show to be ready after 5min give her the 20min like normal thermoblock machine with the steam i have the impression that the machine doe not continue to heat after you take out steam until the light go off this could also be the reason why the trick with taking steam out before the light come on might work and i do have the impression it doe work even though not scientifically tested note however that i only make small milk portion since only one of the coffee need it', 'i have the delonghi i am still trying to learn how to best use of it but related to cup size that fit you can remove the lower shelf than you can fit bigger mug easily', 'dear james since you moved to the new studio setup i find the video sound quite unpleasant sound like some kind of comb filter effect due to the environment probably ease to fix with a couple of diy acoustic panel the sound until about three week ago wa much nicer', 'i have a gaggia coffee not the classic i could pull a good shot in that baby and it would do a very good job steaming milk mind you that wa a mod i wa going to do a major mod it i wa getting irritated buying 50 cent part for dollar20 by building my own wifi enabled pid i am a old time computer hacker starting in the mid 70 and i am getting into small wifi computer system like raspberry pi i wa thinking of the 0w for this project and of late i have been messing around with arduino controller unfortunately i set it on fire and thankfully only scorched the cabinet but my fire extinguisher finally got a good use if i wa going to buy one of those i would go for the rancilio silvia brass boiler and all and add a of the shelf pid i have two la pavoni crossroad single head model they are heavy the wiring is a bit of a nightmare but i found someone who documented how to program them a computer would be easier i tested the best looking of the pair and it doe not work i have tinkered with it a wee bit and i am going to have to move the cannibalised part back to the other machine before i can test that one it is disappointing that i can not access a manual for either of them though i have heard of a crazy genius repairman in vancouver help i really enjoy your coffee fanaticism and i am going to have to up my game one of my friend is a coffee roaster frog friendly wild just down the road from me and he is a wee bit of a coffee fanatic a well so i told him about you', 'i have the bambino plus personally and i am quite happy with it i did do a slight mod to mine i found a company that make customized bottomless portafilters combined with a non pressurized basket i get some pretty great shot out of the machine i like how quickly it heat up and it is awesome to have an automated milk frothing system that doe not suck of course it is better to froth manually but in those time when i am in a rush it is a great feature', 'another great video i have the older gaggia baby class which i think is no longer made b c the cheap paint job keep peeling which is a great machine would you consider doing a video on modding the gaggia rancilio i temp surf by pulling out about 6 sec of water until the ready light go off then wait until it go on again then press the steam button for 5 sec to get a little more heat and then immediately pull the shot for consistent temp what would you do to mod it and how much would that improve the shot', 'james you are amazing i have the delonghi dedica upgraded with a non pressurised basket and a naked portafilter you can chose between 3 step of temperature by the way i can get quite decent dark roasted espresso but i struggle with lighter roasted one now i can confirm my assumption too much pressure not built for non pressurised basket i can not wait to see a video of the best espresso machine for hobbyist baristas thank you', 'a note to the dedica part i have the scultura ecz 351 which is very very similar to dedica literally just a different design with the same part inside even the basket are the same and i had it modified to my need a naked portafilter solved the three hole problem i also installed an ims la pavoni basket the 51mm one i evened the edge to fit because it is curvy i agree none of these delinghis are warm enough barely 70c it is ok i guess but a pid would be neccessary with light roast it is indeed real pain to use i tend to use medium roast with it bottom line is with a better basket it is usable but at this price point i would also suggest to save up for a better machine', 'i bought the delonghi dedica a couple of month back and it is been a bit of a mixed bag to be honest i bought a non pressurized basket which ha made a bit of a difference compared to the pressurized it is also meant i can grind a bit finer a the pressurized really struggle with a fine ground and just clog up there is three temperature setting and found the hottest one to be the most effective a the standard temperature that is programmed is just a bit too cool for me for the milk steaming i removed the silver wand and just use the rubber wand underneath though have had to use a cable tie to keep that in place a otherwise it pop off that is made a world of difference to the milk texture though overall i am pretty happy with the machine and the price i paid for it a in this instance you do get what you pay for it is been a good starter machine but i will be upgrading a and when budget and counter space oh and wife allows', 'thanks to james i did take the plunge in a new hobby and habit after a lot of research wound up with the breville in u s bambino after investing in a good grinder sette 270wi i do think i can better my skill and move to full manual mode rather than the automated setting which you can also adjust i do tend to feel like shot come out a little sour and my fix to that is to start the clock after first drip not upon hitting start or preinfusion so about 8 9 second on preinfusion 10 second to first drop and if i can dial into 2 1 at somewhere around 33 36 second i feel like i have moved the bar to a more balanced shot i read and watch many conflicting opinion about this but that is what i have found so far wonder what james would say about this the only thing i can not seem to control is shot temperature i am going to guess it is on the cooler side even after trying to warm up the basket i steam the milk at the second setting which warms up a latte or cappuccino to a longer lasting adequate temp the milk steaming is fantastic in my opinion so i m satisfied with this little device and the space saving is also another advantage cheer', 'in my country for 829 gbp cca you can buy super modded rancilio silvia e which is two temp sensor one in brew head one in boiler it ha two user profile can regulate pump power preinfusion ha lcd which display clock time of extraction can wake up in certain time or go to sleep also ha pressure gauge and water sensor for low water in reservoir and little led light when you can not see your coffee well yet d bit expensive but also keep warranty and no need to mess with modding also noticed that company which sell them sell ascaso dream which i never saw before look very interesting and review wouldnt be bad i guess promising piece imho at least spec wise', 'i picked up the sage bambino in the curry is new year sale where it wa 50percent off down to gbp199 replacing the delonghi in this test it is light year better for me although it can take a while to dial in the grind to get a good flow and rate also interesting is mine came with both pressurised and non pressurised filter i read they had changed to including the non pressurised one late last year so maybe they changed back i also picked up a naked 54mm portafilter for it from a certain cheap chinese website for gbp25 which really helped me get good shot from it though i am interested in what basket you bought is there a good 54mm basket you would recommend', 'i found with my gaggia that i get the best milk when i start frothing before the light come on and i can really draw out the heating setting it give me more power and a faster froth i have a heavily modified old model classic though not the new pro model', 'great video james a always can you please elaborate a little more on this issue of too much pressure too high brew temp on this sort of machine i use an hx machine from sab which is not exactly in the price range you are talking about but i think i experience the same problem despite using vst basket good water weighing shot paying attention to distribution etc it is extremely hard to get lighter roast shine a good a they do at my local specialty coffee shop with real pro machine dark and medium roast are fine will it help if i set the pressure to 8 instead of 9 bar', 'hi james just some input on your new studio setting i feel you are using a way too short depth of field and what happens is a your camera is focused on the machine and a you are behind it it make you slightly out of focus lacking sharpness and giving the idea that the video quality is not so good specially considering the we usually look more at you than at the machine a your hair is so perfect try adjusting your aperture specially on the genus wide shot you can play more with the aperture on the close up shot look nice also i fell that the colour are lacking some vibrance or maybe it is just too cold anyway that is just my feeling other than that your video are amazing a usual thanks', 'i have a bambino plus that wa gifted to me at first i really enjoyed the ease of getting an okay milk based drink then i upgraded my grinder then i upgraded the basket milked based drink went from okay to wonderful then i stopped drinking milk based drink and started drinking strictly espresso then i moved from darker roast to lighter roast i am grateful for my bambino and will use and learn a much a i can about espresso but i have learned i do like to tinker i do like to work hard at honing a craft and i do see the bambino is limitation i am looking forward to future upgrade just down that espresso rabbit hole over there', 'i wonder if i just missed something but did he explain why the sage bambino struggled with lighter roast', 'he did not but other youtube video have suggested the water temp is a bit low apparently the pid is set at 200f 93c which can be a bit low for lighter roast james doe explain the link between water temp and roast in another video about brew temperature', '13 27 the lelit actually also got a solenoid valve but the release is hidden inside the case if you remove the drip tray straight after a shot it sometimes still drip on to the metal there', 'i have the gaggia classic pro and to have a good pressure to steam the milk i need to wait for the red light to turn on and go off twice', 'i once owned the delonghi and i experienced the same problem with it is shot you did with light roast the shot always came out sour and harsh and we are not really enjoyable now i updated my setup and own a niche zero amp a rocket mozzafiato type v and interestingly my grindsettings are mid to end 10 for really nice short of dark and light bean so far away from 25 to 28 doe someone have similar experience with the niche and machine in this price range', 'hey james could we please turn auto caption on a a deaf person i find it very difficult to watch video without caption even if they are slightly off inaccurate', 'it take around 45 second for gaggia to get up to full steam power that is when the steam light turn on if you start steaming at around 40 second the light will not be on and so you get steady steam power', 'i own a dedica and everything james said about it is true milk frothing is really inconsistent the wand is very unorthodox especially if you froth with a standard steaming wand and not a panarello one with the dedica espresso is questionable too very inconsistent light roast are a nightmare indeed and a someone who enjoys really light roasted coffee you get alot of acidity with the dedica although for a starting machine it will get your foot on the door of espresso machine ive had surprisingly good milk froth good tasting medium to dark roasted coffee and a neutral over all experience the dedica isnt that bad but it also not good for the price it really meant for you to get into the world of latte art and espresso making but it not the machine you would have in a cafe or small coffee shop hope this help', 'i had the dedica and had the same experience a you i moved to a flair and have not looked back', 'i have a slightly more expensive full metal version of the delonghi and i love it granted i am not much of a coffee connoisseur it is saved me so much money from having to go into coffee shop in the long run never had to hold it down', 'james great review of each machine i have a gaggia and found the steam to be weak when i got it i would recommend turning the steam switch on and start steaming milk 20 25 second after doing so this way the boiler remains on the entire time you are steaming rather than waiting for the light to turn on before starting it work much better', 'whole latte love ha a video about this technique they turn it on 10 second before the light come on and get a huge boost i steam very small quantity of milk so i have not needed to try it', 'i removed the air incorporating attachment from the steamer on my delonghi and it went a long way to improving the milk texture that attachment is really frustrating if you want a bit more control over the milk', 'great video james a always i wonder if you can go finer with the bambino by decreasing the dose to compensate would that potentially work with the light roast', 'very nice round up and a good and fair comparison i have had the lelit for about 4 year now it is my first espresso machine and i have enjoyed using it thanks to your video i have definitely stepped up my game over the last year or so and i can make pretty good espresso with it but i also recognize it is flaw i also do not like the water tank and drip tray and i find the non standard size of the portafilter to be slightly frustrating a it is harder to find accessory for it but all in all i think it is a good value for money and a nice machine to start learning how to make proper espresso', 'the bambino here in new zealand is breville rather than sage and only come with the dual wall pressurised basket unless you want to buy pre ground coffee you should 100percent get standard basket here you can buy them directly from breville for approx dollar12 other than the machine being so light and moving around when locking in the portafilter i have loved using it it wa my first espresso machine so i have learned a lot with it but once i ha the standard basket decent bean and got the hang of dialling my shot i wa very impressed with the coffee i could get from it a james said it wa a good machine to learn manual steaming on but the automatic steaming also make it easy enough for visitor to use my young niece love making their own hot chocolate like the one at the cafe another bonus is how quickly it is ready to go literally second and thr water is up to temp unfortunately my bambino died a couple of month ago after having it for le than 1 year due to a disagreement between the service agent and the ship from where i bought it basically over 6 week since it went to them for repair and it had not been touched i got a full refund they had none in stock to replace it and doe not look like they are getting more in any time a their system said the line is finished i have found a couple of chain store still selling them online but they also no longer have them in store i am currently torn whether to get another one or go for something like the sylvia but that is twice the price of the bambino here dollar1300 to dollar1500 v dollar580 to dollar750 respectively which put the breville the infuser in between them in price but closer to the bambino however it look like you then lose the automatic milk frothing while keeping the pre infusion with the infuser but the le then great look or build quality that you get with thre sylvia', 'important to note with the silvia is that the unstable boiler temperature also effect the milk steaming in my experience you basically have to start steaming milk immediately after the light switch off to get that powerful steaming however if you wait just a 30 second 1 minute it get considerably weaker and you have to steam for a lot longer', 'regarding the basic delonghi modification i also upgraded my first espresso machine an entry level delonghi with a non pressurized basket instead of the standard pressurized standard item and i had to remove that same plastic insert but after a number of messy shot my penny dropped you can just insert a stainless steel screw into the superfluous screw hole no more mess but i would pick my cafelat robot and a cafeti re for the occasional plant based milk frothing over any of these machine any day', 'i have a slightly urgent question so if you have a chance to get back quickly or if anyone else on here ha an opinion on this please get back to me asap which would you recommend between the breville barista pro the breville barista touch or one of these shown in this video hope to hear back from you guy soon thx for the advice anyone', 'watched this with interest a it ha the one i own and the one i wa considering upgrading to i purchased a dedica 680 about year ago slightly used for dollar100 this wa an experiment to see if i could save some money because my wife love her vanilla latte with almond milk iced at dollar5 to purchase those she could make a quad shot and be done at a fraction of the cost it work quite well for her she is not a snob just want to push a couple of button and have it happen for her yes it is only a 51mm portafilter which is frustrating the temperature is adjustable i tend to use darker roasted bean i have experimented with the 3 setting and found the one that work for me i have a decent grinder but not sure it would cut it with an unpressurized machine but it is what i have had and it work great for making regular coffee from either my technivorm or breville precision brewer i like taking something that will last me a while at work i do make latte with the dedica but learned early on to take off the panarello wand portion and just use the rubber portion it make it shorter so it is sometimes hard with certain pitcher getting it low enough but i can get decent milk texture from it now creating latte art that is the fault of the artist for dollar100 money well spent a an experiment my worry is that the unit i wa hoping to purchase the gaggia classic pro seemed to have some issue a well i understand modding an inexpensive machine like the dedica but it seems that the piece that you talk about modding not including a pid should be done right the first time at the factory for no increase in cost i do like it that it doe come with a pressurized basket so i have a backup plan if my grinder doe not grind fine enough and can start setting aside some fund to upgrade so even though my unit did not make out great i am still happy with the experiment and do not have that much invested in it so that there is room for modding thanks for the review a always', 'had a dedica it ha 3 water temp i found you had to go to the hottest setting the medium default temp is too cool also the best steaming is by removing the panarello wand and using the rubber inner single hole tube hold it on with a plastic tie wrap or it will blow off in your milk you can play with the timing of the steam switch but i got pretty good milk texture that way in fact this wa how i learned to steam milk the panarello wa not useful when i had this model i did not have a great hand grinder and i would easily choke the machine which created quite a mess i ended up having to remove a screw to take off the screen and clean the coffee grind i cursed this unit and only kept it about 3 month before upgrading today a pid should not be an expensive addition option although the silvia pro with pid is dollar2200 here in canada much too expensive', 'so i have the de longhi ecp3420 i know about my basket issue and have known for a while i can remove the plastic piece inside my current portafilter but because the basket is 51mm i find it very difficult to find the right basket especially a vst one im probably just going to get a bottomless portafilter anyway but how or where do i find a good basket to fit a 51mm', 'i have had my second hand mid 2000 is classic for a little le than a year now and i love it the mod community is fantastic i have only really done the steam wand and blind opv the steaming power doe vary a bit in my opinion and doe take getting to know the machine a bit if you learn about how long it take to heat up and you can start steaming before the light turn on the heating element stay on and you get quite a bit more power', 'this price range is so frustrating and you have nailed exactly why a i expected i wa all set to get the gaggia which is about 300 pound here in au but would have had to void the warranty to get 9 bar and could not fit a latte glass under the gh with scale silvia is over 500 here usually and it drip tray tank are annoying i am someone who really like to know water level for the reason you identify hard to believe that is not a priority for rancilio user oh and no pid on either make for a lot of guesswork until you are veeeery familiar with the machine lelit anna with optional pid wa front runner for a while but again tank and tray did not do it ot for me if it is in a corner with steam knob facing out you can not see the water level bambino result quite good but feel overly light probably could have lived with this compromise but the dual boiler is now available here for around the 400 pound mark and it really feel worth the extra 58mm portafilter pid for grouphead boiler steam boiler mean very predictable result just need to have more bench counter space tl dr recommend bdb if you can get it in this price range would have been tough to survive this melbourne lockdown without it', 'also on dedica one can choose three temperature setting for lighter and darker roast', 'a quick google search say the barista express is slightly over the gbp500 budget but i agree i wish james would properly review it have not seen that many sage review on his channel', 'i recently bought a lelit anna after ton of research so it wa really interesting hearing your opinion on it i got a slightly upgraded model that ha a pid so it is nice to know the exact temperature i almost bought a gaggia classic and strongly considered a rancilio silvia used but what sold me on the anna wa the pid and pressure gauge it is also the nicest looking imo3 i agree that i wish it had more steaming power overall i am really happy with the lelit a someone who is just getting into the world of espresso making', 'when james call out a medium dark or light roast doe anyone else wish he would use cinnamon city full city terminology at the same time some people call city medium but some call it light it get tricky in a video like this when a machine can not handle light roast edit i realized i should not just leave a note like that and be an as especially when i look forward to these new video so much james you do not a fantastic job and i love hearing your thought on anything coffee related so a little constructive criticism and a bunch of credit where credit it due', 'to get excellent steam power on gaggia classic you just have to practice a little temperature surfing i have the original gaggia classic and this is how you do it start steaming before the boiler reach max pressure before light indicator tell you it ha reached the correct pressure which use to take around 30 second after you press the button so start steaming at around 20 25 second and the machine will build pressure during the whole steaming process it work very well', 'great review james 15 year rancilio silvia owner same machine that i have modded over the year adding the better stream wand and pid temperature control replaced the boiler last year and it is running strong again built strong relatively easy to mod repair and it make delightful espresso and steam milk really well for milk based drink', 'i remove the drip tray although the selenoid drip can be caught using a thin cup or a wand cleaning rag not perfect but useful', 'i have one problem with delonghi when i move or remove coffee machine lever all machine is moving', 'the dedica can actually make milk silky if you remove the auto frothing thingy you have a black rubbery steam wand with a little bit of getting used to you can steam one cup worth of milk and get a silky texture', 'mervtones i am still struggling to pull good shot they are too acidic but i am just drinking espresso or long black no milk drink i have tried lot of different type of coffee from light to dark roast i am wondering if it is because the water doe not get hot enough to extract the coffee properly what kind of dose do you use and what is your extraction time', 'i have the bambino a well and agree with everything you said i wa evaluating machine at this price point for a couple month and landed on it due to size and feature another thing that wa not addressed wa heat up time the bambino is ready to pull a shot in 3 second which to me is also a godsend for every day use no turning it on and walking away for minute so everything heat up no needing to spend extra time to surf temp and cool everything down so i can pull another shot i have also found a decent sweet spot with my grinder and basket prep to get some well balanced shot from lighter roast depending on the coffee also ha maintenance indicator when you need to run clean and descale cycle all in all i could not be happier lot of bang for the buck', 'bought my rancilio silvia in 2005 a a 1st proper esspresso machine indending to move on to something better when it expired these thing will not die however so i am still using it today spot on with the comment it a solid thing great steaming fiddly drip tray and tank will have to try a vst basket and see what difference it make', 'excellent video thanks i have owned a rancilio miss silvia and wa happy with her performance moved on to an old rancilio s26 which i am very happy with one feature i like is build quality and availability of part', 'is that a bwt penguin pitcher is this good enough to remove calcium from tap water and use for any of the machine presented i own a gaggia classic and have been making my own water following barista hustle is guide but wa wondering if this pitcher could get a similar result without the mess and effort of making my own water', 'i just got the gaggia a month ago overall i like it but the steam pressure is tough to work with the shot are quite nice but i find i end up pulling slightly sour shot even with typical good brew time and ratio but great value really overall', 'with the gaggia if you start steaming the milk before the ready light come on i find after about 33 second then the heating element stay on giving you way more steam power heat just a little quirk which is easily solved', 'got the sage bambino last winter and it is been awesome through lockdown working from home milk texturing seems really good and a a beginner i have found it is been good to learn on it is too light and that is a frustration but generally i am really happy for the money just need to get single wall basket now and start grinding some bean great set of review thanks', 'the dedica ha 3 temp setting set highest it is much better then i am using graef filter i just cut off the entire bottom part now it is bottomless still a bit acidic but controllable with a trick you never have to grab the machine to lock the portafilter lock the filter then try to move the machine it is a short learning curve but you learn to counter twist the machine movement', 'great video james audio feel a little off for me on this one sort of a swirling type sound in the background that i can not place not sure if it is to do with any of the filtering you are using or something to do with trying to remove the reverb that room cause just a small thing but thought i would let you know', 'i have a gaggia classic pro and you are spot on one small free trick is to essentially temperature surf the steam power once you get more comfortable with the machine you learn how long it take for the steam light to come on the trick is to start steaming before the light come on this trick will keep the heating element on and act more a a thermoblock you get actually very good steam power this way but it doe take some effort and experience similar to temp surfing brew temp not ideal but not too difficult after a few week with the machine', 'alyssaschroeder yep that is what i heard from other people too i mean it is not a bad thing i imagine steaming for two normal size latte would be a delight considering how fast and strong the steam wand is but when you only do milk for one piccolo at a time like i do that power is a bit overwhelming', 'well i actually have one of these in a way at least so i am able to finally chime in my machine which i purchased earlier this year for eur 519 90 would be the lelit anita or pl042temd to give it it correct designation it is a slight step up from the entry level anna that you tested the most noticable difference of course being the inbuilt grinder more on that later the anita also come with pressure gauge toggle switch a much improved steaming wand and a pid i had to add a bottomless porta filter distribution tool and tamper for the lelit is non standard 57mm design i did look into better basket which are available but have not yet decided to get one your vidoe will probably result in me ordering one okay so the grinder really is not that great not a surprise but certainly frustrating especially when you are just starting to get serious about your espresso in the end i gave in and bought a commandante which doe a much better job at grinding for espresso based drink the lelit grinder still get use for coarser setting like vietnamese phin drip filter coffee or the mokka pot though actually i wa not that interested in having an inbuilt grinder to begin with it is simply the only machine in this price range at least with a steam wand on the left side which did matter to me so doe it make decent espresso absolutely no problem frothing milk either thanks to the better steam wand it is still a single hole design but omni directional and well it just seems to work fine no issue regarding pressure or temperature either the other weak design choice which you pointed out are of course valid but in general it is a very capable little machine for the beginner mistake are repeatable no electronics to hide anything from the user and overall solid build quality it did take me two or three month to finally get to a point where i am happy with what i can do with it and the coffe it produce often far better than what pass a espresso in coffee bar okay i do invest in fresh high quality locally roasted bean too', 'got my new basket on saturday and while this might be a case of confirmation bias my shot seem to taste much better indeed i am currently using a very classic italian blend passalacqua mehari though hard to tell if the same applies to lighter roast but i am pretty impressed for the time being at around eur 12 it is not exactly outrageously expensive to upgrade either', 'roberto falk i did find the stock grinder to be slightly inconsistent with shot quality varying more than you would expect which made dialling in very difficult at time it also felt like i wa getting overextraction and underextraction at the same time due to grind quality not being uniform enough switching to the comandante c40 absolutely confirmed my suspicion regarding the grinder there is a very noticeable improvement in sweetness and general quality and texture now of course ymmv', 'i wa originally looking at such a machine but since my research and questioning professional for their take they recommended i go for a lever machine so i am surprised a pavoni wa not discussed despite it being slightly higher than the 500gbp mark when new', 'i think a better video would be to slightly increase the budget 600 pound and include machine like the breville barista express', 'wow these are some heavy espresso machine', 'got a dedica a a first espresso machine in a tiny flat and have a few pointer to add the machine is largely automated but that mean it is also programmable temperate can be tweaked to low medium or high i am unclear on what temperature those actually map to you can set how hard the water you are using is shot length single or double can also be modified simply by holding down the button you also get a little warning light when the machine need a de scaling the wand is not great but a little angling doe help improve the froth that being said others have pointed out the ziptie mod a well a the option to install a silvia wand though that is more involved pressurised basket are not the best by any mean have not tried the mod james suggests but others have outright sawn off part of the basket and used a proper basket for pretty nice result i would say it is a good starter machine especially in a small space with plenty of room for modification and tweaking managed to get a refurbished unit for gbp90 so well worth the price', 'i have had a dedica since 2014 got it a a present and back then it wa around gbp150 i do not like waste so i have been saying i will upgrade when it break but erm it still going i have literally used it every morning and more often than not mid morning a well a when we have visitor apart from when i am away on holiday i would say something like 500 to 600 shot a year so at a machine cost of gbp25 a year and it done over 3000 shot i am blown away with the value i have added obviously the better unpressurised basket a water filter in the tank delonghi do one that fit and fitted a rancillio steam wand for better texture easy mod in your review your absolutely spot on with all of it misgiving i tend to have medium roast and it absolutely fine not amazing but adequate give it a light roast and it just say no i also tend to have a flat white out of it and not really neat espresso so it work perfectly to need and importantly my skill set patience edit of course you know this but to anyone reading that doe not the dediuca work well enough but only if you spend most of your budget on a good grinder', 'update to this watched james video on portafilter basket and purchased a higher quality item and now work with a lot lighter roast now', 'hey james in regard to steaming milk on the gaggia classic i suffer from the same issue a very underpowered steaming pressure and my heat indicator light turn off midway through the steaming process i highly recommend checking out this video it show the right way to get amazing steam pressure from this machine', 'so happy to see this review i have had a dedica for several year mainly to help me learn but also to avoid annoying my non espresso hobbyist husband i use it with a naked portafilter and it make some pretty acceptable espresso but yes they are a little cool for double shot i plugged the hole in the modified portafilter with a screw and nut i am looking to move eventually up to something better so this review wa illuminating a always i am hoping mr hoffman will make a single group eagle one so i can stop considering the anza', 'great video i have the gaggia classic and will definitely pick up the vst basket i am by no mean a barista but can get a good shot out of it although a little inconsistent sometimes because a you pointed out the temp can vary i find if i let out until the temp light out and then catch it just a the light flick back on again i can get something close to consistent i have struggled with the milk and am looking to do a barista course to get my chop up', 'i have the sage bambino plus silver mostly metal and they sell them in germany at least with 4 basket so no extra money for that anyway milk steaming make me crazy the steam wand is so strong and my milk get hot so fast without becoming silky like yours i watched many video but it still hit or miss otherwise i am happy with the machine using the sage grindr and playing with bean and grind size thx for the video always a delight', 'read my mind im newly in the market for a machine to the coffee community anyone know where i can look for a used la pavoni in the u the price for a new europiccola is slightly out of range', 'very good video i myself have a machine around the 500 euro price mark i run through all those machine bar the sage i have to highlight that the newer lelit model look very interesting if you make a 750 or 1000 euro run please consider including the grace or the victoria', 'i started with delonghi dedica i found non pressurized basket for it and actually paired with rancilio rocky grinder if you did not ask too much like 10 espresso shot in 5 minute which we did quite often it provided perfectly oily creamy espresso i did not cut the portafilter though to make it bottomless that would be interesting then moved to gaggia classic pro and i bought bottomless straight away and wow much better perfect espresso totally possible my friend ha rancilio silvia just tuned up with pid electric v bimetal thermostat and it is a beast but still i think next big improvement over gaggia would have to be some hx machine or at least some rotary pump', 'i bought a 2nd hand original gaggia classic opv tweaked to 10 bar only an allen key and pressure gauge needed 18g vst basket steam issue can be worked around by starting to steam before the thermostat reach temp that way it keep the heater element on otherwise a soon a the stat kick in it loos all power not felt the need for a pid yet a slight flush before pulling a shot and i very rarely get a drink i am not happy with all in gbp180 and about 20 minute work', 'i wa tremendously lucky because my first espresso machine wa a silvia that i bought lightly used for 60 buck including a tamper knockbox descaling supply the guy i bought it from wa selling it for his kid and had no idea how good a value he wa providing one of the thing that i really like about espresso machine in this price range is that the build quality can be good enough that they can be sold resold assuming proper maintenance and potentially give people an affordable way to make really good espresso when the temperature cooperates', 'i will say that having a pid is a game changer i have a 2015 gaggia classic with pid brew pressure gauge and modded opv to be around 10 bar the pid can be set for your brew and steam temperature you can set higher temp got light roast lower for darker roast and higher to increase the steam pressure it fix most of complaint james had for the gaggia and silvia', 'i used to have a delonghi dedica a my first coffee machine a a hobbyist i made a few adjustment one being buying a bottomless portafilter and a standard basket like james did and it wa a lot of fun to play with you can also fit a silvia steam wand on it but it would take a couple of hour and some level of electrician knowledge which i do not have another trick only work on model ec685 will not work on ec680 is to remove the steam wand sleeve and use a zip tie to hold the plastic inner tube in place to steam milk which can let you control milk texture better since it will not inject air for you i later sold the dedica and bought a 2003 gaggia classic which wa a lot of fun to learn how to make espresso too this time around it is much easier to fit a silvia steam wand on the gaggia since the older model come with a plastic pannarello wand making espresso on the gaggia is more enjoyable to do it on the dedica but i can feel the frustration of the lack of steam power on the gaggia and i wa genuinely shock when i later sold it and bought an expobar home pulser the pulser being a hx machine can put out a crazily strong steaming power which took me quite a while to get used to', 'thanks for the video james i recently upgraded from the bambino plus to the silvia and the thing i had noticed the bambino wa very very finnicky to dial in it required coffee to be ground uncomfortably coarse and the result with very lightly roasted melbourne coffee wa subpar i also found that it could not maintain 9 bar of pressure consistently and led to many very frustrating brew the silvia is a tinkerer is dream built like a tank like you said i do not mind temperature surfing or the fact that it is a single boiler after a while flushing surfing becomes part of your routine in the same way that pre heating the portafilter doe one last thing is that sage product at least in australia a breville very often go on sale accordingly the bambino plus is placed at a very similar price point to that of the delonghi in australia check ozbargin for deal it often go for dollar350 aud 196 gbp at that price point it is significan notly cheaper than the silvia or gaggia and for someone who similar to me want to investigate if they want to adopt a pet called an espresso machine it is a strong recommendation however for someone who know espresso know what is involved in making it at home i would steer clear away from the bambino plus if possible while it can make decent espresso it can not really make great espresso and you will waste of much coffee trying to get to great espresso that it will not be worth it not a joy to use and not worth the hassle', 'curious if you can control preinfusion on any of the machine that required coarser grind i have a flair and a you know it is a much smaller basket that typically requires a coarser grind because of the deeper puck but the trick for them is to go ahead and grind finer anyways and do a longer preinfusion and also end up with a longer total shot time in the 45 60 second area just curious if something like the bambino for instance can control preinfusion enough to make it work for light roast also maybe i missed it but are some of these machine getting a more in depth video that includes mod i almost thought you would cover it at the end of the video but i know it wa running a bit long', 'a a gaggia classic owner the milk pressure issue is much improved if you begin to steam before the temperature light come on if you wait until the steam is to temp it run out of puff before the heating element kick back in start to steam while it is still heating and the result are much better', 'haha i wa the same lot of comment here from people who are quite happy with theirs a i am maybe we have lower expectation every day i am delighted with my home coffee so i am sticking with mine', 'i bought and returned the dedica i also removed the plastic insert from the portafilter to use an unpressurised basket but blocked the extra hole by finding a small bolt of the right size and cutting it down however i still could not get satisfactory result and it wa just too inconsistent but in retrospect that could have been down to an issue with my one and possibly that the basket wa not great form size for a small kitchen is very good though not really a milky drink person so can not comment on steaming if space and budget are limited it is not bad but would quickly become

is basically a gaggia classic with cheaper more plastic part but similar functionality that wa 8 year ago and the internal component are still going strong it is just a dedicated milk steamer now though ever since i bought a cafelat robot last year also the gaggia is steam functionality suffers from not having enough pressure at green light you really have to start steaming at a certain point to keep the green light from turning on which will force the heating element to continuously produce more steam steaming milk volume higher than 150ml is a big challenge here', 'i own a gaggia classic the older model and the milk streaming would not be a problem at all with this tip after the steam light come on open the valve and let the steam flow after about 10 15 you will hear the steam power drop the boiler then kick in to heat up the steam power would kick up again after just about a few second keep the valve open the entire time so that you hear the steam power change and that is when i

lot james in the beginning of the year we bought the delonghi dedica both for budget reason and to have an experience with piston machine our coffee experience ha definitely improved especially coming

issue with getting coffee to run through at all frothing milk i found quite difficult it doe of course require skill and experience but i have not gotten a really really good result so far which i think make sense given your remark during the video i should just keep practicing recently based on experience from other people mostly online we tried a little lighter roast but i noticed the drink

the finest of the grind the machine can pull shot in any strength you want to set it to best result will come from a medium dark roast coffee some medium to light roast will be harder to work with and

water reduce the mineral level to prevent scale buildup when water is heated if mineral are above a certain level scale will form these machine use thermoblock boiler with narrow passage in which water is heated scale build up in those passage will eventually effect machine performance and if allowed to build up over long period premature machine failure all that said if you happen to have an

my first espresso machine which i very quickly outgrew moving to a barista express then a dual boiler although the prestigio ha brought in some good change i genuinely would recommend against the

solution so first trick you could try is to remove the metal casing for the steam wand and just use the rubber tip from inside it just pull off and can be easily put back on you will not be breaking the machine second trick you could try once you are done steaming the milk cover your milk cup with your hand swirl it around and bang it on the counter a few time this should release some of the larger bubble and create that micro foam aesthetic', 'atlgatorupdate i received an oem replacement basket from an amazon seller in the end i chose to alter an original basket rather than worry about whether a different brand basket would fit the portafilter the alteration wa done simply by cutting the base off the basket with my dremel tool note if you decide to do this yourself be sure to leave enough of a lip that the removable plate at the base of the basket can not not fit through not rocket science but you need to have some common sense to do this in my case i wa happy just having an unpressurized basket i did not worry about the plastic routing disc inside the portafilter which is removable if i decided to remove that i would simply need to purchase a second portafilter to continue to easily use the pressurized basket result the system work perfectly with an unpressurized basket i still use the pressurized basket 90percent of the time a my morning are busy and i do not have the time to play around with dialing in the perfect dose which leaf my weekend to enjoy the process a bit more from the get go i have had the system set up to grind and brew shot that are so very

bought this and the pressure guage doe not move much why', 'hi eslie great question a delonghi tech would be able to assist with your question and troubleshoot with you if needed please connect with a tech by phoning 1888 335 6644 the guage will differ depending on the coffee grind and tamping level if too much coffee or too coarse or fine the pressure may not reach the optimal level i hope this is

awkward to watch headless body move', 'honestly id take the delonghi any day of the week understandably the brevlle pull a slightly better cup of espresso but the speed and convenience of the delonghi is just brilliant it is not a huge deal breaker pulling an espresso shot on the brevlle take like 90 second total where a the specialista take like 50 60 second mostly thanks to the all in 1 contained grinder into portafilter amp built in tamping 30seconds doe not sound like much but pulling 4 espresso shot per day is 2 minute extra through the year that is work out to 12 hour of me needlessly standing at the machine tamping and waiting on espresso not including the extra time though if i have got family or friend over and i am pulling 4 12 shot for that particular night or the extra time

a complete amateur when it come to making the perfect espresso however i have owned both machine and the delonghi is way better imo the reviewer doe not touch on any of the key flaw with the barista

proper espresso can not seem to find it anymore', 'correct we did remove that video due to the oversimplification of implying that the la specialista is simply a dedica with a dedica burr grinder

portafilters because they are not commercial machine a narrower deeper portafilter is le prone to channeling and therefore easier for beginner to get a decent shot with little experience and generally

get better quality then once your budget allows move up to a prosumer machine like the silva or the rocket appartamento', 'instead of milk can you use cream or even heavy cream that is thicker than

me the height of the hopper i am trying to plan the location of a shelf over the machine thank you', 'adjust grind a bit finer avoid oily bean on the new one they remove the optimal pressure area a many have had that issue look at the espresso itself to see if it is coming out consistency should look like a rat tail sound weird but make sense', 'a few month ago i got a bottomless portafilter with a selection of basket from amazon made for the delonghi la specialista the brewing behaves completely differently with a non pressurized basket and needed much finer grinding to get the back pressure up on my breville smart grinder pro i had to move from an index of 10 to about 4 this suggests to me that the built in grinder is not capable of grinding to suit an un pressurised basket some of our favourite bean just do not work with the new basket while other almost non starter bean are proving to be really tasty i have taken to matching the basket to the bean and when i have to use supermarket ground coffee i stick with the pressurized basket the bottomless portafilter is great for a bit of a spectacle but is a pain when you are dosing into two cup so it hardly get used it look pretty classy with brown wooded handle', 'hi grace i did not remove replace the steamer wand i only took the panarello off so i wa using the neoprene rubber pipe directly into the milk this seems ok to start with but over time the pressure and heat of the steam conspired to allow the rubber tube to pop off very disconcerting to stop this happening i got a pack of small o ring from the local hardware store and used one with a tight fit to hold the tube in place it never pop off any more if i knew i could replace the entire steam wand i would but taking off the panarello still allows good latte art', 'i think you hit the nail on the head here a slightly pointless machine it can not do what it is meant to do very well they have added all these neat feature integrated grinder auto tamping etc but all implemented badly seems like a missed opportunity to compete in this price segment', 'shaun mudd yes they could have truly competed with breville if they would have made this slightly more customizable by letting you adjust the grinder to go finer and give a non pressurized basket', 'have you or someone else tried to adjust the grinder level i wonder if that would make it

you that it is a fine grind it should be like fine sand if it is not fine enough then it will come out watery and sour and also i forgot to mention but another thing could be that the coffee bean you are using are too much of a light roast lighter roast are usually not a strong a darker one and are used for drip coffee or french press so if you are using a lighter roast i would suggest trying a darker one and finally the machine may have a pressure problem because if you notice it drip slower when brewing then the machine probably doe not expel enough pressure to be consistent i would try

fine a might be ideal it is important to really tamp it very firmly it is when i learned to do that my coffee started being really good because the very firm tamping had slowed the extraction down you

to same set of issue of calcium build up rubber seal aging etc even with proper maintenance many component do not out last other machine by a meaningful and useful way i think your argument about build quality is mostly centered around the concept of using metal versus plastic in that regard plastic technology improves and you can see breville is good at adapting those new technology to improve durability and touch feel of their product in that regard phillips also do a good job at it are breville perfect is every sense no but they are pretty darn close a you spend more time making

look at the price point for a simple silvia you can get heck a lot more feature under breville brand i find breville be very reliable and if they fail it is likely because of user error or improper maintenance and of course because their machine are way more sophisticated than rancilio and have more moving part gaggia is owned by philip saeco and have long merged product line and is known for superautomatics their manual product line like the classic were designed prior to the merger and have a lot of quality issue for a rather simple machine if you balance out feature modern day

equipment so am not used to the taste that they would provide however before having it i would buy my coffee from starbucks on my way to work or uni i feel that the coffee it produce is light year better than what i used to get from starbucks and i use in almost every day instead of going to starbucks so it is a lot cheaper in the long run plus i get to choose different bean each time i buy more coffee and i really enjoy trying the different flavour they produce so for me an entry level machine doe the job even if it not perfect and i would recommend to anyone who buy an americano every day that is also happy to get up 5 minute early to make their coffee although not one that dig a hole in the ground coffee in the portafilter a that would probably make undrinkable coffee judging by

remember being super annoyed at trying to get my coffee level in the porta with it i am a dab hand at it now but honestly i have looked at buying a separate tamper so many time but they cost a much a i paid for the machine the next issue i have with it is how long it take to warm up to a stable temperature it really need to be left on for a good 30 minute prior to being used if not the heating

good coffee i realised i became continually dissatisfied with the outcome of the coffee produced on this machine i thought it wa me and not the machine but from jame is vid here i now realised that it

totally capable with some effort if you can adjust thebrew pressure and then learn how to properly temp surf the machine if you have a proper grinder it definitely capable of good espresso i do not

year after that i got the carezza which wa actually pretty expensive in it is regular retail price and just garbage because of the pressurised portafilter in my experience the biggest problem are pressurised portafilters and the sad thing is that these are now present on a lot of machine below the 350 price tag even the more expensive gaggia machine are now destroyed by philip saeco because they use the pressurised portafilters however most of those machine are pretty ok machine if you are able to get a regular or naked portafilter holder for them ebay ha some so in general a long a the group head distributes water evenly and the filter is not pressurised it should be no problem to get good espresso out of them given that you know how to make a good shot in the first place one thing not touched up on in this video is the steamwand to be honest most of them are just crap the steam is often not consistent and they are a nightmare to use in the first place the standard tip are

slightest i have a seperate tamper for this reason the issue with the porta filter are also a bit frustrating i leave the puck to cool enough to handle before putting the ground in the bin and rinse

american drip coffee and now i can crank out a great cappuccino for the lady with ease nice and small and fit great in my small kitchen would highly recommend for those with limited space fund and

question maybe someone can help me which is the most suitable and affordable grinder for this machine d', 'great review from a tell it like it is likeable believable person thanks want to comment that i just bought the dedica ec680 which is compared with this newer ec685 it is indicated that there are two major difference but i have only found one major one and one minor one yes the steam nozzle on the newer one ha two setting which is the major change but the drip tray on both model actually come apart not just the ec685 so you can use taller glass in both i call it a minor change however because there is no metallic removable secondary drip tray in the ec680 when you take the drip tray unit apart but if you do not want need flat hot milk then buying the ec680 is a much better deal a the unit are otherwise indistinguishable in how they function and a deal breaker for some inability to use a taller glass is actually possible in the older machine', 'hello just bought my coffee machine coffee grinder and now i have to both set the coffee grinder and the espresso shot i have been reviewing your and some other video in regard to this topic separately but never at the same time a both set ups are interconnected how should i proceed if i set the coffee machine without coffee in it to a specific amount of espresso shot when i add my bean it might be le due to water absorbance

tried 4 different grinder and espresso machine all i end up with apart from a coffee is a mess coffee get everywhere both around the grinder and the filter any tip on how to avoid this or another

looking at this machine is that when i used to make coffee for a living i also used to make really awesome hot chocolate with the frothy steamed milk and this machine is nice and thin which is great in my limited space it more importantly look to make great frothy milk and only heat required amount of water needed for single use at a time i could also make a cuppa tea with it which is awesome given it is my main drink', 'hi guy fun review loved it i went and bought the dedica after seeing the review i like it so far but the amount of coffee it give is tiny i know it is espresso but come on you say in the video that the button are programmable but i think it is only for temperature and water hardness can the amount of coffee be programmed i have to press twice on the middle button to fill my cup thank you great channel', 'if you hold the button either one or two cup the coffee wil flow until you release it this volume will be saved by the machine and all your following shot will

me 100ml 3 4 oz should not it be 30ml and 60ml 1 and 2 oz i know i can reprogram the button but how it is done seems pretty inaccurate to me', 'i found the same thing though it doe depend on coffee

the basket come with a removable bottom now', 'i have the standard machine and honestly there is very little difference having lived with one for a couple of year are there any downside the basket are impossible to clean and if they get clagged up totally knackered you can however get replacement basket on amazon with the bottom tray removable so you can clean them otherwise it is a pretty decent

i complained to shop where i bought it and they managed with importer to give me new one this one work ok if i put much coffee and tamp hard it will choke but the old one choked with le coffee and no

cleaned after every use a the milk get stuck inbetween all those part the rubber and metal etc you can not just blow it out with hot steam 4 it look like they have improved the milk steamer with more

would not rush out and buy the upgraded machine i have the original and it is not drastically different tamper you can get one amazon for around five pound 51mm otherwise it pretty much do is what it

'long time dedica user here here are a couple of tip not mentioned or fully explained in the video 1 absolutely do get the proper non pressurised basket you can get it on amazon or elsewhere either with the whole portafilter or just the basket warning the default delonghi portafilter ha a plastic part inside that prevents inserting a deeper proper non pressurised basket but with a little patience and a hacksaw you can simply cut a centimetre or so from the plastic part to make everything fit so you will be able to continue using the default portafilter p ka the pressurised basket allows you to brew essentially anything but you have very little control over brew time in this video they were quite lucky to get something espresso like in most case you will struggle to square a circle it will either choke or brew too quick or you will get inconsistent random result so definitely get the non pressurised basket 2 the button are programmable just push and keep pressing it for the desired length of time it will then remember how long you pressed it very useful when dialling in new coffee just settle on the right dose and grind size get the time right 25 30 s and next time you will get the same result consistently 3 use darker roast look guy i know we are all fan of the light roasted hipster coffee here but this machine can not extract them properly sorry for the allcaps but this point need stressing i learnt it the hard way so perhaps you will not have to if a specialty coffee roastery in czechia and abroad tell you oh do not worry our espresso roast is perfect for home machine they are lying to you it is still way too light roasted to be extracted well by dedica you see the machine doe not really produce high enough temperature even if you set see the manual the water temp to max i remember reading it only get to about 86 c which is simply too low for proper extraction of what modern roaster call espresso or medium roast what you will get will be intensely sour and unpleasant at least to my palate without sugar on the other hand if you use something more traditional doe not have to be very dark just darker than what most specialty coffee roaster usually offer you will get a quite pleasant traditional espresso thick creamy not too bitter not sour sometimes quite sweet i found that brazilian coffee usually work the best with this machine in short look for more developed roast with low acidity 4 steaming milk the wand ha 2 setting use them you can really produce quite acceptable microfoam if you start with the cappuccino setting get some air in and then switch to hot milk to get that vortex swirling going that produce very fine foam it take a bit of practice but it is not hard watch some video on general tip for milk steaming after you finish clean the wand and then you will have to open the valve again to let off the excess heat steam so that the machine return to the normal coffee brewing setting 5 comandante grinder setting naturally this will depend heavily on the coffee bean and dose you are using i only use non pressurised deeper basket and my dose is usually between 17 19 gram the corresponding comandante c40 setting are usually between 7 10 click finer for darker roast coarser for lighter roast be careful not to choke it machine totally you might rupture the o ring in the grouphead it can be easily replaced but be extra careful not to tear the thread on the screw the bed is made of plastic and it can easily happen a you try to tighten it then it will not hold the shower screen properly and the o ring will keep popping out replacing the plastic part is quite a pain in the as for the non mechanic like me so be aware', 'hi i am trying to use solid metal tamper and bottomless

eureka silenzio grinder i have a single bottom filter basket for two cup and original double bottom my biggest challenge wa consistent extraction at what seems to be that sweet spot for a particular coffee type i did pretty well in avoiding channeling playing with the right amount of coffee and extraction time keeping everything clean and yes sometimes result were surprisingly good but sometimes the acidity bitterness wa present that i could not explain i understand that there are people who might not have this issue and are perfectly happy with their cup of espresso from the single bottom filter basket on dedica i am just not one of them now come the part why i am writing this after month of using a single bottom re watching this video i decided to give it a try with 13 gram in the double bottom basket that came with the machine i wa surprised how good coffee wa and how easy it is to consistently reproduce the same taste compared to a single bottom filter and le messy even without channeling i wa too focused on getting that right shoot with single bottom and completely overlook double bottom i am using a relatively fine grind setting but avoid much force when tampering

replaced a couple of machine within warranty on which that valve failed and made a mess one presumes they have made that more robust by now but to be clear i am into modding my silvia ha a pid controller that i installed it is also easy to find vendor who pre install them last time i checked and i keep toying with the idea of better insulating the boiler and adding a pressure gauge which may be easier now than the last time i checked i got stopped by the need to drill through the metal exterior which i am fine with in principle i just do not own any drill bit that would do the job maybe i am especially rough or careless definitely careless once when i accidentally left it switched on with the steam wand open during a party and blew the boiler by letting it run empty but i have had to do some internal repair and part replacement that boiler swap wa the big one and i am not counting the necessarily frangible component the brew and steam wand gasket but i have had a couple of leaking seal along the copper pipe and in fact have just been using a french press lately a it is got one right now i am not sure that sort of maintenance requirement is a bad thing it seems about in

of the very simple and basic thermostat in the machine the rancillio is the same but because the boiler is substantially larger the temp swing are slower i am hoping the pid will stabilize the temp on the gaggia a bit better do not get me wrong i just pulled a latte for my son which he love but i have had a few time where the steam heat just did not seem to be there if it still continues to bug me i may have to spring for the beastly steam of the rancilio another great thing about the gaggia and the rancilio is that they are endlessly repairable every part is replaceable and available and if you are at all handy you can do it yourself like i said i have watched a few video on installing a pid and i have now got the part for dollar50 the gaggia wa a dollar350 refurb from wholelattelove and

bigger if you remove drip tray so in other word i like it delonghi ha best price performance ratio in my opinion', 'how about reviewing low watt bean to cup machine or similar we tried using our

a delonghi dedica that i wa given for free for about a year now and yes the milk wand only doe bubbly frothed milk and would turn over half my jug into non liquid by the end however to get around this i accidentally lost the silver tip cover one day and used the simple rubber tip underneath and it made very silky milk now the opposite is true and you can not froth milk with the tip so if you need both for your recipe then you have switch between the two', 'nice review btw you put the drip tray grid the wrong way round on the lelit if you put it the other way it look way better cause there s no gap anymore and also it s not wobbling around etc i ve got the lelit anna but with pid pl41 tem for a while now i can really recommend it and i really think it s especially good for beginner cause you always have some kind of visual feedback and also control in the end it s the same process a with a machine without pid trial and error but it s le of a guessing game cause you can see the temperatur in the kettle and can easily work your way up to a good shot by adjusting the different parameter grind temperatur time etc i got mine new for 390euros i think you get good value for your money also one important thing is the spare part availability it s really easy to get lelit spare part so you could potentially have the machine for a whole life i guess if a part your delonghi is broken well you can throw it away a much a i love it here are some con for those of you that consider buying the lelit like james already mentioned the steam isn t a powerful and also pretty watery but with a small single circle mashine you ll never get that good steam but it seems lile the rancilio doe better here the water tank it ha a strange odor to it after a while and the opening is pretty unhandy do get water in without spilling and also almost impossible to clean properly the new one have a better tank with a big opening i think almost every anna owner changed the tank into a glas vase or another plastic tank i did cut a bigger hole in it you can only see the water level in the tank from one side unhandy if you need to place it next to a wall the portafilter doesn t slide in too well so you got ta hold it while putting it in o think that d different from machine to machine and i guess it s because the tolerance while building aren t that high on this part the first two machine i ordered were scratched really badly in this area the drip tray itself is a bit wobbly cause of the design the drip tray grid doesn t habe enough hole in it too much metal cover if you wan na steam in the drip tray after steaming mill it really make a mess cause of the watery steam hitting the metal grid u get used to it and either steam in a glass or a towl or place it directly above a hole the top part aka cup warmer doesn t really get that hot the tamper it come with is just a cheap plastic thing u can t use the single espresso portafilter don t know the proper name somehow me and a lot of other people can t get good shot with it but that s also a common problem not only with lelit sorry if my grammar etc is wrong i m from germany', 'can you do the best bean to cup coffee machine',

have a confession i sneered at mr hoffman after my first exposure to his channel where he reviewed a gbp300 bean to cup machine from aldi around about that time i had moved from instant coffee to a pod machine and wa enjoying the novelty of all the random flavour option that they offered i had the opportunity to upgrade pretty cheaply to an espresso machine when a friend of mine bought one a part of a return pallet deal from amazon he had bought in an auction house it is a delonghi bean to cup and ha a built in grinder so it is a bean to cup machine it wa effectively a new machine but with one small crack in the water tank which i replaced for gbp20 it is a bit more of a faff than instant or pod coffee but omg the difference really is remarkable i do not think i will ever be a sniffy a james but now i do appreciate that there is more to it than most people realise now i look forward to trying exotic roast and i am enjoying and appreciating coffee more added benefit is that

part remove the cover then remove the first tray and you have tray that can hold a regular size coffee cup so that my double shot for a cappuccino can go straight into the cup rather than first into a brew cup to be poured into a larger final cup or simply run double shot twice for a regular cup of coffee startup 45 second and you are ready to brew milk you need some practice with all machine with a little practice the delonghi dedicate gave me perfectly creamy milk and very importantly i did not have to use an amount of milk more than just for my regular coffee cup size cappuccino temperature the brew temperature can easily be set separately each for single and double shot raise the temperature to reduces the chance of sourness and bring out acidity dry touch top of tongue basket grind the

but let me assure you he is not trying to tell you that you need 400hp it is more that we know how good coffee can be and all these option have varying degree of compromise that can prevent you in one way or another from achieving a really good cup in keeping with a car analogy let say the top end desirable cup is a dailey focused car that is not a luxury car but is a more expensive car because it ha a better build quality and le fault than it more affordable competitor they will all get you to a to b but one of those choice ha le fault better maintenance experience and maybe even is a car more friendlier than the rest for doing home repair it is not that we are insulting low budget i am on a lower budget trying to educate myself and trying to discern right now how much do i want need to invest a we speak i have been holding off for year now on getting my first espresso machine for much of the reason and flaw revealed in this video it is that we know each of the option ha something that might really be holding it back from making peak good coffee or something at least very close and if you know how good it could be it is really an insult and painful to all of u a coffee lover to have to recommend a machine that still cost something but will prevent the buyer from making peak quality coffee the take away i am trying to say is he is not telling you to buy a bmw m2 c instead of a civic because it is an objectively better car even though what you need is a reliably affordably daily and you do not need a track car instead think of it that he is trying to warn you away from buying car in the category of the pontiac g5 they are cheap and like any car get you to a to b but they are infamous for multitude of issue making it one of the worst budget daileys you could pick we are trying to say maybe spend more money on a new accord or civic because yes it is more money whose function is to only daily but the point is that you are trying to pick something le terrible it all come down to how happy you are with the end result coffee from each budget range if you are happy with the coffee you can get from lower budget machine than that is fantastic and no one should be insulting that like i am stuck right now because i would rather not spend a much a a 3090 gpu on a machine and grinder individually but i also really do not want to get a cheaper machine that is finicky and difficult and will hold me back from making a perfect cup once i get the experience i actually do not know how much i need to spend to get that but i took away some really solid info from this video about the downfall of each machine', 'wow tiny cup of coffee is so expensive now do a best dollar10 000 coffee maker', 'malcolm sutton this is a review of the new one for a start i can get

automatic milk steaming but the steam wand is on a ball joint so you have a bit more flexibility and it is also significan notly cheaper i got it for about half the price of a gcp and i am super satisfied seems like it pull good tasting shot i bought an unpressurized basket and it make steaming milk for latte really easy i can totally see myself using it for a while before eventually upgrading to something like the rancilio silvia', 'one of the worst thing to hear is professional background you mean starbucks with portafilter and dark roast duh if that is professional then leave that behind also i am not sure who are the dumbs always insisting on 25 30 second crap ever since i heard that you can not overextract coffee i just gave up on time and thus reduced lot of frustration in getting nice shot esp that of lighter roast time i have gone up a high a 1 minute 21 second and i always aim for far le than 1 2 and i start my time from the first drop mind that the grind i set is way finer so it may take up to 50 second to see first drop per me ristroto is the best one to go for i have gone a low a 1 0 5 and there is no name for it yet but for super super light roast check your grinder first or else it can spoil it the lowest yield result is best taste and i have cheaper version of delonghi the model you are showing is crap with all automatic timer etc cheaper one is much better just punch a hole in portafilter and you end up with naked one smaller size help because you can have more cup at a time and the infatuation about foam duh btw for delonghi the best flow rate is drip drip drip if it is moving faster then you will not get a good shot and drip drip drip mean no foam sorry instagramers', 'i have a dedica at home i have had the pressurised portafilter

three shot with temp surfing and rinsing after shot water doe not go stale like in big tank i just refill every morning and empty drip tray every day for me this work very well do not have stale water or moldy drip tray anna ha 3 way solenoid no hissing or sputtering coffee when removing portafilter all in all anna is your starting point a machine to buy instead of 200something priced machine which look nice in shop and look like good enough for daily coffee but basically always under performs and waste bean which yearly cost more than a machine if you keep track of cost p s dedica and probably also sage allow to adjust temperature of water low standard and high this could help a bit only because of inferior group james mentioned but still better than plain nothing manual ha the info how to change temp', 'hi there i bought the delonghi dedica 2 year ago and been making a minimum of two cup per day everyday honestly i got this due to the small formfactor and known brand name it doe look rather elegant on the counter and doe not upset wife too much i found the result are similar to what you have explained with espresso being fair but these day i drink white to sweeten up the bitter i tried to grind coffee fine but then the machine struggle and sometimes she just want to stall i didnt know you could upgrade the portafilter cup for a non pressured environment looking for detail on this replacement could you help otherwise for the price it is a decent espresso machine', 'i also have the silvia but with pid installed and a better basket a tuned by my local roaster espresso

right it is so much easier to extract evenly with the gaggia compared to the dedica especially the lighter roasted blond quality thank you for your video giving good guidance', 'while this is a great video and probably accurate i wish i never saw it i have been looking to get into espresso but now i feel like i can not get a decent cup without spending thousand of dollar on a fancy machine and

review and would have appreciated a comparison between the stock and upgraded basket a i am not convinced by that modification you can remove the drip tray to fit a larger cup latte glass mug and there is a basic flatter drip tray with rubber edge under the tray with the float the steam wand can operate like a traditional one of you just slide the cuff from cappuccino to hot milk you can also change the temperature and pressure in a slightly awkward menu guided by different timed button flash once you set it to your preference however it save those setting so worth an initial play with the setting just feel some of these point counter the criticism raised', 'spoiler the cup wa empty every time', 'totally bias', 'before it even start i am quietly rooting for the rancilio silvia i had one of those for year before i upgraded to what i have now which is a wega mininova the main reason i ditched the rancilio is becuase i wanted dual boiler and a hot water outlet plumbed through a water filtration softening unit not long after i actually purchased the wega rancilio released the silvia pro which come with all of those thing i am just not sure if it is a plumbed unit though i am sure it ha the option though i had my original silvia retro fitted to run a a plumbed unit all that being said the rancilio silvia is an absolutely fantastic unit and it make such good coffee if you were just making coffee for one or two people it is more than adequate incidentally the grinder i purchased with the silvia wa also made by rancilio the rancilio rocky non doser version and is still the grinder i use today i could not recommend that grinder more highly anyway back to the video i suppose finger crossed for the silvia edit it wa cool to see the silvia do so well i must say one of the first thing i did do wa install a pid on my machine due to the variant in water temperature i found that particular mod wa money well spent and the quality of coffee wa much more consistent great video a per usual and very informative review', 'it totally put me off getting one apparently spending gbp500 on a machine to make some hot bean water still is not enough this whole video just made me want to make an instant coffee and get on with my life', 'would you say that spending the money and time installing a pid for the silvia would make it the best budget friendly option or with that added expense doe it move it into another tier with better option', 'i have had the delonghi dedica in stainless steel finish for a few year the clearance is pretty bad i pulled the drip tray out so i can fit my glass under it apparently the current deluxe model have more clearance that the older model i have initially i kept pushing button too by accident when holding it to fit the filter but honestly i got used to that and learned to hold it right i never even think about it anymore otherwise i have no complaint i use it with a dark roast it is been churning out 8 to 10 coffee a day for year between me and my partner and ha been a great performer', 'the delonghi dedica actually ha temperature control which can be set to low medium high medium being default no mention of actual the temperature it relates to though newer model also feature a removable drip tray that give a bit more clearance for taller cup these two are mentioned a con but seem to be simply overlooked changing the steam pipe for an actual real one is also quite simple and only requires a screwdriver and pipe it will improve steaming significan notly also if you top of a centimeter of the plastic piece that is removed in the video an unpressurized basket will fit without any hassle i actually removed the second bottom of my pressurized basket with a dremel leaving me with a normal basket take a bit of work but if coffee is a hobby for you it can be a fun little project', 'i own delonghi dedica but the metal chrome instead of bright red plastic version of outside cover which is fine looking issue is when we manage to touch it very often it leaf lot of shade of fingerprint it can be cleaned but additional work to clean that machine is annoying on the other side i am satisfy how well that machine work you can change the temperature of preheated water by setting they can be accessed by button but it is not quick a other espresso machine secondly you can change the level of water hardiness filter i do not change it because poured filtered wather through dafi filter do it is job the basket is fine but i recommend to change especially for espresso the tray is small compared to other machine to put tho shot of espresso cup but hey it ment to be a compact coffee machine the handle is well balanced on top we have got a heater for cup overall it is worth it price', 'i could not agree more the dedica ha instruction for lowering and rising the temperature in the instructive it also suggests warming up your cup by running hot water on it from the basket which is obviously to also heat up the basket thus aiding with the extraction process speaking of which i actually think that the plastic piece on the basket is key to prevent hot water and hot espresso from touching cold metal since the plastic actually insulates it i feel like when you dismantle the basket and take out the plastic piece then it will lower your espresso temperature playing with the temp setting and also with the grind with different coffee blend ha made my experience with the dedica quite enjoyable for over two year already my rule of thumb is using the low temp setting for dark roast medium for both dark and medium roast and high temp for either lighter roast or for certain more dense and or more acidic coffee another great thing about the dedica is that you can instantly stop the flow by pushing the button again if you push the button and leave it pressed the flow will continue until you release and the machine will remember that setting i e very basic but you can program it', 'oscar garc a

machine they can only make a few coffee and in europe they have to turn themselves off when idle in a short time frame to save power yet they all have cup warmer on top that can not get a cup warm

spot on no surprise my husband and i live on opposite end of the u and i have a silvia at my house because i like to tinker with thing and i bought a sage for his place because he just want a decent latte without having to fuss with anything i really enjoy using both machine and they are totally different beast the silvia for sure make better coffee but for the price and convenience the sage is a surprisingly good little machine because the silvia is a gateway machine to the higher end prosumer espresso machine for many you can find them used and often already modded i found mine used with a pid already installed for dollar400 usd i think i am the third owner and it still work beautifully', 'i have the gaggia classic pro and overall i am pleased with it i agree that the steam power is a little weak but it work id be interested in a mod video on this machine to adjust brew pressure and a pid controller for temperature there are some 3d printable file floating around on thingiverse for

espresso kept in a good container in the fridge not a a hobby but a the way we did this in household since always now i moved to the uk and tried to find the great saeco aroma stainless steel boiler to be disappointed it wa bought by philip and discontinued they are pushing graggia now with an shitty aluminium boiler now i find myself having to pay for a grinder not easy to find packet of pre ground espresso here and an overpriced espresso machine because it is become trendy in northern european and american country this should not be an expensive hobby but an affordable accesible daily way to have your cup of coffee if you wanted to besides a rant this is a futile attempt to tell everyone espresso is not rocket science i think it is taken waaay too seriously and definitely no one

to others i have used give it a slight increase in weight which allows me to remove the portafilter one handed provided the bottom is griping the benchtop properly also the removable drip tray ha a nice i assume stainless steel cover underneath so that mug and larger cup do not just sit in the plastic bottom which is a nice feature to be included just found it interesting that there were some difference that may or may not have caused a different opinion of it edit by the way after just an hour or so about going through the setting setting the water temp etc i think the difference between

result is good enough for me getting the single basket is a must though', 'a note to the dedica part i have the scultura ecz 351 which is very very similar to dedica literally just a different design with the same part inside even the basket are the same and i had it modified to my need a naked portafilter solved the three hole problem i also installed an ims la pavoni basket the 51mm one i evened the edge to fit because it is curvy i agree none of these delinghis are warm enough barely 70c it is ok i guess but a pid would be neccessary with light roast it is indeed real pain to use i tend to use medium roast with it bottom line is with a better basket it is usable but at this price point i would also suggest to save up for a better machine', 'out of interest why do you catch 2 single

not really qualified to give any meaningful advice if you still want my input i can think out loud first i would figure out how many customer and how much coffee you have potential to sell in peak hour from that you need to determine what your ambition are is it good enough to serve some hot brown drink or do you want to be a high end shop will you serve coffee to take away or only seated customer i imagine coffee to go customer are more in a hurry delay may not be acceptable will you offer both single and double shot coffee in that case you may want to look at a dual brew head machine what if the machine break down can you afford to stop serving while getting the machine fixed maybe you need a professional service agreement that guarantee next day repair do you have time to refill the water tank and empty the spill tray or do you need a plumbed in machine my gaggia kept giving me problem several time a valve wa blocked with some coffe ground the water flow almost stopped and the coffee tasted crap got bored of disassembling the machine to clean out the valve i now use a prosumer machine bezzera unica pid it is a single boiler dual use machine like the one tested here perfect for me who only drink espresso le than ideal for milk based drink if i wa a milk drinker i probably would have bought a heat exchanger hx machine it can deliver coffee and steam without the wait but is le temperature stable and may need purging to get correct brew temperature for home use that is fine if the coffee taste bad you can always make a new cup for a professional service that could ruin reputation example rocket appartamento a dual boiler is more expensive but ha separate system for coffee and steam and with a pid digital temperature controller you can be reasonably sure

it with the price of the machine if you are like me drinking 2 3 doulbe espresso a day then your price point is around that machine or let say around 400euros prosumers or hobby baristas usually buy machine above 1000euros because a you said the machine between 500 1000 require tinkering expansion and awkward installment in order to bring maybe the result you are expecting now question yourself

again tank and tray did not do it ot for me if it is in a corner with steam knob facing out you can not see the water level bambino result quite good but feel overly light probably could have lived with this compromise but the dual boiler is now available here for around the 400 pound mark and it really feel worth the extra 58mm portafilter pid for grouphead boiler steam boiler mean very

install a pid', 'i have been using gaggia classic pro for almost two month now and i spent the first couple week getting to know the machine at factory setting i have to say my experience with the steamer is totally different from yours i thought the steamer wa very powerful and it worked the milk almost too fast for me part of it probably due to the fact that i usually steam only small amount for piccolo and the milk rose to the desired temperature so fast that it wa a bit hard to get proper milk texture at first note that i live in thailand and the model sold here could be a bit different after couple week i installed the opv mod spring to switched to 9 bar and loved it a week later i installed pid controller both mod actually came at the same time but i decided to install one at a time to see how much each of them affect the machine is performance and i got two thing out of it the shot are now very consistent because i now know what temperature i am brewing with and no more surfing the second benefit is that the pid also control steamer temperature so i adjusted it to be a bit le powerful about 140c not sure what is the factory set up wa but it wa higher for sure so i have more time to steam my small portion of milk all thing considered i have to say i am very happy with my gcp and a bit surprised to see it came in last in the steaming race love your review though and i have to say i knew from the get go you would pick gcp and miss silvia lol', 'i just want to add that yes you might want to mod a rancilio and it might add to the cost but i think this is a massive plus for this machine the ability to grow a you learn and add v waiting much longer and saving more money to buy a more expensive machine with feature you do not understand yet might be even more frustrating it is hard for someone new to understand the impact of a pid in the cup this machine ha room to grow and you can grow with it it is a fantastic starting point', 'great lineup james

enjoy every morning i have very hard water and even though i filter i get scaling issue more often than i wish i had i am currently thinking about upgrading my grinder to a smaller and more efficient

sell the opv spring set to lower the brew pressure to 9 bar and pid kit for really reasonable price he is super knowledgeable and helpful and will ship anywhere in the world hope that help it totally worth the money i promise you', 'me too i bought the classic and i agreed with everything james had to say about it i recently installed a pid on it and a 9 bar opv spring the machine is in another class now with the pid you get super consistent brew temp and also massively improved sustained steam pressure id highly recommend it to all classic owner', 'this is the video i have been dreaming

in a tiny flat and have a few pointer to add the machine is largely automated but that mean it is also programmable temperate can be tweaked to low medium or high i am unclear on what temperature those actually map to you can set how hard the water you are using is shot length single or double can also be modified simply by holding down the button you also get a little warning light when the machine need a de scaling the wand is not great but a little angling doe help improve the froth that being said others have pointed out the ziptie mod a well a the option to install a silvia wand though that is more involved pressurised basket are not the best by any mean have not tried the mod james suggests but others have outright sawn off part of the basket and used a proper basket for pretty nice result i would say it is a good starter machine especially in a small space with plenty of room for modification and tweaking managed to get a refurbished unit for gbp90 so well worth the price', 'i have just recently gotten into coffee and after doing some initial research my choice landed on the sage bambino it ha the added value of taking le space in my kitchen with grinder the table top got a bit busy i absolutely love the machine and i share your opinion it is great little machine to start with and it ha feature that allows you to actually learn without having to get too

factory installed it in the range of 500 pound', 'completely agree with your conclusion james i started on a gaggia classic early 2000s model and it wa great but lacked steam power needed the opv mod to bring the pressure down portafilter is crap so got a bottomless and a vst basket got a 3d printed drip tray that is skinnier to give more space under the portafilter ims shower screen but it really excelled with a pid all in i honestly probably spent gbp200 odd extra on part for a machine i picked up for gbp100 on ebay i really can not fathom why they made the new classic pro still to have what 15 bar of pressure and a pressurised basket leave that to a cheap delonghi people spending gbp400 on a machine either want it to perform like a prosumer machine or they want a bean to cup not these weird half way machine i think the new machine just miss out on securing a potentially massive audience because they have targeted it wrong i am not on a lelit but a marax i absolutely love it their higher end machine though all come with 58mm portafilters i can not for the life of me work out why they would not apply this across the board why limit the tamper portafilter basket shower screen gasket etc that you can buy it doe not make any sense basically there is a fair few good machine here but they are all stuck in a limbo for me in between being a gimmicky toy aimed at newcomer with low budget and prosumer machine that offer so much more', 'would love to see one of these for bean to cup superautomatics which machine make the best coffee when james skill and experience is not

if you use item ie switch it on you are only entitled to 50percent back shocking', 'hi there can you tell me whether it make a really hot cup of espresso a i like mine hot bought a smeg and it lukewarm and not to my liking at all thanks x', 'i started with delonghi dedica i found non pressurized basket for it and actually paired with rancilio rocky grinder if you did not ask too much like 10 espresso shot in 5 minute which we did quite often it provided perfectly oily creamy espresso i did not cut the portafilter though to make it bottomless that would be interesting then moved to gaggia classic pro and i bought bottomless straight away and wow much better perfect espresso totally possible my friend ha rancilio silvia just tuned up with pid electric v bimetal thermostat and it is a beast but still i think next big improvement over gaggia would have to be some hx machine or at least some rotary pump', 'oooo so if the person that win it on your patron want you to install the

setting right out of the box were great drink are hot even on the medium setting foam from the auto frother is great allowing you to choose how much froth you want the user interface is fairly simple oh and the clean up is stupid easy contrary to some other brand that require pill and special basin etc this frother only requires you to turn the knob to clean and with 10 second it is done remove the milk canister and put it in fridge until needed honestly i really can not find any fault with this machine we will see how it hold up to daily use', 'the eletta can go to a finer grind size which is better for espresso shot and milk based beverage it also ha an active cup warmer which can make a big difference in beverage temperature the dinamica ha better customization more drink and a really

babila it is a more durable build with a metal skin on the case front and top it ha 2 boiler so it is faster when making milk drink it ha more clearance under the spout for taller cup like travel mug my favorite feature is the flow control dial on the babila is spout it allows one to fine tune flavor by speeding up an extraction for larger coffee and slowing it down for espresso i like the babila milk carafe which doe a quick automatic steam cleaning through the frothing component when you push the milk dispensing spout over the steam go through the carafe handle and into the drip tray so there is no mess after that the carafe go back in the fridge ready for next use it also ha a manual steam wand so you can froth to latte art quality if desired in case you missed it here is my video review of the babila it includes a look at the gaggia accademia which is a very similar machine hope that help marc', 'hi how can i set my favourite coffee for example i like it very strong and very

become available instantly after the first cup is poured or is there a delay', 'if i set to fine grind setting after 3 cup if i feel the taste is only bitter and no acidic furthermore the water flow

taller cup', 'hi rr have a look at the gaggia accademia it handle taller cup ha 3 level of milk froth density using a carafe system manual frothing wand in addition to carafe and my favorite feature

accademia including review marc', 'hi joe giving actual temp is difficult a a variety of factor have an affect temp of milk in carafe ambient temp temp of serving cup etc most machine produce a froth of 130 145f depending on external factor pro baristas froth milk to 140f a that is were milk is sweetest due to heating marc', 'hello this probably the best review for this machine on youtube and it made me purchase the eletta since it had so many feature and make many kind of drink with one touch however i receive it last week and i feel i got a faulty machine the one touch for cappuccino and latte macchiato is making the same exact coffee size and foam even if i set the froth dial at the middle position for latte macchiato i still get the same size foam and flavor i am aware that you can customize the quantity of milk and coffee but that defeat it purpose for being a fully automatic with presets another issue is that when making flat white or caffelatte the machine will overflow my largest cup which is about 400 ml also the froth foam for flat white is twice larger than a cappuccino foam even if i set the dial to the middle position btw i did the reset twice from the menu but still same issue however all other drink like espresso double espresso and long coffee are working fine do you think i should get a replacement since i still got 3 week left of the return window thank you', 'thearmybrat23 i have the same issue i can not adjuste the cup size i can not have small or big size cappucino or latte always the same how did you solve it', 'hi jodi apology for the delayed response thank you for the comment and question well you are doing all the thing to get a hotter drink for higher milk temp you could try using an using an airier froth setting on the carafe dial it change froth density but put milk in contact with steam longer so it get warmer a couple other idea warm the milk for 10 second prior to adding to carafe bottom line is the machine are designed to heat milk into the goldilocks zone of temperature for most apparent sweetness which is around 140f if you go to a specialty cafe not the chain that is what you will get from a properly trained barista can not tell you how many chain shop heat milk far too much i know some people want it hot i think some of that come from consumer who expect a latte to be near the same temperature a a cup of drip coffee and it should not be we have a lot of former baristas working in our customer service center and i have heard their story anecdotally they estimate 75percent of customer walking into a chain cafe do not even know there is espresso in a latte and they were asked on a regular basis to make drink hotter they would do it but know they were ruining the flavor all that said i do think you should have your drink at the temperature you like there are no super auto that do extra hot milk all go to that 135 145ish range maybe microwave after the drink is made to bring the temp up breville doe make a semi auto machine the oracle touch with automatic milk frothing in a pitcher with settable milk temp and froth density it is a semi auto so it not press a button for a drink but it is automated far more than the typical espresso machine see it in action here it froth milk up to 165f and streamlines much of the manual process of semi auto espresso marc', 'hi colleen neither machine technically make a drip coffee a they use the espresso brewing process what they make is considered a long coffee sometimes called a cafe crema it sound like you want to make a larger cup of coffee the eletta can make long coffee and us pulse brewing which lower the brewing pressure in pulse to avoid over extracting the coffee when making larger cup the pulse brewing process produce a coffee that more closely resembles drip than many competing machine compared to the saeco i like the pulse brewing cup warmer slightly higher water capacity angled display adjustable milk froth density and included manual steaming wand hope that help marc', 'hi je thanks for the question the delonghi eletta machine are very similar the 44 660 b ha a different display and control panel accademia ha 3 level of menu programmable froth density by drink babila doe not both the gaggia machine have a manual steam wand in addition to the self cleaning carafe you can do a much finer froth using the manual wand i also love the flow control dial on the gaggia machine it is awesome if you switch between espresso and larger cup of coffee the e8 ha the nicest display and is a little easier to maintain it use cleaning tablet for the non removable brew group and if you use a water filter no descaling is ever required on the other machine you remove the group and rinse with tap water once a week hope that help let me know if you have more question marc', 'hi i would go with the anima prestige it ha slightly larger capacity for water and used coffee and ha clearance for taller cup', 'do you think this machine would be right for an office where the consumption of coffee in various form is roughly 50 cup a day', 'hi calico thanks for the question you can program the long coffee for higher volume if you like it strong you may want to program for a smaller volume and brew 2 into a single cup be aware spout clearance on the eletta is 5 5 so a tight fit for taller mug cup marc', 'great thorough review thank you for this this seems to fit our need perfectly before purchasing i wa curious if you knew if the entire brewing process for a standard cup of coffee is plastic free once it leaf the plastic water tank i know the plastic part are bpa free however doe water ever touch plastic once it leaf the water tank maybe the same question for the milk process if you happen to know again thanks for the great video feed', 'hey thanks marc for the quick reply i wa able to get in touch with a delonghi representative who wa able to open up one of their machine to help answer the question her reply wa that it go from the water tank plastic and through a plastic tube all plastic are bpa free into an aluminum heating element where water would first get hot once the water is heated there it then will quickly pas through a small grey plastic part a it get released dripped into the coffee cup so the only time that hot liquid come into contact with any form of plastic is this small piece of grey plastic based on this do you happen to sell any model where the heated liquid only pass through metal component piping', 'hi i have the ecam45760b and i noticed that the drip tray is filling fast from the back left corner during a standard coffee is made i measured the water in the tray after 1 standard coffee and i have about 25ml of water that is left in the tray per coffee i always keep a cup under the sprout and even when i look under during a rinse when it is turn off i have another large amount of water filling the tray it is a new machine would that be an issue', 'hi paul assuming you set the machine to max brewing temp other suggestion is to pre heat cup you are brewing into a cold cup can quickly drop the temp of the coffee 10 20f', 'whole latte love i mostly use extra long long coffee cupwarmer is really a gimic because it doe not get special warm and it take 30 45min before cup start to get lukewarm if i preheat thick ceramic cup with teawater from the machine temperature for extra long coffee get up to 154 8f hot water get up to 156 5f', 'hi that temperature seems on the low side so a few question what size regular coffee are you making and what type of cup are you using the machine is cup warming feature cold cup especially thick ceramic will quickly cool coffee by a much a 20 degree depending on ambient condition in most case these machine brew internally at 195 200f a coffee flow thru the machine it cool some but most machine should deliver coffee coming out the spout in 170 range scale buildup in the thermoblock boiler can effect heating performance over time so critical to stay on top of descaling maintenance', 'hi ahmed here is a link to a side by side spec comparison of the eletta and accademia a few key thing to consider comparing the 2 machine first temperature of coffee is essentially the same between the 2 they both have milk carafe the eletta us a dial to adjust froth density from the carafe the accademia ha adjustable froth density but you choose from 3 level in a menu to adjust both have steam wand but the accademia is a manual wand while the eletta is is an autofrothing wand the elettta is wand doe a nice job getting a fine texture but you will have more control some skill required with the accademia is to the point of doing milk definitely capable of pouring for latte art the accademia ha more metal on the case a little more solid in construction also more spout clearance for say a taller travel mug with accademia i use the accademia nearly everyday so i am a little biased perhaps one of my favorite feature on it is the sps flow control dial near the spout i often switch between doing espresso and long coffee into a taller travel mug that dial make a huge difference in the extraction reduce the flow rate for espresso and increase for long coffee to ovoid over extraction the eletta doe the pulse brewing for more of a drip style coffee but it take a while and 2 grind cycle to make a large cup i am fine with the longer coffee which come a lot faster on the accademia hope this all help i know it can be a tough choice let me know if you have any more question and i will do my bet to get you the answer', 'is this a good device if i wanted to brew 4 shot americanos or something closely equivalent into a large cup it seems this device will pull two shot so can it do another 2 fairly quickly

cup warmer system the eletta top is a 179 usd premium over the evo here where i live is it worth the premium', 'hello our eletta cappuccino evo ha the cup warmer on the top of the unit also one of the biggest reason we bought that unit wa because of the fully automatic nature oh and the price on sale', 'hi cihad i am not familiar with the evo personally since it is not sold in canada where we are based that being said i would say that the cup warming is one of the essential and valuable thing about the eletta machine and would absolutely be worth the extra fund you can program your machine to turn on in the morning prior to waking up and can lead to substantially hotter beverage hope this help liam', 'to quickly answer your question yes you will just need to brew a standard espresso shot and add hot water from the spout that being said the hot water spout is not located under the brewing spout and so you will need to shift the glass there is not a pre programmed americano function unfortunately liam', 'ah good question both of these model are extremely similar and each have their own advantage so it will depend on your personal preference reason to buy the dinamica lattecrema

delonghi and it made an average of 4 5 cup per day for 15 year and when it died it wa just because they were no longer supplying spare if i could have got the rubber seal it would have continued to

seems however your real concern is more crema all machine you mention should produce similar amount of crema if using the same coffee i put crema in quote a these machine all use a pressurized filter basket depending on who you ask the crema produced with pressurized basket is a little different than crema produced in a non pressurized basket where it is the grind tamp of the coffee which creates the brewing pressure for some that difference is not a big deal for other those at the espresso geek level it is a total deal breaker if honest crema is what you are after i suggest a machine with a standard size weight portafilter and regular non pressurized filter basket these require grinding before use so a grinder many lower cost gaggia machine come with standard size pfs and both pressurized and non pressurized filter basket with those you can start without a grinder and move up to non pressurized brewing if when you pruchase a grinder here are two gaggia machine you might

extraction pressure many shot do not reach the optimum level while pulling shot but still make a good coffee the spent puck are solid and consistent and dry not watery but overall it a good clean self contained machine and make good coffee at the same flavor a peet is and starbucks if you know what your doing and if you use the 2 cup filter and for le than 20 cent per cup but once it again it make

6year old breville barista broke pull a good shot the only issue i have is the milk steamer you can not control the steam it is either all the way on full force or off and then turn off after 60 second the steamer ha a foam setting on it but it doe not create a lot of foam the breville you could control the steam flow to get good foam i could about triple the amount foam from the milk in the cup the delonghi doe not generate a lot of micro foam any idea on how to get better foam with this machine i really do not want to return it because of the foam issue appreciate any guidance', 'sorry for the delayed reply but we have got some solution so first trick you could try is to remove the metal casing for the steam wand and just use the rubber tip from inside it just pull off and can be easily put back on you will not be breaking the machine second trick you could try once you are done steaming the milk cover your milk cup with your hand swirl it around and bang it on the counter a few time this should release some of the larger bubble and create that micro foam aesthetic', 'hey winnie that is actually an interesting question that we have never thought about because the milk is heated by the steam the longer you leave it in the hotter it will get so really it is up to you how hot you want it the machine will automatically turn off the steam after a certain time though so in order to get hotter milk than that you would just have to restart the steaming on the same milk we would not totally recommend that a at high temperature milk will start to break down however it will certainly get it hotter', 'hahahahahah my kind of humor xd double wanded cup gt let leave it up there to keep it warm seriously xddd', 'hi pam great question you can control the volume for the exact

zero in term of build quality and what you get espresso wise delonghi is advertising like the new vid with brad pitt and overall cheap machine really make me question their brand overall have had 2 bean to cup from them since my dad us those but they both had issue after 2 year after the warranty expired so that is that thanks for this great video definitely siding with sage breville on this one and will probably get it', 'honestly id take the delonghi any day of the week understandably the brevlle pull a slightly better cup of espresso but the speed and convenience of the delonghi is just brilliant it is not a huge deal breaker pulling an espresso shot on the brevlle take like 90 second total where a the specialista take like 50 60 second mostly thanks to the all in 1 contained grinder into portafilter amp built in tamping 30seconds doe not sound like much but pulling 4 espresso shot per day is 2 minute extra through the year that is work out to 12 hour of me needlessly standing at the machine tamping and waiting on espresso not including the extra time though if i have got family or friend over and i am pulling 4 12 shot for that particular night or the extra time cleaning spilt grind when self tamping the brevlle is a superb machine just not for me ended up pickup up the laspecialista for 33percent off', 'thank you so much for the review just want to know if the 15bar in the breville is enough to have a great cup cafeteria grade of espresso or is preferable to invest more in a 19bar model', 'let is face it the laspecialista is the winner hand down in the work place with a small number of staff simple to use much much cleaner tamper system much much quicker too it look great and far from cheap looking after a week of using the breville you waste so much coffee at the grinding side you almost need to create a daily roster for someone to clean the coffee mess at the end of each day still the breville is a great machine if you like to clean it after every cup of coffee if you do not mind this we will no drama', 'i would agree that the delonghi would be better for a small workplace if it had the build quality to match the look pressurized system will always be more user friendly in this price range and quality of espresso i would suggest going with a superautomatic if a workplace coffee station is what you are going for with people who are inexperienced with espresso in term of the huge mess you are describing a dosing cup or dosing full a you would use with any other espresso grinder will solve that problem instantly', 'i would not even buy the specialista at 50percent if i am being totally honest i would buy a gaggia classic or something similar', 'have to say i completely disagree with this review i am a complete amateur when it come to making the perfect espresso however i have owned both machine and the delonghi is way better imo the reviewer doe not touch on any of the key flaw with the barista express noisy failed solenoid poor temp control excess water leaking i am a huge fan of sage appliance and have lot but after my barista failed for the 3rd time i moved to delonghi and it is much easier to get a decent cup especially for an amateur worth every penny', 'many user are simply making basic mistake like not flushing the group head not fully heating the portafilter until hot before pulling a shot measuring the temperature in the cup instead of with the proper equipment these are consumer unit a lot of misinformation out there', 'i have delonghi la specialista thank you for information blogger my sister ha breville espresso i made ton of coffee cup on both of coffee espresso machine and from my experience i prefer delonghi la sp way better experience if you make late americano or expresso there are no

with higher end machine whereas this look the part but is really a repackaged version of an entry level pressurized machine and grinder thankfully this machine ha now been discontinued and replaced

why you say what you say but the fact is any grade expresso is possible with the la specialista if you spend the time in getting to know it capability a an engineer there is often more than one way to design manufacture a product to accomplish the same result and la specialista literally knock the ball all the way out of the park the folding tray for shot glass is something that make the express look barebones the chrome casing of the la specialista run circle around the cheaper appearing express just the opposite of what you are blind to see the integrated tamper of the specialista next to and compared and contrasted towards the express is like showing a roll royce next to a cheap japanese car like a toyota the latter having to manually do the tamping by hand perhaps the flintstone car and fred having to use his foot is another example of just how stone age the technology of the express is the steam of the specialista again ha automation and control overall the express may well have some different hole in it is filter but to travel 150 mph you do not need to have a ferrari a most car can still get to that speed specialista pissing on the express just like i piss on everyone who deserves it', 'a few month ago i got a bottomless portafilter with a selection of basket from amazon made for the delonghi la specialista the brewing behaves completely differently with a non pressurized basket and needed much finer grinding to get the back pressure up on my breville smart grinder pro i had to move from an index of 10 to about 4 this suggests to me that the built in grinder is not capable of grinding to suit an un pressurised basket some of our favourite bean just do not work with the new basket while other almost non starter bean are proving to be really tasty i have taken to matching the basket to the bean and when i have to use supermarket ground coffee i stick with the pressurized basket the bottomless portafilter is great for a bit of a spectacle but is a

ago had not used it for a while so this review saved to trouble of reading the manual love this maker so easy to use ha a good variety of cup size the coffee are delicious the only con is that the

machine last weekend and i never tasted such a good coffee if you like a proper italian coffee with a thick foam of milk this machine really doe the job it is very easy to clean and if you put the used capsule out in the litter downstairs the machine stop dripping everything on this machine is great you can easy clean the milk reservoir also put it in the fridge you can instal your size of cup differently so these are no criterion you can choose for so many different tast of coffee so what you want bitter or sweet i think it is terrible most people put so much water with coffee this look and tasted like brown tea to me and ha nothing to do with coffee my only critical point is that for a real cappuccino you need first to put a ristretto and after you put than some foam on the top normally with a spoon so the milk doe not mix with the coffee but this machine doe first the milk than the coffee wel most people will not mind but this is not an cappuccino it doe tast anyhow very nice and also go with illy segrafredo and lavazza capsule which to me are the best coffeebrands in the world', 'hi there could be that the cup size need resetting but also worth checking if the froth

many milliliter is the cup you used in the video for making a latte', 'hi there they are the 350ml recipe glass', 'ok so i bought this it arrived yesterday i am struggling i pressed the latte button

reset any cup size on this one but yes some of the drink size do seem a little crazy at default level do not they hope you managed to sort the problem out', 'please can you always give an indication of the volume dispensed so that we can select the right size of glass for each coffee type also an indiction of he maximum height of glass would be useful', 'the recipe glass i used is 13cm tall so

one after ur first vids after a month or so with it my only trouble are 1 the first cup is always like warm and not hot and 2 when setting the the cup size i do not know how much coffee and how much milk to use surely that defeat the object of having different option are not the different option just a different ratio of coffee and milk', 'hi mate yeah it would be a lot easier if they set the cup size correct from the start would not it like you say the different cup size are ratio of milk to coffee but also supposed to be different froth level too think nespresso recommend using the lowest froth level for cappuccino and highest for latte macchiato i would also be using the lowest level for a latte but would like an even lower froth level for the latte myself for a cappuccino 1 shot 40ml according to nespresso 100 ml of milk seems to work when using an aeroccino and barista recipe maker and the nespresso cappuccino cup are 180ml if that help to gauge thing a bit the latte latte macchiato recipe glass are 350 ml suppose trial and error and finding what taste best to you is the best way to go about it but completely agree they should set it right to start with and more info given a to what froth level to use for each drink can not remember if it say it in the manual though totally agree with what you say about the heat too cheer for dropping back on to give your experience', 'a great review but overall i do not think this is an improvement over the lattissima that i currently own in storage and replaced with delonghi cappuccino bean to cup machine the main problem is the temperature of the milk based drink and which are usually le than 60c once dispensed and not hot enough it seems this revision continues this and still ha the same issue with luke warm milk drink the temperature issue is something that nespresso are asking delonghi to program and condition into the lattissima range a their bean to cup version that i have dispenses a milk based drink at least 8c 10c hotter and at a more acceptable temperature but are both very similar especially in the way they dispense milk the temperature thing wa my main reason from moving from nespresso pod machine to a bean to cup and although the new range of nespresso machine do look great they still seem to have the same old too cool temperature dispense issue awesome review and very informative please keep up the great video joff', 'informative video i chose the citiz over this after deciding it would be better to get that without milk frother and then buying the aerocino 4 separate on a completely separate note what is the correct way to make a cappuccino with a citiz and aero4 milk or coffee first how much milk every single video i watch on how to make one seems to be completely different and now even this one is apparently milk first then the coffee shot i have even watched yours but i feel like i am just making latte in cappuccino cup', 'just to let you know i bought the machine yesterday mine doe not splatter milk and look messy like that furthermore i prefer the lattissima because it is an all in one machine and cleaning is not a big fuzz you can pour some hot water into a jug and disassemble the milk frother and rinse it like that usually take me 30 second my milk frother is outlet pipe is also positioned on the corner the presentation is so nice with the cup of coffee that i feel sad to stir it everytime so i guess the 2022 model is a much better range', 'i have this machine for 6 month now and it absolutely fantastic with no issue good to make a single glass of latte small and compact machine', 'i get your point about the presentation part but most of the time you will make coffe in a cup and not a glass so the milk splashing will be kinda invisible also i have watched other test video milk quantity issue wa not present and there wa not a much splash maybe yours is faulty', 'ok folk we bought lattissima one used off of amazon and it did the spitting thing everytime but once 12 time total i am a troubleshooting kinda guy so i bought a whole new frothing assm for dollar51 it did the exact same thing but i did not quit at the time we received the new frother we had two smooth perfect cup no spitting no hissing without milk froth perfect smooth froth operation so what wa it i went back to what i did differently and replicated it over and over again with both frothing unit this is what i have learned i prestaged the frother with milk and put the whole unit in the fridge normally i fill it with milk to just above the low mark setting or at the high mark work perfectly everytime also with no left over milk in the unit oh the clear flexable tube get pushed all the way to the top but i leave a very slight gap where the two round part come together my thinking is that the orings or whatever in the frothing assm at refridgerator temperature have contracted to a better fit hopefully you all get the same result i have in total now aprox 30 pod used without a frothing issue robk', 'coffee run out far too slowly and no it is not scaled up we have soft water infuriating it take so long the coffee is instantly drinkable

the lattissima just because i love the color lol but i did not know that those detail you mentioned were so annoying apparently for a lot of people but now that i saw your review i will not buy it', 'bought this a my first pod machine first time used it the milk did not pour but watched your review and realised thst i had attached the black connector at the back of the milk jug durectly to the machine and then i attached the milk jug to it rather attaching it to the milk jug first then attaching the entire thing to the machine rookie mistake no issue with a messy pour but my latte glass wa not a tall a yours and the milk poured at a lower angle a well yes it doe drip but once you know that you can move the cup away in time to keep the froth clean looking found the manual a bit tricky but did find that it said you can do more than one cup before cleaning a long a not too long between make your review wa very helpful but it only coffee for me so i am fairly satisfied with this model for a first machine thanks', 'if you drink mainly espresso and drink if that nature buy the citiz had mine for 6 year if you drink americano style drink buy the vertuo a it contains twice the coffee in a single capsule and is better for tall cup of coffee with little to no milk', 'the platform with a little hole in the top is there to mount your cup on when dispensing the coffee when you do this it will not splash all over the place i laughed when i saw you had a cup on the bottom and thought of course it is going to splash your review wa a bit unfair in that regard', 'if your rapid cappuccino system only produce a cappuccino amount of milk when you filled it up to a latte amount of milk you need to replace your milk frothing unit send the machine back to combat the dripping for the lattisima one machine flip the lid that it used to reveal the capsule holder a few time the rest of the coffee should drop nicely into your cup then get the last drop of coffee by using the rim of the inside of the cup', 'i think it is made for their brand of cup', 'i have had this machine for about a week now and absolutely love it the milk frother should not stop at that point a i have used it a few time now for a cappuccino for my wife and it is used the correct amount every single time so there is probably something wrong there with the sensor or something it drip quite a bit with any drink i do but i just leave the cup underneath it for an extra 10 second to let it finish when you wa making the drink with a glass of that shape i thjnk it would of been worth moving the higher drip tray off completely but also to note the froth did seem very erratic nothing in what i have seen with mine it is a shame that you did not enjoy it a i love mine i am using mine for myself a i am the black coffee lungo and espresso drinker and the milk coffee my wife is but she mainly is a tea drinker so she would not use the machine a i would so it kinda is a perfect machine for u a i type this i see you using another sized cup yes that is annoying a i got the recipe view glass and that is the perfect size for it you should not have to do it that i know but i thought i would mention it appreciate the review anyways', 'but if your reviewing a product do make sure to use a proper cup not a water glass', 'thats a real review the commercial video show the milk froth go slowly and smoothly but in fact is not the real thing i will not mention the mess caused by the milk in the glass', 'wash this glass for god sake lol', 'i recently purchased mine and must say i am very happy enjoying amazing coffee i use chilled milk so it doe not splutter out of the frother i find the frother super easy to clean i do that 1x daily take le than 1min under running water my friend who have the aeroccino say they have to clean it frequently a well my only niggle is that my latt glass almost fill over because of the froth', 'i totally agree with you thanks for the video', 'i do not like coffee pod not environmentally friendly', 'had exactly the same issue i could not believe what a cheap afterthought the cup stand drip tray is i think the cleaning light mean the milk container just need flushing with water rather than a full disassemble clean this is done by pressing a button on ours we had the same previous machine and wish we would kept it', 'i think the cup you used just did not work for this machine i have the same one and i agree on a lot of this but i have never had presentation or nozzle issue i just a shorter cup and it work will for me', 'this is not quite right i have this machine and the milk frother work very well doe not splash around the glass and doe not leave any milk left in the container look like there is an issue with this one i am very happy with mine', 'i have no idea why you would use such a large glass', 'thank you so much for this interesting review i wa confused what to buy but now i am totally deciding to buy the magimix', 'hi there i just got this machine yesterday it wa between this and the expert with the nespresso subscription and i think either there is something wrong with your milk component or the machine wa revised or

the milk is all used up and doe not spurt apart from the initial burst of steam the coffee is very hot which is how i like it using both the latte and cappuccino mode i am more than happy with mine i

those taper inwards and make the opening smaller in the top i will call it a user error i will also call the coffee mug try a user error it is the first time i have seen anyone using a nasty mug you got from your easter egg or similar source not a normal coffee mug when using it you should have have elevated it up to the milk spout there seem to be some fault with the machine too since it did not use all the milk unless you pressed the wrong button', 'maybe do not use that silly glass', 'who us a tall glass for that', 'that little thing which clip to the base is probably the most useful thing

experience make it more pleasurable the same tea blend served in a china cup always seems to taste nicer somehow than when served in a mug do you agree now it been proved by a japanese guy that if you behave nicely to water the actual crystal when frozen are a more perfect shape than ice crystal made from water that is treated badly so maybe there is something in it please see masaru motu on

uk we have moved a long long way from maxwell house coffee granule you must admit also l have no wish to offend anyone it is all personal taste and what may be seen normal in italy is luxury in the uk

tad on the flimsy side thank you for checking out the review have a lovely weekend', 'the truth review ok that doe not sound so good i wa thinking of buying this machine but maybe that is not such a good idea after all btw the lattissima touch may be the better option for your usage since it ha a larger milk container for more than one cup glass of cappuccino or latte machiato', 'we went through 3 machine before we got one that did not spurt milk all over the counter top however due to having to constantly refill the milk attachment if both me and my partner wanted coffee in the morning and the longer cleaning time all be it only by 1 minute longer we decided to stick with the older machine one of the other main reason is if we have guest and want to make 3 4 cup of coffee we can fill up the milk department just once instead of 3 4 time like we would have to do on the newer machine we also feel the old machine feel more solid and far le flimsy', 'i have this machine for 6 month now

and have normally made a black coffee cappuccino or latte the machine delivers milk first or not at all however i guess you could make a black coffee by pressing either left hand button according to cup size then get the machine to dispense hot milk a if a latte right hand button and then stop it shortly after the required amount of milk ha been added by pressing same right hand button again just need to ensure your cup size and amount of liquid dispensed are set okay on the black coffee delivery it should work in fact i will try this myself at some point thanks', 'hi anne thanks for your kind

fortune for their coffee they make it sound cheaper but they price it per capsule multiply that by ten and you have spent dollar7 20 on their cheapest sleeve the only selling point for this

independent review a always to be honest i still can not believe this machine is still part of the current nespresso line of machine the lattissima pro wa released in early 2014 a the top end lattissima machine with the lattissima plus being the main steam offering since the the lattissima range ha undergone quite a visual change but for some reason this pro model is still the same machine that wa released in 2014 and personally i think it look rather dated the other issue i see is that it suffers with the typical lattissima problem of luke warm coffee when making a milk based drink i honestly thought this pro model had a temperature setting but after watching this video it is clear it doe not what i can not seem to understand is why nespresso have not seemed to address this luke warm coffee issue that seems inherent in the lattissima range there is no way a milk based drink would be coming out of these machine at le than 65c when prepared and should be closer to 68c 70c to be getting 59c is just not hot enough and like i have mentioned in the past i have seen old lattissima plus not getting higher that 50c but classed a within specification by nespresso i am really sorry to bang the same old drum for me it is got to be a nespresso requirement that these lattissima machine can not make a milk drink hotter a my delonghi pain in the as to use bean to cup machine with auto latte system that these nespresso machine are based on ha no issue serving milk based drink at 70c consistently it also seems like the creatista range can be up to 10c hotter on the milk drink also so i just do not understand why these lattissima machine are not able to match the 65c 68c with milk based drink of the creatista range again the review is great and are a pleasure to watch a i try to decide which new nespresso machine to buy have a great week joff', 'what i do at home is i preheat my glass by pouring some water in it and put in the microwave oven for a minute or minute and half and then i make coffee of course i can not afford this espresso machine i just have a wacaco nanopresso and a lavazza milk frother', 'watching this video having a morning cuppa it look extremely stylish and after your demo it is a nice machine i agree for that price there should be a quicker heating up time and far more coffee drink choice i would not use the hot water at all but that is my preference i am interested to see what other follower have to say so nice to hear your wife is opinion thanks very much', 'e gibt mycups kapsel die gibts bei dm oder im internet und sind deutlich g nstiger bio und kompostierbar']","['nice review i just got mine yesterday and brewed my first cup this morning for the first cup it wa pretty damn good just remember to turn the steamer off before putting the milk container under it i did not do this and made a mess one thing not mentioned is the cup warmer on top of the machine i did not know about this when i bought it and it wa a very nice surprise having a warm mug to start is supposed to help with ending up with a nice hot cup of joe', 'love the machine too for all it feature ease of use water filler bean filler is excellent a you are not refilling after every couple of cup the frother is a dream no nozzle pop off and last but not least easy disassembly for cleaning true it is noisy dare say loud but the biggest con is that it doe not make very hot coffee or at least i do not see where the water temp is adjustable to make it hotter despite the you tube vids that show it not happening on my model esam 3300 big con when i add me half and half to me coffee it is lukewarm real bummer', 'if you press the 2 cup button is the result more watered down than the 1 cup setting meaning i need to make the coffee setting stronger if i am brewing 2 cup', 'i bought an esam 3300 based largely on this review and i have to say it is just a described a great little machine for the money it is easy to use and make a solid cup of coffee a nice purchase for anyone who doe not have the cash to spend on a super deluxe model but would like something a bit more user friendly than those express type machine', 'i do have it amazing coffee machine at the moment the grind is on number 3 coffee amount is on max and play around with cup size what setting are you using', 'hi gail thank you for your helpful review vids i have decided to get a coffee machine but am crushed between ascaso dream collection and delonghi 3300 ascaso cuz it is beautiful and unique and delonghi for it convenient super automatic feature i got ta admit that i have not made coffee by myself before but enjoys a glass or two throughout the day so i am worried that i may not be able to make a good coffee with ascaso espresso machine but the design of it keep dragging me back to it what would you do if you were in my shoe thanks so much for reading my comment', 'hey kev i appreciate the review there is not many of bean to cup machine that mete mortal can afford on youtube haha do you know how this unit compare to the ecam250 the dual mode steam wand on that seems appealing using the steam wand without the sheath on my old unit ended up causing some damage hence looking for a new one', 'in my humble opinion it would take someone with an amazing palate to be able to detect much difference in shot quality from one bean to cup coffee machine to another especially when we are talking about domestic bean to cup machine and not the far more expensive commercial machine when it come to the espresso side of thing they all use a brewing unit and an integrated grinder usually with very limited adjustment when you pay more for a home bean to cup machine you are usually paying for additional feature not improved espresso quality cheer', 'dear robert a you expressed desire to see the critique rather in comment than a dislike i will elaborate i already placed a comment under another video about gaggia and after i just removed it and thought of walk away just before i get across this review first thing guy like me wan na see is the time of espresso extraction max bean lowest water smallest grain on grinder a timer and a tared scale with a cup original sound so we can hear how long grinder work how long it take to make 30 ml of espresso max bean weight we get from product spreadsheet and we all set i assume there are not many of such people but if there are some this is might be a source of dislike if you have any gl', 'coffee kev well actually it wa a load of different part to sum it up it started with the hinge of the lid of the bean container then the little key at the back of the drip tray that signal wether or not the drip tray is in place and one of the mounting point of the upper housing gave way that last happened the moment i had to disassemble the machine in order to salvage the coffee grinder unit which completely derailed after a piece of the bean lid hinge dropped in to top it off the diffuser started to show serious sign of incontinence a well no aggressive cleaning agent were ever used on the machine unfortunately the drip tray alone cost about 90 gbp to replace so repair by delonghi themselves is deemed to be economically unviable superglue absolute patience and extreme care during maintenance will be key to keep the coffee machine running until i have the budget for a more professional espresso set up probably the delonghi ha a limited capacity i bought the machine on the 15th of april 2019 and produced 10345 drink mainly espresso with it that is just over 11 cup of espresso on average per day would that be too much for a consumer machine', 'yes there is a bin empty it each and every day a it tends to mold up very quickly humid warm etc a bean to cup machine need quite a lot of cleaning and laziness in that take down the taste of your brew very quickly', 'cheer robert yeah bean to cup espresso machine are not for everyone and if filter is your thing the precision brewer is definitely a better choice and in my opinion among the very best when it come to filter machine', 'haha thanks jim me too but a far a bean to cup machine go not at all bad for the money yeah sorry for the mumbly

of coffee when using the strongest bean and set to produce the strongest coffee though the coffee is nothing to write home about being not particularly hot and not particularly strong however the really poor aspect of the machine is it design with respect to cleaning it really seems to have been designed to make it cleaning a difficult a possible some of the used ground fall outside the removable container into which they are supposed to fall so the inside of the machine which is full of nook and cranny becomes very dirty the ground container itself is designed not to be easily cleaned and the drip tray is a total disaster of design seemingly made to be a difficult a possible to clean and then to dry not recommended', 'hi nice demo thanks im thinking of using this in my shop

review honestly it took a little playing around with the machine to get the strength to my preference for a true americano dispense some hot water in to your cup from the wand if you use the wand without pressing the steam button it dispenses hot water and then put it under the coffee spout and add a shot of strong coffee for a long coffee we tend to put strength to around half and cup size to max and press 1 or 2 cup depending on the mug size hope that help', 'joe varacalli at the manual i read when the machine is on behind there is a button on position i then on front if you press and hold the one cup button on the buttom you see red light thisis the temperature of hot water in scale from 1 red light to 4 red light in which you have set your machine check the manual if you wish',

red this time just use normal water no descaler and turn the steam dial all the way and let it do it is thing if for any reason that doe not work if the steam nozzle will not pull water through etc then i would take all the bean out and have the machine make a bunch of long coffee until you have emptied the water container your goal is to just make sure there is no descaler chemical left in the process of making a normal cup so that should do the trick good luck', 'one would think that a coffee maker this expensive would last more than a year without major failure requiring repair when far

gaggia accademia have manual frothing wand in addition to carafe based automatic frothing gaggia accademia gaggia babila another option are 2 newer machine from breville the barista touch and oracle

bought from the only misgiving i would have about using it are that the knob have no user marking which mean that if there are several people in the house using the machine it is impossible to select the previously selected individual setting also the time before the machine performs an auto switchoff is fixed at about three hour i could not find the power comsumption in the user manual when in

something much more expensive but seems like even a dollar100 semi automatic espresso machine pull out a better shot than a dollar1000 fully automatic one right the main complains about the fully automatic one no matter if they are dollar300 or dollar1500 is poor control over the shot usually more watery than it should be even when you choose the strongest possible setting in regard to coffee strength poor temperature often not a hot a it should be more time for warming up more water consumption overall not a big deal but no a nice feature either quite poor steam wand and therefore milk foam etc i would like a fully automatic one but not at the cost of a watery and warm cup of espresso i have little control over', 'i have the esam 3300 and i do not think you gave the delonghi a fair evaluation and would you please stop interrupting the brewing process you did it constantly on your older video the esam make a delicious cup of coffee you were much kinder on your older video', 'interesting and relevant comparison but having recently purchased the 220v version of the delonghi esam 4200s which seems to only differ on minor cosmetic point i think you are selling the full auto a bit short it ha 13 grind setting numbered 1 to 7 with intermediate position click the bean hopper is smaller than stated it is around 1 2 lb 200g per the operating manual the panarello can be removed a shown for cleaning in which case one can get much better foam with experience and skill a is the case with any machine assuming the dial setting on the display model and mine are comparable i would expect a watery coffee with too little coffee for the amount of water setting the water dial to 9 00 and the coffee dial to 3 00 would give much better result slightly over 1oz in the cup with around 9g of dried coffee ground for best result i would recommend purging the steam wand and then inserting it into the milk container push the steam button and wait for the light before purging after steaming milk and turning off the steam button i suggest purging the steam wand for a few second until water come out of it the machine is then ready for coffee in second it is not a perfect machine it is a bit plasticky compared to the gaggia titanium it replaced at home the water tank is small the steam wand only swivel and it requires some tuning to give good result the range of the coffee and especially water amount is excessively large but with some tlc it make pretty good coffee and work well the startup time is fairly short probably because plastic ha little thermal inertia cleaning is very simple it lack some comfort feature compared to other full automatic presets autostart informative lcd display etc but it provides fine control which some of the fancier machine lack i understand that it is pretty reliable hopefully it will beat the 14 year i got from the gaggia and that the internals are identical to the fancier delonghi model which make me feel smug i am silent on the 4 setting temperature control a temperature seems to vary quite a bit from pour to pour unfortunately hot water is delivered on the steam wand at a consistent 90c 195f but brewed coffee in cup

great entry level machine that is not intimidating to learn on if you do not know what you are doing so yeah i agree with most of what you said you have to keep your expectation in check a the thing

information on a saeco part and repair site all saeco pressurized portafilters have built in valve for pre infusion delay the operator doe not have to worry much about the fineness of grind or tamping the grind setting should be like the table salt grain no tamping is necessary the valve inside the portafilter prevents flow of water through for 4 to 5 second allowing the extraction pressure to build to the required 9 bar the 4 to 5 second delay allows the coffee ground to be soaked and swell allowing water to dissolve essential aromatic element in the coffee before extraction a the valve open up at 9 bar pressure the coffee extract drip into the cup a a classic shot of espresso if the quantity of extract is limited to 2 oz it will not be bitter or have any burnt taste because the extraction time is never more than 12 second it seems 12 second and no tamping is the sweet spot here interested in hearing your thought', 'gutti i do not think there is just gut out the whole original portafilter and make it a bottomless a ppf is nasty and unhygienic running it empty we see the water is always somewhat dirty and rancid from the accumulated gunk just unscrew the 3 screw

short of the screw hole', 'nicko persilion thank you you pretty much summed up my experience with it adjusting the variable give me extremely inconsistent result specially when changing the roast

a delonghi for awhile because i could not afford the gaggia classic that i really wanted i felt that it pulled okay shot but not great it steamed milk very well however i eventually got the gaggia and a really good grinder and am very happy with the result i get from it after a few week of experimenting so when you ended this video with the delonghi a the one that gave the best result i totally understood from my own experience i felt that the shot were not bitter but maybe on the weak side it also only came with the pressurized basket it produced pretty good crema if you can not afford a

compact plastic machine the drip tray will not catch much just scooping ground with a spoon from your large pre ground not quite suitable for espresso bag into the portafilter is a messy process actually recalling now i used to often get ground from my messy prep into the cup i wa pouring into however i did have mine for a while a year or two and when i upgraded i used it a a steam wand machine for the nespresso at work and for that the delonghi wa actually pretty awesome and much better than the heated milk machine aerator etc you could not get decent microfoam but it did find it is

nice espresso from my gaggia classic and a baratza encore with upgraded burr which everything together is below 400 eur before you give all that hate saying that the encore can not grind for espresso listen to me upgrading for a better grinder will increase significan notly the price of my setup and will not improve the taste of the cup a much the ratio setup price quality is not linear also the limiting factor in the quality of my espresso cup is my limited technique and current understanding of espresso brewing having a grinder that doe not allow a fine tuning of the grind setting made me learn a lot about brewing espresso i have learned how to play with the dose to overcome the not so great grinding right now i can brew espresso within the correct brewing time and tasting great also saving money in the setup allows me to spend more money on what matter the most buying good quality coffee so the overall message is upgrade your setup when the limiting step is the equipment and not your technique or your understanding of brewing espresso', 'i have had that delonghi model for over 4 year it is a bit of a balancing act but when you are used to it quite consistent my criticism are that the steam head is pretty useless and the noise and vibration is slightly annoying the vibration also mean that if you are unwise enough to perch cup on the top they rarely stay there for long that said i am happy with it and for the price i can not fault it it is also had four year of reliable daily use i am sure that if i spent twice that money on a better espresso machine it would be quieter and would produce marginally better coffee but for me the delonghi work just fine', 'one thing i did not mention is that there is another annoying effect of the vibration cup tend to wander a

to own the delonghi until the dial on the front literally popped off one time during use i wa not using fresh ground at the time so i found it wa only the first few cup from some pre ground lavazza

those budget i would at least wait for james to make his minimum recommendation the problem is that consistency is what is often lacking in the cheaper machine the temperature can be all over the place resulting in very different cup when you do everything the exact same way a a result it is really difficult to learn what effect a certain change like smaller coarser grind size ha on the final result if you want nice coffee on a budget i would look more towards pour over with a plastic hario v60 a nice grinder with available part like a baratza virtuoso and a gooseneck temp controlled kettle going 2nd hand on the grinder might also be worthwhile a long a part are available you can probably find them just over half the new price a a result they might need a new plastic gear or new burr but it can save you a lot of money if you are willing to learn how to fix them if you do really want espresso then it depends whether you need milk a dual boiler are way nicer for steaming or not and how long you want it to last i recently found a second hand expobar brewtus 4 pid that wa basically new and it work great i did consider going with a breville sage dual boiler but like most machine made with that much plastic part it doe tend to fail after a couple of year from what i wa able to gather at the home barista com forum lot of info there really worth reading through some of it you can expect it to last at least 3 year maybe 5 after that it will probably die and you will not really be able to fix it from what i could tell while expobar part seem to not be a readily available a some more luxurious brand like ecm profitec or lelit it wa good enough for me and at 800 euro i thought it wa worth it i hope it will last for a long while and i will just fix it myself i really prefer the idea of just getting something that can last several decade over getting another piece of plastic that i will have to throw out when the first few part break if i had to buy a new one now i would look at something like a profitec pro 300 lelit elizabeth if you want milk or an ecm classika pid if you only need 1 boiler alternatively maybe something like a cafelat robot would be an option le than half the price i would get the barista version with the pressure gauge at 370 dollar or 425 euro depending on where you live and it will probably outlast any of machine i mentioned above a there is very little to go wrong', 'jimmy spendix spent a few year temp surfing with a silvia it is honestly not much of a complication to your workflow especially compared to preheating a

put to much in the filter', 'i have had that happen i think it is because the machine can not build up enough pressure to brew when the ground are too tight', 'i have had mine for over 2 year it is getting tired now i keep cleaning it out i run vinegar through it work well for a while then it is done i think the pump is going but it ha been a good machine', 'recently bought one of these machine

appliance that imo doe not justify it is price you can get the same if not better coffee in some case from cheaper option imo one example would be delonghi is older ec155 secondly you have to invest in accessory or mod it to get the best of it especially a unpressurized portafilter thirdly at least for me it feel full of plastic and cheap fourthly being pressurized the grind greatly affect the extraction you either get a runny diluted coffee or you choke the appliance lastly while i do not expect it at this price point i would like to have more control on the extraction in term of temperature or pressure not just extraction time i know it ha some kind of low mid high setting but i would like more', 'i apologize not this brand a tengyi the imusa ha no pump us steam pressure only

success brewing with the advanced mode first i modified my delonghi coffee grinder to be able to grind finer coffee that worked out great then i tried loading that finer coffee into the pressurized basket but the machine fails to brew it it just pump and barely any coffee come out whatever come out is super bitter at the end i did not tamper the coffee at all just scoop it in and brew and it just simply fails to brew fine coffee i have a feeling the machine ha some trickery with the opv valve and it is just pumping and never releasing pressure completely pressing the coffee together and not letting any water through i have purchased unpressurized basket obviously i had to cut out plastic piece from the portafilter to fit it it is a basket with many hole on the middle but not in the entire basket like yours this wa the only one i found locally but it is not pressurized and that is the point i had better success brewing espresso grind coffee with it but even after many many attempt the quality never come close to the one brew with the pressurized basket on default coarser coffee the output wa always bitter you have no control over the water quantity only the brew length also i think the opv might have some special tuning not really suited for this i wa to be honest surprised it worked for you and now i am suspecting it is something with my machine i wa also suspecting my skill are bad and they might be still but then if you copy everything at least some crappy coffee should come out not undrinkable bitterness so i just go with the crappy machine theory not in general but mine i am a bit tired of upgrading it i also did the wand upgrade and i think i will step forward to a breville dual boiler', 'e gibt f r die ec685 eine pumpe ulka ex4 48w 230v 50hz

of use my setup is dedica eureka silenzio grinder i have a single bottom filter basket for two cup and original double bottom my biggest challenge wa consistent extraction at what seems to be that sweet spot for a particular coffee type i did pretty well in avoiding channeling playing with the right amount of coffee and extraction time keeping everything clean and yes sometimes result were surprisingly good but sometimes the acidity bitterness wa present that i could not explain i understand that there are people who might not have this issue and are perfectly happy with their cup of espresso from the single bottom filter basket on dedica i am just not one of them now come the part why i am writing this after month of using a single bottom re watching this video i decided to give it a try with 13 gram in the double bottom basket that came with the machine i wa surprised how good coffee wa and how easy it is to consistently reproduce the same taste compared to a single bottom filter and le messy even without channeling i wa too focused on getting that right shoot with single bottom and completely overlook double bottom i am using a relatively fine grind setting but avoid much force when tampering just enough to make coffee sit nice and clean inside the basket hope this will be of some help to anyone struggling with the single bottom filter on this machine', 'leider

my first ever espresso machine the 685 got myself italian espresso in finest ground at my local coffeeplace but the machine stop after 3 sec get no espresso trough to little pressure defect or do i

get a better coffee experience with your new tamper and have a nice christmas', 'chan chun ho dear chan i really appreciate your comprehensive response and sharing your experience with me that wa really useful totally agree with you that due to larger pressure of dedica and the smaller thickness of coffee pack in the portafilter the optimum extraction time is shorter following your suggestion i increased the tamping pressure and managed to get a 15 s extraction finest grind setting 14gr coffee brewing ratio 1 2 the extraction and the taste of coffee wa better i have ordered a calibrated tamper to control my tamping pressure for even better and more consistent extraction thanks again cheer', 'saeed miramini hi saeed i have been using the ec685 and the breville smart grinder pro for half a year now i am happy to help and i hope you can find some of the point below useful 1 the normal situation is 25 30 second for 9 bar of pressure however the ec685 give you 15 bar of pressure it is expected that your shot will appear like 15 20 second 2 the normal portafilter ha a 58mm radius with 18 gram of coffee however the ec685 with the bottomless portafilter ha a 51mm radius with 15 16 gram of coffee so your shot will be even faster since the coffee puck will have le resistance 3 i have tried using the finest grind setting and it chocked the ec685 and no coffee came out a a result so if you have a short extraction even with the finest grind setting you have to tamp harder you need about 10kg of force to make the coffee puck harder before putting it into your ec685 here is the technique that i am currently using 10 15 kg tamping 15 0 gram in bottomless portafilter breville smart grinder pro setting at 9 scale from 50 to 1 extraction time at about 15 second please let me know if you made any improvement good luck', 'arty home i checked the setting and it wa already on the finest it can do small improvement from more tamping pressure but still only about 8 sec for 35g out and face meltingly acidic i think i need an upgrade from the grinder that came with the dedica', 'do you think the tampering pressure could effect the bitterness also', 'no matter how fine i grind the coffee bean the quantity i am looking for get extracted much faster than the optimal any suggestion on the reason can it be the pressure i put when tampering i am still using the plastic default

stumbled upon that wa not present in previous type of coffee it seems that at some grinding level the basket get open portafilter get clogged despite coffee running smoothly for like 20 g and the pump

family is house and being disappointed both by the result and the friend is father pointing out that that quick discharge system into the drip tray wa a weak point he would replaced a couple of machine within warranty on which that valve failed and made a mess one presumes they have made that more robust by now but to be clear i am into modding my silvia ha a pid controller that i installed it is also easy to find vendor who pre install them last time i checked and i keep toying with the idea of better insulating the boiler and adding a pressure gauge which may be easier now than the last time i checked i got stopped by the need to drill through the metal exterior which i am fine with in principle i just do not own any drill bit that would do the job maybe i am especially rough or careless definitely careless once when i accidentally left it switched on with the steam wand open during a party and blew the boiler by letting it run empty but i have had to do some internal repair and part replacement that boiler swap wa the big one and i am not counting the necessarily frangible component the brew and steam wand gasket but i have had a couple of leaking seal along the copper pipe and in fact have just been using a french press lately a it is got one right now i am not sure that sort of maintenance requirement is a bad thing it seems about in keeping with what i know of professional machine especially professional machine also from rancilio from friend in the business i have never been a professional barista and they were modulo working with pressure vessel is inherently terrifying pretty easy repair that i did not think were excessively expensive', 'i own a dedica for almost a year now i wa not hapypy with the steam wand so i removed the outer part and only use the rubber inner part occasionally pressure spike would throw it into the milk but this can be prevented by putting a gardena sealing ring on it which fit perfectly overall i am very happy with it and for some strange reason setting i am happier with it than with the big commercial machine we have in the office a this one make very sour coffee despite 20percent robusta', 'key to gagiga classic for steam is to start 10 sec before light came on you will get pressure all the time and temp will be constant', 'here in canada the silvia is almost twice the price of the gaggia so it is a no brainer and there is a really simple workaround to get more pressure out of the wand you just start 10 second before the light come on i also upgraded to a vst basket and the ims screen which instantly improved the quality of my shot i will upgrade the portafilter at some point a i agree the handle feel cheap i think i am ready to get the opv mod it look easy enough to install it is a great little machine i am very happy with it', 'what about a video of this machine upgraded to receive a rotary vane pump we have the breville cafe venezia and the vibration solenoid pump is annoying

machine with no space between head and tray and will only take 15g of coffee in the portafilter steaming is slow a well mine is also mega rusty so need a refurb but a strip down and re paint would fix

really achieved the flavour i wa seeking but it wa not bad either', 'i trust you were aware that you can select one of three temperature on the delonghi dedica you may have tested on too low a temperature the other advantage is that you can adjust the size of the automatic shot i am not sure the same applies to any of the other machine lastly i always use a fine grind using the square same brand grinder and with no problem have been very happy with the result the machine is supposed to have a 25 bar pressure which i believe is standard across most machine i would be very interested in

the steam valve is a round knob that you turn about 10 time to fully open a handle with ball valve would be much easier it is loud i had to put foam on grate mount because it rattled like crazy the stem pressure seems quite poor there is no preset for volume or even time of shot i used to have a lelit grinder which wa absolute rubbish it eventually clogged up and would not grind and i ended up getting a cheapo breville which is infinitely better it took 2 hour to open up the lelit grinder and clean the burr to make it ok to sell it should not be that hard to clean something which requires regular maintenance the breville ha very easy access to burr automatic dosing and a no spill hopper the lelit had dosing but you had to hold the griphead against a button for the duration the coarseness adjusting wa also very bad a there wa no visual indicator', 'temperature surfing on the silvia is a must checking pressure and adjusting also a both wander around a bit but it is a great

ec685 while i wa away on a trip our old machine broke so my parent went out and got a new one solely based on the discount the dedica i came home from italy and i wa blown away by the coffee it produced it wa by no mean perfect but for the money i found the fact that it wa even comparable to genuine italian espresso to be astonishing the machine is been working for a few year now only needed a valve change in that time with a decent flat burr grinder and a non pressurized basket these i have invested in recently it make pretty good espresso while not taking up too much space the reason i am going to upgrade to something more serious is the fixed high pressure which make it hard sometimes impossible to dial in shot generally i would say it is a good machine especially for people on a tight budget or for those with fairly limited space on the kitchen counter', 'fantastic source of good information i have a gaggia classic pro on order so very excited to start experimenting here is a video with some tip for modifying the way the gaggia is used to overcome most of the issue mentioned by james a for the pressure i will be getting a new spring set asap', 'steaming with the gaggia a standard is not helped by the very wide range of temperature pressure when the steaming light is on the thermostat open at around 155c when the light come on but then will not close until the temperature ha dropped to around 115c so with the steam light on the temperature can be anything in that range i have added a dual digital thermometer with thermocouple attached to the boiler and the group head to my machine to help me see what is going on i have found i get the best result if i start steaming before the light come on at a boiler temperature of around 130c i then use the switch to maintain the temperature between 135c and 145c while steaming obviously a pid could to do this automatically but my modification cost around gbp20 and is completely reversible so you should be able to keep your warranty on a brand new machine', 'have a gaggia classic which must be 20 year old fit and finish is pretty awful but it work great and super easy to repair just did the pump last week gbp15 and 5 minute', 'do you have a link for the basket for the gaggia i altered the pressure in my gaggia using a gauge and altering the relief valve it is simply taking pressure off the spring that allows it to lift earlier but i work with pressure vessel for a living i also changed the steam wand for one off ebay which ha much improved it', 'not gon na lie i got a gaggia classic thinking it wa very good but a soon a i got a bit more into brewing i did a pid and pressure mod now the result are well appreciated by people who appreciate good espresso most of my friend however can not tell any difference and still believe the best coffee to get is at starbucks shame', 'doemi s it is cheap in comparison and this is espresso not just coffee because it requires highly specific temperature and

is pour over and i grind my coffee with a blade yes i know and get decent result but i know good espresso requires a consistent grind i do own a hario skerton hand grinder but i find the result actually more inconsistent than my blade grinder so i have pretty much discontinued it use outside of french press thank you for your help', 'colin wendt i myself got a flair a i am a broke college student and while i absolutely love it get really good coffee out of it and enjoy the process of brewing with it every morning i have the basic spouted version without pressure gauge or naked pf and all that stuff which add up to the cost the preheating is a bit annoying too nothing to write home about but a james rightfully said in his video the flair is just a tad fiddly if you got the money i would say go for the cafelat or the 9barista both excellent machine or so i have heard which look gorgeous will last a lifetime and produce awesome coffee and maybe more importantly enjoy the process

a regular cup of coffee startup 45 second and you are ready to brew milk you need some practice with all machine with a little practice the delonghi dedicate gave me perfectly creamy milk and very importantly i did not have to use an amount of milk more than just for my regular coffee cup size cappuccino temperature the brew temperature can easily be set separately each for single and double

fair but these day i drink white to sweeten up the bitter i tried to grind coffee fine but then the machine struggle and sometimes she just want to stall i didnt know you could upgrade the portafilter

you tested but it is still lighter than the gaggia we could not be happier with the new machine it is true we are not modders or enthusiast we have 5 min to pump out our coffee in the morning between

year you can vary the temperatur 2 c the pressure is very high up to 15 bar but it need some second to reach it high value so you can lower the effective pressure by stopping and restarting the shot

much thanks a lot', 'i have a lelit pl41tem machine i am quite happy with it the only thing i do not like is that a you remove the portafilter you need to hold the left corner of the machine with your

did not like this portafilter i start to get uneasy that i could still get a better portafilter than the one i have which portafilter did you actually recommend i do not see how there is a better

paid gbp90 and have been really impressed i feel there are a couple of point missed from the review and would have appreciated a comparison between the stock and upgraded basket a i am not convinced by that modification you can remove the drip tray to fit a larger cup latte glass mug and there is a basic flatter drip tray with rubber edge under the tray with the float the steam wand can operate like a traditional one of you just slide the cuff from cappuccino to hot milk you can also change the temperature and pressure in a slightly awkward menu guided by different timed button flash once you set it to your preference however it save those setting so worth an initial play with the setting just feel some of these point counter the criticism raised', 'we had a saeco pressurized basket

still around dollar500 and the steam wand is different on the 2 also without using a naked portafilter on the lelit thats an unfair test a for the rancilio it all ove the place with temp screw temp surfing and ballsing around with that get a machine with a pid like the anna 2 which is slightly le in price the reason you are getting better steam on the rancilio is because it running too hot a for gaggia i think your bias may have come through that machine suck ball no pre infusion no pressure gauge no pid do not tell me to mod it modding is for people who buy a car and realize it did not come with four wheel and they buy a 4th and think they have fixed the issue no just buy a car with 4 wheel duh also the gaggia ha an aluminum boiler which is a known health hazard lelit us brass a do most

steam then turn the wand on a the temperature build once it is giving out a good amount of steam but the light indicating it is 100 degs and heating element turn off ha not come on yet i start steaming and finish the milk ideally before that light come on that way you start at a good steaming temperature but the heating element remains on throughout the steam and your pressure doe not nosedive halfway through', 'i would give it to the bambino i have gone from moka pot stove top steamer la pavoni europicola stove top steamer rancillio silvia sage bambino plus sage barista express i would give it to the bambino the silvia requires too much faff with temperature surfing the steaming power is good but you have to purge load or water and wait like 1min for it to reach steam pressure and you have to make sure you start steaming before the thermostat click off otherwise the steaming run out before it click back in the tank is annoying to remove the brew temp is not very stable it doe not auto switch off i have left it on all day so many time and eventually killed the boiler a the cut off switch failed the bambino is just great it turn on really fast the steam is pretty much instant and powerful the brew temp is stable the steam wand auto purge which is just great for this reason i am keeping this over the barista express it tell you when to clean it it ha a water level low cut off sensor which prevents you from trying to pull a shot on an empty tank sage really have thought about nearly everything with this machine the main issue are the small drip tray lack of weight so you have to hold it down when putting in the portafilter lack of seal sound damper on water tank lid and drip tray so it make an annoying rattling sound and a poor connection from the solenoid valve to the drip tray so water always splash underneath the tray i have had far more consistent result with the bambino from day 1 than i ever got with the silvia after owning it for a few year maybe in theory the silvia could give better result with a fancy pant vst basket but otherwise it really annoying to use because of all the other problem and i am pretty sure not having consistent temperature negates the benefit of a vst basket and the smaller 54mm portafilter are also le prone to channelling so are more forgiving i really do not want to be temperature surfing at 7am in the morning it is bad enough dialing in the grinder at that time silvia wa great a few year back when finding a home espresso machine with good steam power wa difficult and easier than a stove top steamer but sage ha really pushed the technology forward with the thermojet system and the silvia is feeling dated considering you can pick up 2nd hand bambino on ebay for gbp170 it really is the best machine under gbp500', 'i have the delonghi i am new to the espresso making world so i am probably not the best judge but i am happy with it what are the drawback of using the stock portafilter pressurized i have just researched a little and i am even more confused my understanding wa that the pressurized basket is so that you do not have to worry too much about the pressure but in that case would not modifying the portafilter increase risk i do not think the delonghi machine allows for pressure setting mine doe not at least and while you can get a longer extraction by pushing the button longer it would not change the pressure', 'jeremy siers say not to let the gaggia steamer get to the point where it tell you it ready flip the switch wait 10 second then go in with your milk better pressure per him', 'owner of the rancilio silvia here modded with the mecoffee pid temperature and pressure controllability it is super easy definitely recommend this shot are way better a water temperature is more constant now you can also set a shot timer and do not have to manually stop the extraction you definitely want a good basket and ideally get a bottomless portafilter all in all for a household and geeky home barista this machine is maybe the best to have from a price tag perspective can not get close to a commercial setup cheaper than this', 'i actually have both the gaggia and silva i am finding the temperature surfing a key to learning how to pull constant shot it is fairly frustrating to pull an amazing shot and then the next one is confusing i think i will be looking

james i am on my second gaggia classic not the brand new model in fact my current one wa secondhand but i have recently added a pid courtesy of mr shade vst basket bottomless portafilter and adjusted the opv pressure to 9 bar none of it wa that difficult to do i have spent about gbp150 and the machine cost about the same it is made a massive difference and even the steaming is enhanced because the boiler maintains temperature better now i am trying very hard to perfect my espresso technique and using lot of coffee in the process it is a pretty simple machine and if looked after they last year

our un modified version ha been working for almost 15 year without a single problem it is quite sensitive to temperature meaning your shot can be ruined if you do not pull them the second the boiler get up to proper temperature when light turn off but if you are careful and turn off the pump a soon a the light turn on again we get great extraction the gaggia just arrived and i have been frustrated with the low clearance under the portafilter none of my regular sized mug will fit and you can only pull a shot for 5 6 second before the light turn off telling you that the temp ha dropped but a video i saw solved that problem if you click the steam button and leave on for 19 20 second before you pull the shot you get hot water during the entire extraction and the shot are pretty stellar we do not use either machine for steaming milk so i can not comment on that', 'i have the gaggia classic pro and overall i am pleased with it i agree that the steam power is a little weak but it work id be interested in a mod video on this machine to adjust brew pressure and a pid controller for temperature there are some 3d printable file floating around on thingiverse for the gaggia i

gaggia in the video over the year i modded replaced repaired a few thing the steam wand for a more flexible the rubber brew head seal with a silicone one after it broke and a leaking tube seal i also usually use a naked portafilter if i ever buy another espresso machine i would want the following additional feature a separate steam boiler a steam lever instead of a rotary knob a way to control pre

video on it to me it completely changed the machine i had found it very frustrating to use with inconsistent and harsh shot and tough to dial in with a new bag of coffee with the lower pressure the shot started getting a lot more consistent a much more mellow flavor like really really noticeable and better tasting coffee no more harshness or bitterness the spring mod is also very cheap', 'mason chamberlain the 9 psi opv spring is relatively easy to replace just need a screwdriver to take the lid off the machine and a spanner of the right size to undo the bolt that hold the current factory spring in and put in the new spring and retighten bolt it make the machine run a little quieter a the pump is not working so hard and i find the shot come out more evenly and gently taste seems more balanced and consistent on the shot a the shot pull at a slightly lower pressure for slightly longer the pid is a lot more work to mod but i also recommend it to get much better temperature control and stability the other easy mod to consider would be the silicone group head gasket a it make inserting and removing the brew basket smoother and easier over the factory rubber gasket that get harder over time and the stainless steel group head mod note some newer machine already come with the steel group head over the earlier aluminum head that wa stock on the earlier machine the steel head is heavier easier to clean and will maintain better brew head temperature stability too good luck', 'jrbaboon i invested in a couple of thing a competition basked and bottomless portafilter and 57mm

the 2percent area of your knowledge espresso shot a you said great potential with really nice grind i use it paired with eureka mignon and i could pull amazing shot with proper temp surfing which you

pressure wa really bad with the new one i am quite satisfied and still learning about it daily gaggia ha to work on their q amp a let me further expand the subject with gaggia you really need to be quick the first 4 5 second are really the most important part of the frothing after the initial purge gaggia is a wild a silvia in the beginning so if you air it out right then you use the rest of it for stretching getting godly silky smooth milk to get to that level you really need to know your machine and even if you are basically the most known coffee person on youtube you might face some consistency issue in the beginning also a strange part is that the steam pressure is not consistent and i have found it tied to some routine operation like purge wand right after 10 second when you start the steam heat i have not yet discovered the 100percent approach but still working on it gaggia is like a moody wife you need to start listening to her more see what she like see what she doe not and if you tick all the right box you will have a great time also gaggia is the most stylish machine out of them all at least this is what i feel about my matte black chrome gaggia paired with the matte black eureka throw in a black rhino ware pitcher and you got a really nice set great video a this will clearly help work from home people to pick the right machine for them covid 19 is the

and strongly considered a rancilio silvia used but what sold me on the anna wa the pid and pressure gauge it is also the nicest looking imo3 i agree that i wish it had more steaming power overall i am really happy with the lelit a someone who is just getting into the world of espresso making', 'i got the lelit without a pressure gauge for around 250euros a few year ago a my first espresso machine and i am still using and enjoying it it is a really good value for the low price', 'to get excellent steam power on gaggia classic you just have to practice a little temperature surfing i have the original gaggia classic and this is how you do it start steaming before the boiler reach max pressure before light indicator tell you it ha reached the correct pressure which use to take around 30 second after you press the button so start steaming at around 20 25 second and the machine will build pressure during the whole steaming process it work very well', 'right on target rancilio and gaggia are the best option around that price range i have the gaggia for almost an year and it is all true it wa significan notly cheaper than the rancilio at the time here in canada so i think i made the right choice a i drink pure espresso way more often i would be disappointed buying anything that could not handle at least that fine grind i actually expected the gaggia to handle finer grind when i bought the gaggia there wa an option to have a pid installed by the seller but it wa a bit expensive good entry level machine but yeah you will get frustrated with the lack of temperature and pressure control milk frothing can indeed be inconsistent a new basket is a must you can easily find bottomless portafilters to use a scale and bigger cup i will stick to it until i can afford a decent', 'i have measured this gaggia is pressure to be 13 bar nobody know why manufacturer do this i managed to screw it down to 10 bar it is much better now but i do not understand how basket can influence taste is it real', 'i had some problem with the gaggia is steam power but i have noticed that if you purge the condensation before reaching the full steaming temperature 10 15 after pressing the steam button you get much better pressure to use also yeah that tray is atrocious', 'i am in a strange place i bought a breville express and it work but sometimes it feel like something is not right and i want to be able to open it up and tinker with it but i can not i would love to adjust the pressure on the machine but i can not so hearing about a modding community on some of these other machine is very intriguing i may sell my express and perhaps get a rancilio also i wonder how difficult would it be to make an espresso machine from scratch', 'ed keatingis thank you so much for your really thorough reply there are some thing that i can look into for this which is great i am not sure if i am tamping too hard the grind is too fine using pact coffee espresso grind or if the pressure is wrong but i will give the weighing a try i have not found a definitive answer yet for the delonghi a apposed to other machine so thanks for doing the leg work finger crossed i get something better out of it doe the steam wand make a big difference to the milk once you have learned how to use it properly i thought that they needed at least 3 hole to get silky milk thanks once again', 'love your video very informative i have the breville barista express quite happy with it but think it is over pressured which make it difficult very even extraction', 'changed the steam thermo on my classic and now stronger and longer pressure', 'thanks for the thorough review james what are your thought on the lelit anna that come with pid would that improve shot quality and how would it fair against the rancilio and classic i have had the gaggia evolution same internals a classic but no solenoid and struggled with shot always coming out bitter burnt tasting very eye opening that you also confirmed this wa from high pressure debating upgrading to the lelit anna for this purpose unless you think a better grinder is a better investment', 'doe anyone have a reliable source of info for modding a gaggia classic for pid temperature control and adjustable pressure i have upgraded mine with a brass shower holder ims screen silicone gasket bottomless portafilter and classic pro wand but now i am looking for the next step there is some old info on gaggiausersgroup com but they have been shutdown since 2018 i am especially interested in wireless pressure sensor pid temp control who is done this already', 'not sure if you reply to comment but would you prefer one of the manual pump system rim or flair over the rancilio or do they not come close', 'i just got the gaggia a month ago overall i like it but the steam pressure is tough to work with the shot are quite nice but i find i end up pulling slightly sour shot even with typical good brew time and ratio but great value really overall', 'have a silvia myself and these thing are absolutely built to last i got it 2nd hand modded it with pid the modding process made me realised how over built these machine are they are so simple yet just manufactured so well with really high quality part i do not plan on selling and upgrading the machine anytime soon perhaps will do a pressure gauge mod in the future the pid mod make a world of a difference i use an ims basket a well and together i am getting consistent delicious shot out of the machine it not for everyone but it is a hell of a beast and beauty built to last', 'very interesting video for me a i own a lelit and i am quite happy with it question and maybe an idea for a future video about the lelit you said that the pressure gauge wa a big plus in fact i do not really know how to read it how i can benefit from it my espresso that were in the right timing were more in the 10 bar zone and of course if i am at 8 bar there is something wrong but i have the same information with the time that will be very short i am really interested in some clarification on how to use the pressure gauge thanks', 'i have a fully modded gaggia classic set to 9 bar psi auber pid a 3d printed slim drip tray stainless steel heat sink bottomless portafilter with a vst basket ims shower screen amp the new gaggia pro steam wand installed the steam pressure issue are completely remedied after setting the machine to 9 bar which only requires a screwdriver turn not replacing any screw or spring actually alongside having the pid with the auber pid i have far more accurate temperature control and can manipulate brew and pre infusion time it really is a magnificent home espresso machine once you have done all of these thing that being said you have to enjoy that sort of tinkering which is a without a doubt a niche category of person would i rather have a rancillio silvia no not really but that doe not mean i would be upset to have one either were i to upgrade to a new machine at this point i would be looking for something with a greater feature set which of course would put me in an entirely different price range and require significan notly more countertop space my grinder is the eureka mignon specialita which i like very much except for the adjustment knob which i wish wa bigger to allow for a easier time with minute adjustment', 'well you described the silvia experience perfectly without a pid i am regularly frustrated with mine and am still trying to steam milk properly after owning it for several year you learn to temp surf plain and simple and then wait for the pressure to build for steaming definitely a hand on process focused machine which will make great espresso most of the time if you learn the quirk this is the 1970 is range rover of espresso maker if you are looking for the tesla experience then check out breville sage well really a jura in that lofty price range', 'interesting but i wa hoping for much more information considering the pump especially also why not the sage duo temp pro still absolutely in budget but the larger machine compared to the bambino', 'great video in that price range the lelit pl41 tem could be picked instead that one is still significan notly cheaper than the rancilio and fit pid pressure indicator and proper steam wand love it', 'wa looking for delonghi dedica but i found out that there is a bunch of cheap semi automatic machine on aliexpress for 160 eur you can get awfully built machine but with pressure gauge timer and 58mm holder for sure it ha instant heat but seems able to produce 11 bar', 'dedica fit a small room or apartment very well and to my eye it beautiful and innovative im using this in combinatio with kg 520 grinder for 2 year and i am really happy with it it and very good value for money grinder pump lt 300euro it did faiil few time when i used a very fine ground from a nearby shop but with kg 520 grinder s finest setting it work well', 'well i actually have one of these in a way at least so i am able to finally chime in my machine which i purchased earlier this year for eur 519 90 would be the lelit anita or pl042temd to give it it correct designation it is a slight step up from the entry level anna that you tested the most noticable difference of course being the inbuilt grinder more on that later the anita also come with pressure gauge toggle switch a much improved steaming wand and a pid i had to add a bottomless porta filter distribution tool and tamper for the lelit is non standard 57mm design i did look into better basket which are available but have not yet decided to get one your vidoe will probably result in me ordering one okay so the grinder really is not that great not a surprise but certainly frustrating especially when you are just starting to get serious about your espresso in the end i gave in and bought a commandante which doe a much better job at grinding for espresso based drink the lelit grinder still get use for coarser setting like vietnamese phin drip filter coffee or the mokka pot though actually i wa not that interested in having an inbuilt grinder to begin with it is simply the only machine in this price range at least with a steam wand on the left side which did matter to me so doe it make decent espresso absolutely no problem frothing milk either thanks to the better steam wand it is still a single hole design but omni directional and well it just seems to work fine no issue regarding pressure or temperature either the other weak design choice which you pointed out are of course valid but in general it is a very capable little machine for the beginner mistake are repeatable no electronics to hide anything from the user and overall solid build quality it did take me two or three month to finally get to a point where i am happy with what i can do with it and the coffe it produce often far better than what pass a espresso in coffee bar okay i do invest in fresh high quality locally roasted bean too', 'have had a stock silvia for year now and love it it took some learning of the machine is idiosyncrasy before i could pull good shot but i now do so regularly got it for about dollar200 on the used market and it ha been worth every penny wa originally planning on adding a pid but never got around to it at this point i think it would just be a headache that would force me to unlearn all my temp surfing muscle memory', 'thank you for the great video i have dedica japanese version it ha lower powered pump due to voltage issue i have changed the portafilter to an aftermarket bottomless portafilter and it improved the overall experience significan notly not a high pressured a gaggia or silvia but the temperature can be changed to hotter setting did swap out the steaming wand to silvia steam wand which also made the milk frothing experience much much better living in a tiny 20 m 2 apartment in metropolitan tokyo dedica is small footprint make a great choice i have used breville sage barista before but is way too huge for my kitchen overall if one is willing to make few modifying and up their skill it a great choice if i had space then i would go for gaggia though', 'i have an old classic that like the pro can have pressure reduced i did but not tested measured it is a great machine for working on and modding fair comment about the steam wand i have always thought it wa just ok i would like to see a product like the classic but with twin boiler', 'i own the gaggia classic pre 2015 it is actually heavily modded now pid better steam wand upgrade to shower screen holder shower screen gasket basket and finally the pressure down to 9 bar i do not really do milk drink so lately i have been wondering about the diminishing return between my current setup and a better machine something like the profitec 300 how much of an upgrade in quality would i actually be able to see in the final cup', 'matthias reik hey sure head to shadesofcoffee co uk there a guy who sell the opv spring set to lower the brew pressure to 9 bar and pid kit for really reasonable price he is super knowledgeable and helpful and will ship anywhere in the world hope that help it totally worth the money i promise you', 'me too i bought the classic and i agreed with everything james had to say about it i recently installed a pid on it and a 9 bar opv spring the machine is in another class now with the pid you get super consistent brew temp and also massively improved sustained steam pressure id highly recommend it to all classic owner', 'i have an older gaggia classic i bought for 100dollar cad used i love tinkering and modding i have already modified the pressure steam wand portafilter and fixed a number of part next step is pid all the part are easy to find and to install there is nothing to keep you from running this machine for a lifetime which is a huge selling point for me in an era of increasingly disposable appliance electronics', 'gaggia classic take is spot on opv mod is absolutely necessary in order to get good shot out of this machine and definitely the steam pressure be something to be desired a there is just not enough however i think these machine last forever a long a you take care of them which is great and plus you can pick up one of these used for cheap which would give you the budget to add a pid get a new steam wand to replace the steam one on the older one buy a new basket buy a bottomless portafilter and just improve it and be at a lower price point then the rancilio however if i wa able to get a rancilio at a lower price point say dollar200 i would probably buy and switch over just for the steaming power because i make milk drink all day long', 'i am still using my gaggia classic i bought ten year ago modded with a pid to help with temp and increasing steam pressure', 'hey james in regard to steaming milk on the gaggia classic i suffer from the same issue a very underpowered steaming pressure and my heat indicator light turn off midway through the steaming process i highly recommend checking out this video it show the right way to get amazing steam pressure from this machine', 'this is a great video thank you please consider doing a video breaking down a typical espresso machine explaining showing the boiler the pump pressure valve etc and what to consider when purchasing maintaining and maybe modifying a product', 'i use the gaggia classic pro and enjoy it quite well i think using a naked portafilter and a proper basket ha gone a long way swapped to the stainless block when i did a new shower screen to help with temp stability but definitely interested in the pressure switch mod also glad i am not the only one that find it a bit tough to get a good roll while steaming overall good value and i enjoy tinkering a well a developing my technique', 'rancilio silvia owner here first year i used it a it were then i modified the temperature control not with pid however just electronic controlled relay thermostat way better control with only 0 1 hysteresis now the temp swing is around 5 total original thermostat have a hysteresis of about 3 but due to the small boiler the temp usually rise additional 7 10 a james proved often reaching 105 108 and also dropping to 93 i use a naked portafilter with vst basket the rancilio seems to have a longer deeper head so depending on roast coffee bean you could end up having trouble getting in your all of your 18g because shower screen and or set screw will touch your puck i have played around with different brew pressure and feel it is easier for a beginner to get more consistent result with lower pressure than 9 bar next step will be adding a pressure gauge great video a always james and yes the sound quality is usually better but you are excused', 'been using a 2nd hand gaggia classic 150eur for 5 year now it is better than i am for sure i lowered the pressure turn a screw and sometimes get great espresso the fact you can maintain a machine that is built to last is great do not care about milk thanks for the perfect click with the basket james highly appreciated jan', 'completely agree with your conclusion james i started on a gaggia classic early 2000s model and it wa great but lacked steam power needed the opv mod to bring the pressure down portafilter is crap so got a bottomless and a vst basket got a 3d printed drip tray that is skinnier to give more space under the portafilter ims shower screen but it really excelled with a pid all in i honestly probably spent gbp200 odd extra on part for a machine i picked up for gbp100 on ebay i really can not fathom why they made the new classic pro still to have what 15 bar of pressure and a pressurised basket leave that to a cheap delonghi people spending gbp400 on a machine either want it to perform like a prosumer machine or they want a bean to cup not these weird half way machine i think the new machine just miss out on securing a potentially massive audience because they have targeted it wrong i am not on a lelit but a marax i absolutely love it their higher end machine though all come with 58mm portafilters i can not for the life of me work out why they would not apply this across the board why limit the tamper portafilter basket shower screen gasket etc that you can buy it doe not make any sense basically there is a fair few good machine here but they are all stuck in a limbo for me in between being a gimmicky toy aimed at newcomer with low budget and prosumer machine that offer so much more', 'you should have looked for lelit glenda instead which using 58mm portafilter also in lelit you can do pressure profiling while other they do not even have pressure gauge', 'for people interessed in machine like these i would recommend looking into the quickmill series a well if it is available to you 0820 in particular or the 3000 which is the same in a full metal enclosure plus a pressure gauge', 'i started with delonghi dedica i found non pressurized basket for it and actually paired with rancilio rocky grinder if you did not ask too much like 10 espresso shot in 5 minute which we did quite often it provided perfectly oily creamy espresso i did not cut the portafilter though to make it bottomless that would be interesting then moved to gaggia classic pro and i bought bottomless straight away and wow much better perfect espresso totally possible my friend ha rancilio silvia just tuned up with pid electric v bimetal thermostat and it is a beast but still i think next big improvement over gaggia would have to be some hx machine or at least some rotary pump', 'back up the digger for a minute i have a delonghi and am constantly seeing the grind size for a machine is fine but when i try it in my machine it just dy and have to make the grind more corse i assumed it wa because of a weak pump but is it possible that it is the stock filter', 'i bought a 2nd hand original gaggia classic opv tweaked to 10 bar only an allen key and pressure gauge needed 18g vst basket steam issue can be worked around by starting to steam before the thermostat reach temp that way it keep the heater element on otherwise a soon a the stat kick in it loos all power not felt the need for a pid yet a slight flush before pulling a shot and i very rarely get a drink i am not happy with all in gbp180 and about 20 minute work', 'with the rancilio they have pid which can do both temp and pre infusion also i am not sure on how practical or effective this is but i have heard that with the stock silvia you can open the steam valve while pulling a shot to relieve pressure in the espresso which kind of get a pre infusion and then once you have pre infused for your desired time you close the valve which ramp up the pressure again', 'i will say that having a pid is a game changer i have a 2015 gaggia classic with pid brew pressure gauge and modded opv to be around 10 bar the pid can be set for your brew and steam temperature you can set higher temp got light roast lower for darker roast and higher to increase the steam pressure it fix most of complaint james had for the gaggia and silvia', 'i have the gaggia classic pro added a pid kit trimmed the opv spring to reduce the pressure and it now pull great shot the pid also improved the steaming feature there are also low profile drip tray being 3d printed that allow using a scale while brewing', 'i ordered a dedica and received it yesterday my end goal is to build my own espresso machine but first i wanted to order a budget machine at a discount price it wa only dollar150 on ebay and make modification to it to both learn how the machine work and get some hand on experience i have a much higher quality non pressurized basket on the way i plan on making the portafilter bottomless and i wan na conver the heating system to boiler so i have more control over the water temperature and hopefully i can upgrade the pump to something with a more customizable brew time in it present state it is really only good for mediocre milk drink and e s e', 'i would love to see a video in the price range up to 1500 then you have interesting choice to make you are on the bottom class of a dual boiler or wouldecent hx machine e61 group or for example bezerra specific group pid yes no etc rotary v vibration pump atleast my upgrade would probably cost over euros1k because in between the rancilla and the 1k budget there is not much in the market that is worth the money imo james might surprise me though he always come up with his own view on certain aspect of the coffee making process', 'thanks for the video james i recently upgraded from the bambino plus to the silvia and the thing i had noticed the bambino wa very very finnicky to dial in it required coffee to be ground uncomfortably coarse and the result with very lightly roasted melbourne coffee wa subpar i also found that it could not maintain 9 bar of pressure consistently and led to many very frustrating brew the silvia is a tinkerer is dream built like a tank like you said i do not mind temperature surfing or the fact that it is a single boiler after a while flushing surfing becomes part of your routine in the same way that pre heating the portafilter doe one last thing is that sage product at least in australia a breville very often go on sale accordingly the bambino plus is placed at a very similar price point to that of the delonghi in australia check ozbargin for deal it often go for dollar350 aud 196 gbp at that price point it is significan notly cheaper than the silvia or gaggia and for someone who similar to me want to investigate if they want to adopt a pet called an espresso machine it is a strong recommendation however for someone who know espresso know what is involved in making it at home i would steer clear away from the bambino plus if possible while it can make decent espresso it can not really make great espresso and you will waste of much coffee trying to get to great espresso that it will not be worth it not a joy to use and not worth the hassle', 'lindysellshomes i am almost the same bought a used machine 5 year ago with a new rocky and they have been rock solid temp surfing is not a big deal once you learn how to manage the temp it is no extra hassle i agree with james on the steam pressure i have blown the milk clean out of the jug a couple time when i wa learning how to steam', 'a a gaggia classic owner the milk pressure issue is much improved if you begin to steam before the temperature light come on if you wait until the steam is to temp it run out of puff before the heating element kick back in start to steam while it is still heating and the result are much better', 'a superb and brief group reveiw simply leaf the others behind the comparison on brew temp and brew pressure are spot on and ditto their steaming power bravo', 'are those niche grind setting with a nfc niche they seem very coarse for my gaggia baby class which should not be that far from the classic pro albeit with a pressure mod and a higher quality basket i grind at 14 5 on the niche', 'you are on about the 20 power up and on the comment above on the change to a bottomless portafilter and vst or ims basket one mod i would suggest is the variation in your recipe to a higher gram in to make use of the higher pressure from the machine i find that 19 20g yield better result for transparency of tasting note when not using dark roast because of my time with the gaggia classic pro i think i am more ready to spend the extra cash for a machine that give me more ability to adjust these input ie brew temp brew pressure steam timing and consistency such a model from ecm rocket etc and of course grinder are important so do not skimp there at all fortunately for me i can get the same or better personal espresso quality taste and art from this machine than i get from the local coffee shop in town using their local roast i am on this journey so i am really enjoying the experience and of course this channel for the wisdom', 'thanks for the review i have stepped in the world of espresso with the dedica a few month ago i think it give a great value entry level machine for getting known in the possibility in brewing coffee it ha some option setting that you did not mentioned like adjustable brew temperature and brew time with that and a decent grinder i think i got pretty good espresso it is all about personal taste using my grindsettings coffeebeans and unpressured filter i think the extraction are a bit different from the regular 58 filter because of the smaller size of 51mm after a while i eventually will upgrade this machine so i can build up my technique', 'i started my espresso journey with a gaggia pure which is basically a gaggia classic with cheaper more plastic part but similar functionality that wa 8 year ago and the internal component are still going strong it is just a dedicated milk steamer now though ever since i bought a cafelat robot last year also the gaggia is steam functionality suffers from not having enough pressure at green light you really have to start steaming at a certain point to keep the green light from turning on which will force the heating element to continuously produce more steam steaming milk volume higher than 150ml is a big challenge here', 'anyone know what basket james used for rancilio also james should have tried pulling some back to back espresso i find with silvia that while the first shot is great the pressure drop substantially i wonder if this is specific to the silvia or other machine suffer from back to back shot', 'alan interesting the kit i ordered which ha not come yet come with 3 spring 9 bar 6 bar and 5 5 bar it is gotten to the point where i feel i now need a machine that let is me play with pressure and flow control and pre infusion oh if you get a pid get one with pre infusion it doe not cost much more i did not know about it and failed to get one of those', 'alex lazaridis f i am not sure but it did not seem to do any harm so i left it at 9 i get the logic about the higher pressure for use with the pressurised basket but i have never used one of those so if 9 is good for proper espresso then', 'alan oh i think you did the right thing the spring is just another way to do it did you find an improvement once you lowered the pressure', 'alex lazaridis f i am tempted by the pid mod for sure sometimes my shot are amazing and other time they are meh had not realised until i saw this that basket upgrade are a thing i may investigate i wa puzzled by the spring thing for reducing the pressure i wa able to reduce from about 13 bar down to 9 bar by loosening a hexagonal nut inside can not remember what it is called or where it is and i thought that wa all that wa involved have i missed something', 'i think i have the same 57mm pid and pressure gauge i hesited between a 58mm or a pid more or le the same price and i choose the pid i am also very happy with it even if i have the feeling not to master it very well probably because i drink mainly single espresso shot i have read it wa a bit more difficult to make', 'wish i had had this video a few month ago although it probably would not have changed much i have a gaggia classic pro now and have already been looking at modding it to lower the brew pressure', 'drinking my morning flat white which i just made on my gaggia classic pro to all people who are thinking about buying the gaggia you can get more steam power for a longer period of time if you begin steaming before the steam ready light is illuminated when you do this the heating element remains on during the steaming process allowing a higher steam pressure sustained for longer allowing a faster and better textured milk steaming', 'i have had a gaggia classic for around four month now and it is a significan not upgrade on the delonghi dedica i had previously with the niche zero arriving this week i think that is when i will be able to give a verdict on the espresso shot it can pull but i have certainly had the same issue you have outlined such a being above 9 bar of pressure stock and the temperature stability issue with that being said i got a pretty good deal on the classic sold my dedica for euros100 and purchased a second hand classic for euros150 great video a always', 'adam mchugh i think the gaggia need some mod to be really good and easy to use fortunately the mod can be done easily and somewhat cheap mine mine ha a pid big difference a brass group head proper and beautiful portafilters i also lowered the pressure a bit all done with the help of forum and video now ist make excellent espresso i don t drink milk so i don t care about the steam', 'hi james another great video thanks my first espresso machine wa a quaha napoletana which i think is the same a the lelit next wa the rancilio which gave me many year of faithful service temperature surfing is a must for both machine certainly the silvia i have now moved on to the breville sage dual boiler and i am loving this machine temperature control pre infusion pressure profiling etc cheer from another melbourne fan', 'thanks for this video james i have had a gaggia classic pre 2015 for many year and have been wondering what the next step up for me would be i saw the new classic pro and it piqued my interest but review do not suggest the improvement are that significan not steam wand set up good but pressure poor my gaggia ha served me really well might

difference now about that modding community', 'i have had the bambino for 4 month now so far i have been very pleased with the milk quality manual steaming and programmability but have had issue with temperature and pressure the shot are somewhat cold and the machine choke if i use more than 16g of a relatively coarsely ground medium roast coffee also i have modified the pressurized filter by cutting away the bottom layer which pressurized the basket because breville ha been out of stock of the unpressurized double basket for month naturally i would have preferred if the machine came with a stock unpressurized filter but i hear that the newer bambino are now shipped with both type', 'i am largely interested in how you would modify the machine for different brew pressure i understand

decent espresso machine offer at least some control over the water temperature and doe not have a soft plastic water tank you would know any brand new decent espresso machine cost a lot because it would include rock solid material and technology of temperature and pressure control espresso drinking is a science and an art espresso coffee is tested first without milk actually it is not tested with milk first but you are just a sale person who display a total lack of knowledge of the espresso industry it take at least more than dollar1 000 to buy a decent machine without rubbery and plasticky material soft plastic and rubber cause cancer this machine in particular smell like rubber and leak rubbery smell all over not only because it interior is made of rubber hose and soft

still the coffee is not a strong a it would be from a cafe obviously you can get better machine than this one but i still expected nicer coffee', 'there are either 2 problem why this is occurring the grind of the coffee is not fine enough or the machine doe not use enough pressure to expel the coffee i am not sure if you grind your own bean but you have to make sure whether you do it yourself or have a barista do it for you that it is a fine grind it should be like fine sand if it is not fine enough then it will come out watery and sour and also i forgot to mention but another thing could be that the coffee bean you are using are too much of a light roast lighter roast are usually not a strong a darker one and are used for drip coffee or french press so if you are using a lighter roast i would suggest trying a darker one and finally the machine may have a pressure problem because if you notice it drip slower when brewing then the machine probably doe not expel enough pressure to be consistent i would try troubleshooting it from their customer service or maybe get a replacement if your machine is noticeably broken sorry if this is too long i am just a barista bored at 11pm',

that price range a lot of machine around 100 buck are shit a friend ha a 3000 euro machine and yes it is way way better but it make good coffee still dialing in everything and the steamer is fine once

people exist too so let u exist it just creates a really nice frothy milk and the coffee ha way more flavour than from a cupmachine which ha the same price i tried the real thing in a cafe and i always found that coffee way too strong which then force me to add way too much sugar just to soften down the bitter flavour so yeah do your own thing not all of u have killed our tasting bud due to everyday coffee drinking that we can barely taste coffee anymore and need wildly strong flavour to even taste something if you are someone thats more sophisticated with taste and look that swan one

others do you have a video that you go over what is needed to make the espresso a video for people that are new to this in this video you keep going over thing that wa not good but you did not say what wa needed you said at 4 08 there wa no gauge if there wa a gauge what would you want to see the pressure or the temp of the water or both is the amount of pressure the water is being pressed out into the basket important if so what psi do you want i have a steamer and it ha a pressure regulator switch in it i can turn the adjustable screw on the top of the switch to set the pressure of steam that come out there is a pipe that go from the tank to a pressure gauge so it not a big deal to add a pressure gauge and a adjustable pressure switch when the pressure i set is reached it shuts off the power to the heater that go around tank i guess when i am controlling the pressure in the tank i am controlling the temp of the water so i guess what i would like to know is what is more important

screwed to the bottom so following your video i tried removing that additional plastic filter but it made the coffee taste revolting every time however i ground and packed it with it on the difference is night and day the machine certainly doe not make stellar espresso but it make a damn good one for the price it just take a little playing around with grind size and packing grind size absolutely

the side also is inconvenient but in the absence of another one is good to have it come off if necessary everything wa fine enough a few day ago it changed i descaled it twice with no success and then i took it apart all the component seem fine one valve wa a little stuck so i reduced the tension on the spring a little calcium came out i guess the descaling did not quite work completely the acid dissolved the scale but even after two tank flush it wa still retaining some powder will test again tomorrow i had too many coffee today the sad part is that it is supposed to be 15 bar pressure but i have no way to measure it and neither the temperature of the water unless i just measure the temperature of the coffee that come out of it inside i can see the pump that ha an extra check valve at the end and a boiler no apparent solenoid but two set of contact in the boiler one definitely the heater the other not sure i am a tech but first time opening this kind of machine and with limited time i

basket high pressure and a pinhole is the formula for constant flow rate regardless of what you put in the basket it seems to me that slowing the flow with actual coffee mean a grind so fine that you

thing but i am thinking that even with a good grinder you are fighting against the law of physic it seems a pity they can not add a low pressure switch i can not seem to shake my skepticism that decent machine must be expensive', 'with the pressurised portafilters if i wa to drill the single tiny hole to say 2 mm pressure can not develop and i would essentially have a standard portafilter

me a a christmas present i bought a cheap hand grinder that is not particularly good and i buy my coffee from a local roaster i normally make an americano with it and occasionally a latte i do not have experience of using better quality equipment so am not used to the taste that they would provide however before having it i would buy my coffee from starbucks on my way to work or uni i feel that the coffee it produce is light year better than what i used to get from starbucks and i use in almost every day instead of going to starbucks so it is a lot cheaper in the long run plus i get to choose different bean each time i buy more coffee and i really enjoy trying the different flavour they produce so for me an entry level machine doe the job even if it not perfect and i would recommend to anyone who buy an americano every day that is also happy to get up 5 minute early to make their coffee although not one that dig a hole in the ground coffee in the portafilter a that would probably make undrinkable coffee judging by jame is reaction it is also proven to myself that i would happily make my own coffee everyday so now i know when i have the money to buy a better machine and a good grinder i know they will not just be expensive kitchen ornament', 'i am not an expert i like a good espresso but in bad circumstance i prefer a lousy coffee over nothing meanwhile i am convinced on

up a routine that get me some really nice shot 50percent of the time the way i get it is that these machine have so small boiler in order to heat up fast that make them really unstable what work for me is to overheat the machine and the portafilter by pressing the steaming button then foam some milk pour some water out of the portafilter in order to get rid of the pressure and then fill it up

part and repair site all saeco pressurized portafilters have built in valve for pre infusion delay the operator doe not have to worry much about the fineness of grind or tamping the grind setting should be like the table salt grain no tamping is necessary the valve inside the portafilter prevents flow of water through for 4 to 5 second allowing the extraction pressure to build to the required 9 bar the 4 to 5 second delay allows the coffee ground to be soaked and swell allowing water to dissolve essential aromatic element in the coffee before extraction a the valve open up at 9 bar pressure the coffee extract drip into the cup a a classic shot of espresso if the quantity of extract is limited to 2 oz it will not be bitter or have any burnt taste because the extraction time is

wa good coffee and i used it for a good few year at this point my interest and a little spare cash coincided and i decided it wa time to upgrade there wa a lot of researching balancing on what i could afford against bang for buck i wanted the rancillo silvia but if i bought that i could not afford a grinder so i settled and for the last 8 year i have been using an iberital mc2 grinder and an original gaggia classic no pressurised basket the gaggia ha had one failed part the switch flew across the room one day scaring the life out of me and a few upgrade brass shower head plate better

i can usually take about 3 try and then it dialed in for a while and i get good coffee for a bit and then it wont take the grind or the pressure is too much or it leak around the portafilter from the

me about 7 8 espresso grind step my first step wa to depressurize the portafilters but have since just bought a non pressurized basket from amazon that certainly helped immensely my next ideal mod

having okay decent for me burr grinder generally i do find drinking expresso by itself quite a sharp taste for me then when making a cappuccino latte i think it taste pretty good i think it is a good starter machine but i have had to learn how the machine work to try and get a nice result out of it the steam wand is a bit small and i have felt during the milk steaming process it can drop in pressure then regains it is power again halfway through still learning the whole milk art also but is it is fun and enjoyable still i am no expert but at this moment it is better than paying 2 4 pound

good choice a well but i think the gaggia seems more durable also to add another layer to the hobby aspect you can modify or replace the stock opv spring to adjust the brew pressure add a pid and if

from it wa meh it wa better for milk drink which is what i usually made i did not know what a pressurized portafilter wa until watching this but i think that explains how i broke my machine i actually

have been using it for the last 10 year never let me down a perfect espresso every time you want a good espresso buy the bean not the already ground bean is trail and error to find good bean high

fair bit larger so it played a much lesser role in extraction pressure i have tried using vitamin container a adlib tamper it is not hard to be better then those plastic scoop style tamper i think if

your large pre ground not quite suitable for espresso bag into the portafilter is a messy process actually recalling now i used to often get ground from my messy prep into the cup i wa pouring into however i did have mine for a while a year or two and when i upgraded i used it a a steam wand machine for the nespresso at work and for that the delonghi wa actually pretty awesome and much better

rabbit hole to mix my metaphor and gone for flair plus comandante that is what seemed to me a plausible answer to the question how affordably can i get good espresso the internet told me an aergrind

that', 'i would go with more at those budget i would at least wait for james to make his minimum recommendation the problem is that consistency is what is often lacking in the cheaper machine the temperature can be all over the place resulting in very different cup when you do everything the exact same way a a result it is really difficult to learn what effect a certain change like smaller coarser grind size ha on the final result if you want nice coffee on a budget i would look more towards pour over with a plastic hario v60 a nice grinder with available part like a baratza virtuoso and a gooseneck temp controlled kettle going 2nd hand on the grinder might also be worthwhile a long a part are available you can probably find them just over half the new price a a result they might need a new plastic gear or new burr but it can save you a lot of money if you are willing to learn how to fix them if you do really want espresso then it depends whether you need milk a dual boiler are way nicer for steaming or not and how long you want it to last i recently found a second hand expobar brewtus 4 pid that wa basically new and it work great i did consider going with a breville sage dual boiler but like most machine made with that much plastic part it doe tend to fail after a couple of year from what i wa able to gather at the home barista com forum lot of info there really worth reading through some of it you can expect it to last at least 3 year maybe 5 after that it will probably die and you will not really be able to fix it from what i could tell while expobar part seem to not be a readily available a some more luxurious brand like ecm profitec or lelit it wa good enough for me and at 800 euro i thought it wa worth it i hope it will last for a long while and i will just fix it myself i really prefer the idea of just getting something that can last several decade over getting another piece of plastic that i will have to throw out when the first few part break if i had to buy a new one now i would look at something like a profitec pro 300 lelit elizabeth if you want milk or an ecm classika pid if you only need 1 boiler alternatively maybe something like a cafelat robot would be an option le than half the price i would get the barista version with the pressure gauge at 370 dollar or 425 euro depending on where you live and it will probably

you have anny tipps advice i would highly appreciate it thanks', 'i have had the same problem with you with the default portafilter coming with delonghi dedica coffee machine the maximum capacity this portafilter get is about 14gr of not so finely ground coffee in the 2 cup basket i have tried with finer grind and wa able to put in 18gr of coffee but the result wa not being able to extract proper espresso shot only after changing to non pressurized portafilter i have managed to extract proper espresso shot with really fine ground coffee here arty home ha modified the default portafilter to fit the non pressurised basket i believe a non pressurized basket the one with multiple instead of one whole in conjunction with finely ground coffee is your solution', 'loving your video and i appreciate your workflow mine for my dedica is similar but i do not have a nice of a grinder so i usually do the water spritz trick when i load my single dose into the hopper because i get slightly worse static

upgrade to button lol same great quality without having to measure your water this keurig doe all the thinking for you i also love not having to put water into the machine every time i want to use it simple and perfect', 'i have this coffee machine it really for newbie who want to have imitation of decent espresso or latte cappuccino you gon na ask why so portafilter with this little hole in it it not producing crema a it should be it just a trick crema disappears quickly a it not created by water steam pressure going through coffee but through this tiny hole in portafilter the steam wand doe not allow to produce decent steamed milk with correct texture it also created for people who do not have experience technique to foam milk so it extremely hard to do any latte art tamper also ha to be replaced summarizing if you want this machine because of the design it really nice though to make your espresso better you have to buy naked portafilter it not so pricy on aliexpress good grinder that allows to grind finer than those market grinder for 40dollar or you can disassemble it change grinding to finder and usable again it not perfect solution a those grinder produce a lot of coffee dust which make coffee more sour there is not much you can do about the steam wand if you do not want to loose warranty i would recommend to replace it with classic one in general if you want just design and so called espresso it ok', 'hello just bought my coffee machine coffee grinder and now i have to both set the coffee grinder and the espresso shot i have been reviewing your and some other video in regard to this topic separately but never at the same time a both set ups are interconnected how should i proceed if i set the coffee machine without coffee in it to a specific amount of espresso shot when i add my bean it might be le due to water absorbance then for setting up my grinding i need to control the flow for x milliliter of final coffee in the cup so how would you recommend me to set everything up thank you', 'i got aluminum poisoning i do not use deodorant with aluminum my cookware seems ok i use a water filter for drinking water i have this expresso machine and idk if maybe there is aluminum leaking from this porta filter doe anyone know if the porta filter is aluminum', 'one thing aobut these machine is that the steamer always spit out water and this water mix with your milk i would say it add about 10 to 15 percent water to your milk also i owned 2 of the same non deluxe version they each worked for six month and then they just did not wife is very upset', 'after steaming should the boiler be cooled by steaming hot water out or can the machine let cool by itself', 'i do not drink coffee my family doe so i can make it for the however the main reason i am looking at this machine is that when i used to make coffee for a living i also used to make really awesome hot chocolate with the frothy steamed milk and this machine is nice and thin which is great in my limited space it more importantly look to make great frothy milk and only heat required amount of water needed for single use at a time i could also make a cuppa tea with it which is awesome given it is my main drink', 'i bought a new ec685 in january 2019 i had one older that i bought 3 year ago but the pump gave up 3 year wa ok a i usually make 7 double shot a day i think the best advantage with my new one not shown in this video are the coffee filter now made up of 2 part the perforated filter that can be removed from the part with the one small hole for pressurizing this make it easier to check clogging in the perforated filter and the other part just hold up the part to a light window and you will observe any clogging use a needle a described in the manual to avoid clogging i also place a small round piece of filter paper that i cut out from normal melitta filter to perfectly fit the bottom of the perforated part one melitta filter give me 14 small piece and i cut 4 filter at the same time which is pretty fast and i now have 56 piece to further avoid clogging i weekly clean the filter by putting a 1 3 tsp of baking soda in the filter basket and run 2 3 water shot and then rinse the part a mentioned this is pressurized system but it would be very easy to make it a non pressurized system just drilling the one small hole to open it further i will try on the 1 shot filter to see how it work', 'for what a stranger on the internet opinion worth you would struggle to pull it off due to the temperature fluctuation between steam wand and espresso with this machine due it single boiler you will have inconsistent shot if selling latte and cappuccino and if you plan on making any quantity of espresso the water will be quick to overheat and it wont be so great the pressurised portafilter while convenient will not give you the kind of shot that a dedicated grinder fresh bean and correct grind size and extraction will you will be far more suited to aim for something in the prosumer market instead with a dual boiler coupled with a good quality grinder use the rancillio rocky a a point of reference if you any question i am happy to help just pop

steam i do not know what o have to do with brand new dedica', 'hi guy fun review loved it i went and bought the dedica after seeing the review i like it so far but the amount of coffee it give is tiny i know it is espresso but come on you say in the video that the button are programmable but i think it is only for temperature and water hardness can the amount of coffee be programmed i have to press twice on the middle button to fill my cup thank you great channel', 'is there any kind of water filter softener to place in the water tank for this machine', 'the manual read that there is one you can buy from delonghi there is a spot for it in the tank', 'do not think so i just use mineral water a i live in an area with very hard water the descaling alarm is basically just a counter that trigger after a certain number of us i think i pretty much ignore it now', 'go coarser with your grind the breville say a certain range is espresso but that is just a guideline also with the pressurized basket be very careful with fine grind there is only one hole on the bottom of many style of pressurized basket and it can be easily clogged with fine coffee grind soak your basket overnight in very hot water with cafiza powder dissolved and try brewing with the grind set to a notch or two coarser than you are using now', 'i would not rush out and buy the upgraded machine i have the original and it is not drastically different tamper you can get one amazon for around five pound 51mm otherwise it pretty much do is what it say and it make a pretty decent cup of coffee for the money only thing i would add is you a cup or something for when you put the steamer on a you get a squirt of water before it start to steam', 'hi gail great review i have this machine but my coffee come out tasting very watery what am i doing wrong could it be something with the water teperature keep up the good work cheer from sweden', 'the manual mention that an excess of water under the tank would be normal and should be dried up when needed', 'de gustibus non est disputandum in matter of taste there can be no dispute it is a matter of personal preference some like the way french press produce the body some like it better with siphon but to me i like how aeropress creates the body it feel bolder and with metal filter it taste richer than paper filter but when i want a thinner body or le stronger taste i felt pour over can delivers i think it come down on how the contraption work pour over have some what le contact with the grind a the water pass through and for the press well it press the grind and

cycle', 'you totally waited too long to pull your steam instead of resetting the machine you can pull hot water to come down from steam temp to brewing temp that is what happened smooth play off though someone who doe not drink 6 cup a day for the past 5 year form this machine will not notice a thing', 'yes just brew the espresso in a mug then add water', 'you could use the nozzle to boil water into a cup with a tea bag in it', 'after frothing the milk you can not make espresso immediately if the 2 espresso button are flashing a it indicates that the boiler is too hot and the machine will not let you to prevent burning the coffee all you need to you is to turn the steam dial and let it cool down you will know it is ready when it is no longer ejecting water', 'you can preprogram

watching tutorial and finally fixed my problem now my espresso is perfect and better than anything i tasted before at any coffee shop now i did many thing such a buying proper grinder non pressurized filter proper coffee and the same tamper he us but before doing all of that i learned one technique that you can try right away and it might just work without all other thing i learned that there must be a space between coffee level and the top screen from where water come out i always thought that coffee should touch that screen and loaded the filter a such that wa a big mistake if you think that you may also load too much try loading le and compress harder test your load lock it into position and remove do you see any scratch on the coffee surface are there any coffee grind on the metal screen of the machine if yes then you are loading too much apparently it is important that water fill the empty space called headroom first and then start sipping through compression is very important press hard and make sure it is levelled watch some video how to press properly these two thing headroom and proper compression should make a big difference adding all other thing i mentioned will elevate it to all new level', 'mine doe not produce any crema i did read the manual adjust the temp setting primed the machine by releasing 100ml of water through the nozzle and made more than 5

come out and apply more compression there must be a space between coffee and the top screen called headroom up to 3 mm is recommended the level in his video is pretty good proper compression is also very important this should make a big difference', 'i just got my machine i am not sure is my mine have problem or is just how it is i weighted my milk after steam it will have 20g more after that i found out the steamer spay some water out while i steaming the milk is it normal or something wrong with my machine', 'goattoaster i let some water out before steam but still have some water let out', 'i am not sure exactly how much it let out but initially it doe let out a bit of water while clearing the steam pipe my method is to let the machine heat up for steam then release a little bit of steam into an empty glass first to clear out that water then you can use it a normal and it will not let out a much water into your milk hope that help', 'i have this machine since december but not it doe not have enough pressure or something else is going on that is not pouring like when it wa new i have discale it 3 time and also i live in nyc and the water is good i am almost putting it in the garbage and get a breville', 'are you getting a good flow i have had that issue when i put too much ground coffee in or pack it too tight also for an americano i brew the espresso into a mug and top with hot water', 'it will be a heat thing the machine would rather disable the steam wand then just shoot subcritical water into your milk', 'jcosk8 i think that is what i saw him do i usually do a quick release of course when you do that some water is going to come out before the steam it is just purging a bit of the line anyway it is all good i love my machine and it ha not really been a big issue', 'anthony according to the manual you should position an empty container under the cappuccino maker and open the dial for a few second to eliminate any air left in the circuit close the dial again so you should not draw any water just make sure there is no air caught up in the tube this is very different from the instruction for cooling the machine to make coffee again to make coffee again immediately after frothing milk the boiler must first be cooled or the coffee will be burnt proceed a follows place a container under the cappuccino maker open the steam dial to deliver hot water and cool the boiler you only need to draw hot water when you want the temp to go down to coffee making level if you draw water before wanting to use steam you are basically cooling down the machine before you start it make no sense', 'jcosk8 i think he is doing it correctly he first draw it down to release some of the residual water that is how it is explained in the instruction manual a well i understand that if you continue to draw water it will cool down the boiler so that you can make espresso again i think he is right in that it is not the strongest heating element so you have to let it warm up for a few minute i also have my toaster plugged in to the same outlet i do not know if that make a difference', 'do you do it like him if so it is wrong the down position is to draw water and bring the temp down so you can brew coffee after steaming milk if you draw water and bring the heat down then it stop midway in the steaming if you do it correctly it should not stop you will actually have to cool it down to continue using it for coffee', 'i got aluminum poisoning i do not use deodorant with aluminum my cookware seems ok i use a water filter for drinking water i have this expresso machine and idk if maybe there is aluminum leaking from this porta filter doe anyone know if the porta filter is aluminum', 'jj shankles thanks a lot for your reply you are absolutely right in my case since this is my first espresso machine i grind the coffee too fine which created pressure and water through coffee filter could not pas through well i left the machine for 6 hour but still took a little more force to release the handle the next shot wa much better a the coffee wa medium grind', 'sai peri hi i have had this machine for 5 year zero issue used 1 3 time per day i can say most issue with people that think they have a leak is that they filled the water reservoir up to far it will drip out the bottom pump ha been flawless any issue with flow had been i put to much in the filter', 'haha you fucked up the milk with water i use a thermometer and i stop at 60 degree since this appliance is weak you do not have to move the mug that much it is not a real machine it can not make latte art either with or without milk your espresso look disgusting there is no crema at all i have this appliance for two year now at first i wa very excited figuring i wa upgrading from stove espresso pot big change however after 2 month it started to piss me off the portafilter wa just dripping and the taste wa bitter watery and undrinkable breville appliance stand in the same category this quality level doe not offer any stability in heat or quality it is pressurized basket coffee not a real espresso machine it is a fake espresso it will never get a close a a great

wrong the mode that you use is to cool down the machine after foaming that by no mean is the machine overheating this is used after foaming up milk to be able to pull a espresso this mode run water thru the boiler to cool it down since espresso is made at a way lower temperature than the steam', 'recently bought one of these machine it worked twice then went wrong it did not produce enough pressure for the water to flow the coffee got a refund', 'you probably packed it too much so the water then can not flow through the ground', 'tua tua were using the single shot i am having the same issue only a little dribble of water come through the coffee', 'i noticed that by turning the foam handle more in hot water function the pump start to run what doe it change', 'hello dev i have the same sometimes i hold the machine when putting in the filter holder check if you do not use to much coffee in the filter i clean my filter under the water tap', 'i am not sure what im doing wrong how do you increase extraction time mine take about 5 second and there is a very quick flow of water initially the liquid is a bit brown but then it is very watery i usually fill the filter a much a you do but it it really feel a if the extract is not particularly strong', 'hi felixonwater i have the one hole wand', 'why doe mine turn out watery and ha no crema', 'you should not tamp coffe in home

and it produce wet steam even afer purging the condensation water it add about 18 ml of water into 150 180 ml milk steamed any help or thought thank you', 'that wa awful just from looking at the shot the grind doe not look fine enough or the coffee bean are not great is under extracted the initial pour should be much darker and thicker another indicator is the lack of any of proper crema you just have a bit of foam why on earth would you stop the shot then add more water that extra pre infusion and water would make your most definitely sour shot taste even worse just set your single espresso shot to run a bit longer if you want a bit more water', 'delonghi bco320 i wa very sorry to deal with this company that doe not respect it product nor it customer since i bought an espresso machine

machine now at your agent in jordan from more than three month and i received nothing from them put promise', 'very nice vid but for my machine it real quick for cool down blinking started after i purge out some water from the wand so i need to purge again n reselect the steam option could you help', 'long time dedica user here here are a couple of tip not mentioned or fully explained in the video 1 absolutely do get the proper non pressurised basket you can get it on amazon or elsewhere either with the whole portafilter or just the basket warning the default delonghi portafilter ha a plastic part inside that prevents inserting a deeper proper non pressurised basket but with a little patience and a hacksaw you can simply cut a centimetre or so from the plastic part to make everything fit so you will be able to continue using the default portafilter p ka the pressurised basket allows you to brew essentially anything but you have very little control over brew time in this video they were quite lucky to get something espresso like in most case you will struggle to square a circle it will either choke or brew too quick or you will get inconsistent random result so definitely get the non pressurised basket 2 the button are programmable just push and keep pressing it for the desired length of time it will then remember how long you pressed it very useful when dialling in new coffee just settle on the right dose and grind size get the time right 25 30 s and next time you will get the same result consistently 3 use darker roast look guy i know we are all fan of the light roasted hipster coffee here but this machine can not extract them properly sorry for the allcaps but this point need stressing i learnt it the hard way so perhaps you will not have to if a specialty coffee roastery in czechia and abroad tell you oh do not worry our espresso roast is perfect for home machine they are lying to you it is still way too light roasted to be extracted well by dedica you see the machine doe not really produce high enough temperature even if you set see the manual the water temp to max i remember reading it only get to about 86 c which is simply too low for proper extraction of what modern roaster call espresso or medium roast what you will get will be intensely sour and unpleasant at least to my palate without sugar on the other hand if you use something more traditional doe not have to be very dark just darker than what most specialty coffee roaster usually offer you will get a quite pleasant traditional espresso thick creamy not too bitter not sour sometimes quite sweet i found that brazilian coffee usually work the best with this machine in short look for more developed roast with low acidity 4 steaming milk the wand ha 2 setting use them you can really produce quite acceptable microfoam if you start with the cappuccino setting get some air in and then switch to hot milk to get that vortex swirling going that produce very fine foam it take a bit of practice but it is not hard watch some video on general tip for milk steaming after you finish clean the wand and then you will have to open the valve again to let off the excess heat steam so that the machine return to the normal coffee brewing setting 5 comandante grinder setting naturally this will depend heavily on the coffee bean and dose you are using i only use non pressurised deeper basket and my dose is usually between 17 19 gram the corresponding comandante c40 setting are usually between 7 10 click finer for darker roast coarser for lighter roast be careful not to choke it machine totally you might rupture the o ring in the grouphead it can be easily replaced but be extra careful not to tear the thread on the screw the bed is made of plastic and it can easily happen a you try to tighten it then it will not hold the shower screen properly and the o ring will keep popping out replacing the plastic part is quite a pain in the as for the non mechanic like me so be aware', 'hi great video i have the same 2 question can you share the exact name diameter of the portafilter you used and sometimes after pressing the button the water is stuck inside and nothing come out know why thanks', 'nar2086 i did try the ro water with scot is mineral profile my best guess is the temp', 'suba yes and yes before pulliing in put two shot of water through', 'if you allow me try using different water if you have not tried that', 'hi really good video thanks i have the same machine but i had little to no success brewing with the advanced mode first i modified my delonghi coffee grinder to be able to grind finer coffee that worked out great then i tried loading that finer coffee into the pressurized basket but the machine fails to brew it it just pump and barely any coffee come out whatever come out is super bitter at the end i did not tamper the coffee at all just scoop it in and brew and it just simply fails to brew fine coffee i have a feeling the machine ha some trickery with the opv valve and it is just pumping and never releasing pressure completely pressing the coffee together and not letting any water through i have purchased unpressurized basket obviously i had to cut out plastic piece from the portafilter to fit it it is a basket with many hole on the middle but not in the entire basket like yours this wa the only one i found locally but it is not pressurized and that is the point i had better success brewing espresso grind coffee with it but even after many many attempt the quality never come close to the one brew with the pressurized basket on default coarser coffee the output wa always bitter you have no control over the water quantity only the brew length also i think the opv might have some special tuning not really suited for this i wa to be honest surprised it worked for you and now i am suspecting it is something with my machine i wa also suspecting my skill are bad and they might be still but then if you copy everything at least some crappy coffee should come out not undrinkable bitterness so i just go with the crappy machine theory not in general but mine i am a bit tired of upgrading it i also did the wand upgrade and i think i will step forward to a breville dual boiler', 'd niel bulyovcsity i know this might sound weird but have you cleaned the sieve where the water come out of the appliance mine had a blockage last year that made the coffee taste funny', 'i also had this delonghi coffee appliance it is not a machine at this price point and also the grinder i did not mod it but used it at 3 5 based on the coffee if the grind is too fine the appliance basically choke because it try to push water through a plug with a very small point and it can not do that a such you are overbrewing and from there you get the bitterness oh and also the delonghi grinder is not the most consistent one for espresso it might be for french press or pour over but not for espresso now you have 3 option either continue with the pressurized basket and decrease the amount of coffee and increase the grind setting until you find a setting you like setting on a coffee or go non pressurized but with a different portafilter see aliexpress for 51mm bottomless portafilters and again find a setting you like or the third more expensive option upgrade the grinder to a better one imo first come the coffee bean then the grinder and finally the espresso appliance machine i have the baratza encore but i would have gone honestly with either a manual good grinder or save up a bit for a better espresso grinder like the lelit pl 043 fred', 'hey i am still interested in what your setting for temperature and water hardness were', 'hey a i mentioned always the highest temperature is the best with this type of machine water hardness depending on the water you use', 'e gibt f r die ec685 eine pumpe ulka ex4 48w 230v 50hz mit 18bar alle anschl sse sind identisch einfach austauschen viel mehr druck ist

temperatur in the kettle and can easily work your way up to a good shot by adjusting the different parameter grind temperatur time etc i got mine new for 390euros i think you get good value for your

broken well you can throw it away a much a i love it here are some con for those of you that consider buying the lelit like james already mentioned the steam isn t a powerful and also pretty watery but with a small single circle mashine you ll never get that good steam but it seems lile the rancilio doe better here the water tank it ha a strange odor to it after a while and the opening is pretty unhandy do get water in without spilling and also almost impossible to clean properly the new one have a better tank with a big opening i think almost every anna owner changed the tank into a glas vase or another plastic tank i did cut a bigger hole in it you can only see the water level in the tank from one side unhandy if you need to place it next to a wall the portafilter doesn t slide in too well so you got ta hold it while putting it in o think that d different from machine to machine and i guess it s because the tolerance while building aren t that high on this part the first two machine i ordered were scratched really badly in this area the drip tray itself is a bit wobbly cause of the design the drip tray grid doesn t habe enough hole in it too much metal cover if you wan na steam in the drip tray after steaming mill it really make a mess cause of the watery steam hitting the metal grid u get used to it and either steam in a glass or a towl or place it directly above a hole the top part aka cup warmer doesn t really get that hot the tamper it come with is just a cheap plastic thing u can t use the single espresso portafilter don t know the proper name somehow me and a lot of other people can t get good shot with it but that s also a common problem not only with lelit sorry if my grammar etc is wrong i m from germany', 'i had the delonghi we had planned on moving

mine bought one a part of a return pallet deal from amazon he had bought in an auction house it is a delonghi bean to cup and ha a built in grinder so it is a bean to cup machine it wa effectively a new machine but with one small crack in the water tank which i replaced for gbp20 it is a bit more of a faff than instant or pod coffee but omg the difference really is remarkable i do not think i will ever be a sniffy a james but now i do appreciate that there is more to it than most people realise now i look forward to trying exotic roast and i am enjoying and appreciating coffee more added

hour to open up the lelit grinder and clean the burr to make it ok to sell it should not be that hard to clean something which requires regular maintenance the breville ha very easy access to burr

rancilio silvia i had one of those for year before i upgraded to what i have now which is a wega mininova the main reason i ditched the rancilio is becuase i wanted dual boiler and a hot water outlet plumbed through a water filtration softening unit not long after i actually purchased the wega rancilio released the silvia pro which come with all of those thing i am just not sure if it is a plumbed unit though i am sure it ha the option though i had my original silvia retro fitted to run a a plumbed unit all that being said the rancilio silvia is an absolutely fantastic unit and it make such good coffee if you were just making coffee for one or two people it is more than adequate incidentally the grinder i purchased with the silvia wa also made by rancilio the rancilio rocky non doser version and is still the grinder i use today i could not recommend that grinder more highly anyway back to the video i suppose finger crossed for the silvia edit it wa cool to see the silvia do so

thanks for your video super informative a i have been learning espresso making at home i have discovered that i am overly sensitive to caffene and am wondering if decaf espresso is a topic you would consider a a topic you would explore i am perhaps such a neophyte to miss that decaf espresso is anathema i feel like i have been having some success with the swiss water decaf bean', 'i could not agree more the dedica ha instruction for lowering and rising the temperature in the instructive it also suggests warming up your cup by running hot water on it from the basket which is obviously to also heat up the basket thus aiding with the extraction process speaking of which i actually think that the plastic piece on the basket is key to prevent hot water and hot espresso from touching cold metal since the plastic actually insulates it i feel like when you dismantle the basket and take out the plastic piece then it will lower your espresso temperature playing with the temp setting and also with the grind with different coffee blend ha made my experience with the dedica quite enjoyable for over two year already my rule of thumb is using the low temp setting for dark roast medium for both dark and medium roast and high temp for either lighter roast or for certain more dense and or more acidic coffee another great thing about the dedica is that you can instantly stop the flow by pushing the button again if you push the button and leave it pressed the flow will continue until you release and the machine will remember that setting i e very basic but you can program it', 'i would give it to the bambino i have gone from moka pot stove top steamer la pavoni europicola stove top steamer rancillio silvia sage bambino plus sage barista express i would give it to the bambino the silvia requires too much faff with temperature surfing the steaming power is good but you have to purge load or water and wait like 1min for it to reach steam pressure and you have to make sure you start steaming before the thermostat click off otherwise the steaming run out before it click back in the tank is annoying to remove the brew temp is not very stable it doe not auto switch off i have left it on all day so many time and eventually killed the boiler a the cut off switch failed the bambino is just great it turn on really fast the steam is pretty much instant and powerful the brew temp is stable the steam wand auto purge which is just great for this reason i am keeping this over the barista express it tell you when to clean it it ha a water level low cut off sensor which prevents you from trying to pull a shot on an empty tank sage really have thought about nearly everything with this machine the main issue are the small drip tray lack of weight so you have to hold it down when putting in the portafilter lack of seal sound damper on water tank lid and drip tray so it make an annoying rattling sound and a poor connection from the solenoid valve to the drip tray so water always splash underneath the tray i have had far more consistent result with the bambino from day 1 than i ever got with the silvia after owning it for a few year maybe in theory the silvia could give better result with a fancy pant vst basket but otherwise it really annoying to use because of all the other problem and i am pretty sure not having consistent temperature negates the benefit of a vst basket and the smaller 54mm portafilter are also le prone to channelling so are more forgiving i really do not want to be temperature surfing at 7am in the morning it is bad enough dialing in the grinder at that time silvia wa great a few year back when finding a home espresso machine with good steam power wa difficult and easier than a stove top steamer but sage ha really pushed the technology forward with the thermojet system and the silvia is feeling dated considering you can pick up 2nd hand bambino on ebay for gbp170 it really is the best machine under gbp500', 'anyone know of any tip to keep the open water reservoir on gaggia classic from getting scummy and it hose from getting slimy love the machine but i wish the water situation wa a bit cleaner', 'owner of the rancilio silvia here modded with the mecoffee pid temperature and pressure controllability it is super easy definitely recommend this shot are way better a water temperature is more constant now you can also set a shot timer and do not have to manually stop the extraction you definitely want a good basket and ideally get a bottomless portafilter all in all for a household and geeky home barista this machine is maybe the best to have from a price tag perspective can not get close to a commercial setup cheaper than this', 'great review there is always one thing i find stupid about home coffee machine they can only make a few coffee and in europe they have to turn themselves off when idle in a short time frame to save power yet they all have cup warmer on top that can not get a cup warm because they hardly get warm and definitely not warm enough in the given time frame plus it easier to just warm a cup with hot water', 'i own both the rancilio silvia and the gaggia classic pro the silvia is a tank our un modified version ha been working for almost 15 year without a single problem it is quite sensitive to temperature meaning your shot can be ruined if you do not pull them the second the boiler get up to proper temperature when light turn off but if you are careful and turn off the pump a soon a the light turn on again we get great extraction the gaggia just arrived and i have been frustrated with the low clearance under the portafilter none of my regular sized mug will fit and you can only pull a shot for 5 6 second before the light turn off telling you that the temp ha dropped but a video i saw solved that problem if you click the steam button and leave on for 19 20 second before you pull the shot you get hot water during the entire extraction and the shot are pretty stellar we do not use either machine for steaming milk so i can not comment on that', 'i have the gaggia classic pro and overall i am pleased with it i agree that the steam power is a little weak but it work id be interested in a mod video on this machine to adjust brew pressure and a pid controller for temperature there are some 3d printable file floating around on thingiverse for the gaggia i printed a shallow drip tray to allow for more cup clearance at the sacrifice of capacity', 'delonghi ha water heat setting you can change it', 'i have used two different gaggia classic only one of them mine and they are the only machine of the few i have used on which the portafilter holder broke they lack what a knifemaker would call a full tang and the handle on both eventually broke where the plastic handle meet the metal basket holder i devised a way to repair the handle that wa utterly bombproof you could probably beat someone to death with it without damaging it i also often found myself running out of steam on the gaggia classic especially if making two latte or cappuccino i replaced my gaggia when after thirteen year it needed another rebuild and the cost of the required part exceeded the cost of a new machine currently i am using a silvia 3 and while it work well it ha it shortcoming including a you note it awkward water tank i have often wished there were a simple way to replace the needle type steam valve with a ball valve i am not a fan of needle valve for this kind of application i would much prefer a positive short throw lever to the usual game of winding winding winding on a wobbling plastic knob', 'interesting that the delonghi you have wa so different from mine i just recently purchased mine is stainless steel which compared to others i have used give it a slight increase in weight which allows me to remove the portafilter one handed provided the bottom is griping the benchtop properly also the removable drip tray ha a nice i assume stainless steel cover underneath so that mug and larger cup do not just sit in the plastic bottom which is a nice feature to be included just found it interesting that there were some difference that may or may not have caused a different opinion of it edit by the way after just an hour or so about going through the setting setting the water temp etc i think the difference between the stock shot i wa pulling and what i am able to pull now especially considering the change in coffee i have used is night and day', 'love the video i got my keurig and found a 16oz insulated coffee mug to perfectly match it capacity guess the nice dollar13 99 coffee mug will also be a nice match with the coffee maker in the video', 'love the video i got my keurig and found a 16oz insulated coffee mug to perfectly match it capacity guess the nice dollar13 99 coffee mug will also be a nice match with the coffee maker in the video', 'great video got ta mention that it sound like you are talking with your head in a fish tank a bit distorted', 'another great video i have the older gaggia baby class which i think is no longer made b c the cheap paint job keep peeling which is a great machine would you consider doing a video on modding the gaggia rancilio i temp surf by pulling out about 6 sec of water until the ready light go off then wait until it go on again then press the steam button for 5 sec to get a little more heat and then immediately pull the shot for consistent temp what would you do to mod it and how much would that improve the shot', 'i stopped drinking greek coffee because i mostly find it sour with adstringent taste like when you take acetylsalicylic acid i wa wondering whether you could explain the wonder of making greek coffee ground coffee steeped in boiling water and not filtered', 'i have a dedica and for the price i do not think there anything better i replaced the wand with the rancilio wand replaced the basket with the non pressurized basket and cut off the bottom of the porta so there is no weird hole in the bottom also there are 3 water temperature setting on the dedica not sure if james know that or not a that is one of his complaint', 'maybe it is covered in the modification you described but my biggest gripe with the rancilio is the time between pulling the espresso shot to then having to engage the boiler for the steam wand not only that you then need to wait an eternity for it to cool to pour another shot i learned a trick to using the hot water pourer to quickly bring the temperature down but it is just a frustrating thing to do if you want to make a few drink otherwise i have really liked the machine even with the stock basket so now i will be looking into mod and new basket based on what you have described', 'i have had the lelit pl41tem with pid for a couple of year and love it i would not want a little float on the drip tray to tell me when it is full that would introduce extra complexity and be difficult to keep clean it is quite easy to just peek in there and see if it is full yes i do occasionally have a small overflow from being too lazy to empty the tray but it is super easy to clean up the drip tray is pretty large also comfortably hold 32 oz so you do not have to empty it that often also i happen to like the water tank i find it very convenient to lift in and out and take over to the sink to refill i do not see how any other method would be any easier if you want a machine with a pid the lelit anna is your only choice unless you want to spend a lot more money rancilio ha finally come out with a pid silvia but it is dollar1100', 'in my country for 829 gbp cca you can buy super modded rancilio silvia e which is two temp sensor one in brew head one in boiler it ha two user profile can regulate pump power preinfusion ha lcd which display clock time of extraction can wake up in certain time or go to sleep also ha pressure gauge and water sensor for low water in reservoir and little led light when you can not see your coffee well yet d bit expensive but also keep warranty and no need to mess with modding also noticed that company which sell them sell ascaso dream which i never saw before look very interesting and review wouldnt be bad i guess promising piece imho at least spec wise', 'i own a miss sivlia for about 6 7 year now i love it and the portafilter just feel and fit great i have the same complaint about the water tank though when pouring in from a bucket beaker i have to be super careful not to hit the opening on the side where the tube come out or i would flood the inside of the machine in term of temperature i have exactly the opposite experience it is usually a bit too cold and i have to temperature surf to get on it hot side for pulling shot milk steaming is just fantastic the power is enormous even for larger pot i would really like to see a milk steaming episode from you james i have been watching your channel for a while now and really learned a lot thanks for that and keep up the great work', 'lelit anna with the pid controller pl41tem owner checking in love this little machine it ha it quirk and limitation but to be good to go out of the box for under gbp500 and no need for mod wa hard to beat i have had a ptfe hose or two a gasket seal and the shower screen to replace over the year very easy to work on this machine too most of the replacement were due to my own neglect or making horrible beginner mistake with it having had too many wouldisposable consumer grade espresso machine breakdown and end up in landfill site being able to repair this machine is my favorite feature pro tip for filling the water tank get a nice polished or chromed steel funnel to be a fancy man with everything matching have not lifted my tank out for anything other than

to live on the edge', 'great video james a always can you please elaborate a little more on this issue of too much pressure too high brew temp on this sort of machine i use an hx machine from sab which is not exactly in the price range you are talking about but i think i experience the same problem despite using vst basket good water weighing shot paying attention to distribution etc it is extremely hard to get lighter roast shine a good a they do at my local specialty coffee shop with real pro machine dark and medium roast are fine will it help if i set the pressure to 8 instead of 9 bar', 'he did not but other youtube video have suggested the water temp is a bit low apparently the pid is set at 200f 93c which can be a bit low for lighter roast james doe explain the link between water temp and roast in another video about brew temperature', 'i own the breville bambino plus for a little over a year and have had to replace the portofilter my pet peeve the pressurized filter basket get stuck to the group head often breville recommends removing the group head and cleaning the rubber gasket often like after every 15 shot that mean unplugging removing the water tank turning the machine upside down and removing the group head assembly with a screw driver and pulling the rubber gasket out with a butter knife that is bloody ridiculous wonder what vst basket he used james throw a dog a bone', 'thank you for your video i recently purchased the rancillio silvia i looked very closely at the lelit gaggia and silvia i have been using my silvia since may and i have to say there wa a huge learning curve i had never made espresso before so i had a lot to learn i taught myself by reading and watching video i agree about the temp and steam power i have learned to just purge a little of that steamy water before i place the portafilter overall i am very happy with my purchase and feel it allows me to continue to grow a a hobbyist i learned that rancillio just came out with the pro it is a dual boiler with pid all good thing but the price point is more than double i think i will just stick with my original silvia thanks again for your great video', 'kerem a you probably understand i am no expert and not really qualified to give any meaningful advice if you still want my input i can think out loud first i would figure out how many customer and how much coffee you have potential to sell in peak hour from that you need to determine what your ambition are is it good enough to serve some hot brown drink or do you want to be a high end shop will you serve coffee to take away or only seated customer i imagine coffee to go customer are more in a hurry delay may not be acceptable will you offer both single and double shot coffee in that case you may want to look at a dual brew head machine what if the machine break down can you afford to stop serving while getting the machine fixed maybe you need a professional service agreement that guarantee next day repair do you have time to refill the water tank and empty the spill tray or do you need a plumbed in machine my gaggia kept giving me problem several time a valve wa blocked with some coffe ground the water flow almost stopped and the coffee tasted crap got bored of disassembling the machine to clean out the valve i now use a prosumer machine bezzera unica pid it is a single boiler dual use machine like the one tested here perfect for me who only drink espresso le than ideal for milk based drink if i wa a milk drinker i probably would have bought a heat exchanger hx machine it can deliver coffee and steam without the wait but is le temperature stable and may need purging to get correct brew temperature for home use that is fine if the coffee taste bad you can always make a new cup for a professional service that could ruin reputation example rocket appartamento a dual boiler is more expensive but ha separate system for coffee and steam and with a pid digital temperature controller you can be reasonably sure the temperature will be correct example izzo myway alex duetto and rancilio silvia pro edit this is the brand new big brother of the silvia tested in this video there are a ton of macines to choose from in this price range most if not all are good but have different strength and weakness hope someone with more relevant experience can give you some sound advice good luck english is not my first language but i hope this wa understandable greeting from norway', 'i just bought the delonghi and i do not know if you saw but you can program on it water temperature and liquid quantity considering you changed the cup you should have changed the water setting onal delongi take in 7g and you put 18 allsoo there is programing for water hardness no idea what it doe but soft normal and hard', 'i am using a silvia together with a mazzer mini electronic great combination temperature surfing is something that you start doing naturally in my routine i fill the cup with water from the portafilter before grinding it warms the portafilter and the cup after grinding the machine seems to be at the right temperature for my taste these thing end up adding to the pleasure of using it', 'had a silvia for 4 year and used nearly every day incredible machine but did add a pid to control temp and load of other factor with phone via bluetooth i get used to knowing when i need to fill up tank and use a plastic beaker to catch water so drip tray not really used a a bit of a faff to empty it great review james you are spot on', 'delonghi dedica 685 i bought about 4 month ago i got used to the industrial steam pipe so strange but u can make it happen just it feel like balancing on a rope the portafilter is a bad joke but u can modify it the temperature can be adjusted low mid and high my water is very hard so i have added the softener filter i had to descale it twice so far sometimes if i go too fine or i press the coffee powder too much the ulka pump get stuck it becomes very low on noise and it stop creating pressure especially since i did not change the high pressure inlet in the portafilter yet if the pump get stuck i have to pull 2 double espresso shot without the portafilter on so only water come out from the machine then i can use it again a new it is an ok machine i like the coffee with plenty milk so i do not feel too much if the coffee would be too bitter or something for me it is good enough and relatively easy to use i use it with a graef coffee grinder 800 at around 20 grind size', 'ive got a 2019 gaggia classic pro and it only got the one water tube not two anyone know why this is', 'very nice round up and a good and fair comparison i have had the lelit for about 4 year now it is my first espresso machine and i have enjoyed using it thanks to your video i have definitely stepped up my game over the last year or so and i can make pretty good espresso with it but i also recognize it is flaw i also do not like the water tank and drip tray and i find the non standard size of the portafilter to be slightly frustrating a it is harder to find accessory for it but all in all i think it is a good value for money and a nice machine to start learning how to make proper espresso', 'the bambino here in new zealand is breville rather than sage and only come with the dual wall pressurised basket unless you want to buy pre ground coffee you should 100percent get standard basket here you can buy them directly from breville for approx dollar12 other than the machine being so light and moving around when locking in the portafilter i have loved using it it wa my first espresso machine so i have learned a lot with it but once i ha the standard basket decent bean and got the hang of dialling my shot i wa very impressed with the coffee i could get from it a james said it wa a good machine to learn manual steaming on but the automatic steaming also make it easy enough for visitor to use my young niece love making their own hot chocolate like the one at the cafe another bonus is how quickly it is ready to go literally second and thr water is up to temp unfortunately my bambino died a couple of month ago after having it for le than 1 year due to a disagreement between the service agent and the ship from where i bought it basically over 6 week since it went to them for repair and it had not been touched i got a full refund they had none in stock to replace it and doe not look like they are getting more in any time a their system said the line is finished i have found a couple of chain store still selling them online but they also no longer have them in store i am currently torn whether to get another one or go for something like the sylvia but that is twice the price of the bambino here dollar1300 to dollar1500 v dollar580 to dollar750 respectively which put the breville the infuser in between them in price but closer to the bambino however it look like you then lose the automatic milk frothing while keeping the pre infusion with the infuser but the le then great look or build quality that you get with thre sylvia', 'i might be a little biased because i am a lelit 41lem owner also i can not speak for the others but i have something to add there is important info missing from this comparison like machine internals i know lelit is boiler is brass 250ml gaggia is aluminum 100ml huge plus for lelit do not know others lelit ha a pid version in the gbp400 range 41tem the version 41em in this comparison is the most cheap in anna line tem and lem have nicer button and i think a better steam wand tem ha pid lem ha the water plastic tray hidden there is ims and ascaso basket for lelit 57mm most people say ascaso is the better i have only ims anyway lelit is pretty good value i paid gbp282 two year ago for 41lem with some discount black friday local coffee comunity', 'i do not like any of them i like the manual flair a the quality of everything i use is excellent and being manual one ha the ability to learn and be in control at a very high degree along with my manual kinu m47 grinder i also have quality and control i use a porcelain container to heat the water which is another quality material expensive machine with shortcoming are of no interest to me', 'enjoyed that i have the rancillo silva myself and when i got it at first i ruined more coffee than i thought possible there is a bit of a learning curve with it and figuring out it is foible i wa coming from a cheap delonghi and with that i used to steam my milk then pull my espresso but when i did that with the silva the espresso wa burnt most of the time being a single boiler it get very hot on the steam setting and take a while to cool back down so i had to reverse the process pull a shot then switch to steam it also took a long time to dial in the grind size it wa far more unforgiving than the delonghi too fine and it squeeze out undrinkable tar and too coarse and you get watery blegh but not i have all those thing figured out i am getting very good tasty and consistent shot and smooth and velvet milk in my flat white the steam wand is definitely the star of the show it froth milk so much better than any other consumer level machine i have ever used and for that it wa worth the time spent getting used to it', 'had a dedica it ha 3 water temp i found you had to go to the hottest setting the medium default temp is too cool also the best steaming is by removing the panarello wand and using the rubber inner single hole tube hold it on with a plastic tie wrap or it will blow off in your milk you can play with the timing of the steam switch but i got pretty good milk texture that way in fact this wa how i learned to steam milk the panarello wa not useful when i had this model i did not have a great hand grinder and i would easily choke the machine which created quite a mess i ended up having to remove a screw to take off the screen and clean the coffee grind i cursed this unit and only kept it about 3 month before upgrading today a pid should not be an expensive addition option although the silvia pro with pid is dollar2200 here in canada much too expensive', 'my only experience ha been with the rancilio i think temp have been my issue a well i noticed you want to be sure to give it the right time in between shot while also being sure to dispel some water before pulling since it may have too hot of water at the beginning i also had some weird experience where one minute the grind wa dialed in and the next the water would flow so fast that it wa almost a if there wa no coffee in the basket i attribute this to experimenting with the machine a while and not owning it for a long duration of time really i just mooched off my uncle when he got it hehe i actually enjoy using my flair pro more but the coffee from the rancilio wa super good', 'the gaggia and sylvia are absolute tank and can last indefinitely if serviced and treated well if you are going for budget i recommend buying used so that you can use the extra money on a good grinder', '1 for happy sage bambino owner for future buyer there are often offering them discounted for 300 i bought mine for that euro and the value for money is quite amazing it doe produce reliably good espresso in the morning medium roast lover here and my girlfriend love the auto milk frothing while i can practice my skill manually it just feel like they really tried to make a non frustrating experience for people who want to have a good coffee but with extra feature for u who like to play around a bit for me it is definitely the best bang for the buck especially if you get it for 300 it is compact fit my scale even with alarge cup heat up incredibly quickly and just doe the job made me enjoy the first coffee in the morning a lot more p agree with the negative drip tray a bit too small steam wand can make a little mess cause of that too little heft would be nice too also the water filter feature is nice but since they have changed it they are sage exclusive type with no unbranded alternative and pretty pricy', 'this price range is so frustrating and you have nailed exactly why a i expected i wa all set to get the gaggia which is about 300 pound here in au but would have had to void the warranty to get 9 bar and could not fit a latte glass under the gh with scale silvia is over 500 here usually and it drip tray tank are annoying i am someone who really like to know water level for the reason you identify hard to believe that is not a priority for rancilio user oh and no pid on either make for a lot of guesswork until you are veeeery familiar with the machine lelit anna with optional pid wa front runner for a while but again tank and tray did not do it ot for me if it is in a corner with steam knob facing out you can not see the water level bambino result quite good but feel overly light probably could have lived with this compromise but the dual boiler is now available here for around the 400 pound mark and it really feel worth the extra 58mm portafilter pid for grouphead boiler steam boiler mean very predictable result just need to have more bench counter space tl dr recommend bdb if you can get it in this price range would have been tough to survive this melbourne lockdown without it', 'great revieuw i use the same silvia for a year now and once you know the habit of the machine it easy to use when steaming milk you often will get a tsunami and milk will go everywhere just firstly pop the thing on and let the lil amount of high pres water out

sort and make of the coffee you are using to test this device and grinding level and water quality would be nice to know aswell', 'hey thought on the new silvia pro w factory installed pid i own a silvia w an aftermarket pid by seattle coffee gear and am very happy with all but the tank and drip tray of this machine and it feel like it will last forver', 'i own the bambino plus and i am surprised you did not get the whole set of basket for the portafilter mine came with the whole double and single one a part of the package 2 off also mine is the metal chrome one not the black plastic and it certainly doe not look cheap yes it doe lack a bit of mass but the portafilte feel really solid one thing that is massively better than all the other you demoed is that the bambino come with a built in water filter fitted in the tank and that you can take the tank off sideways if it is under a kitchen cabinet i will not go about the fact it also ha a pid and various bit because i am actually not completely lost in expresso making at this point but to me given the size of the package and the feature it get from it i find it really good in a really small footprint i do feel i can get into getting more anal about the whole process with this machine before i feel i am outgrowing it', 'i have the bambino and i am super happy with it though the point about sour shot is a fair one i have gotten some mindbendingly good coffee out of it but those are rare most of the time it make a perfectly serviceable espresso most of the time i am making espresso tonic and americanos and the milk steaming really is that impressive for such a small machine that is the thing i feel like did not get touched on here is just how teensy the bambino is it is so small for apartment small kitchen type it really is a godsend i would not have space for the gaggia or the rancilio anywhere in my apartment but the bambino fit beautifully onto my bar with space left over for a mat tamper and knock box that is a huge huge upside being only a little bigger than that barely even a real espresso machine little delonghi but still capable of making really good coffee and the water tank is easy to maneuver in and out of the little spot it is nestled into bottom line is i happily use the bambino every day frequently more than once and often pulling multiple shot in a row to make bigger latte or coffee for myself and my girlfriend and it is a pleasure to use doe it make perfect espresso every time no but i am no barista anyway it make perfectly good espresso unless i botch the bed prep it fit in my apartment like a glove i drew my first latte art with the milk that came from it and the button really are very satisfying i am very happy with it', 'mervtones i am still struggling to pull good shot they are too acidic but i am just drinking espresso or long black no milk drink i have tried lot of different type of coffee from light to dark roast i am wondering if it is because the water doe not get hot enough to extract the coffee properly what kind of dose do you use and what is your extraction time', 'i had a rancilio silvia for many year until it sadly died during lockdown which wa 100percent my fault and yes i had to temperature surf it also simple enough once you used it a few time never bothered with getting a pid i found it to be a good reliable easy machine to use and made great espresso and awesome cappuccino i have been waiting for the silia pro but after seeing it is price i would rather buy another silvia with a pid or have one fitted i found the silvia to be one of the better machine i have owned my biggest gripe i have with it wa filling it with water found it awkward and cumbersome and sometimes a little messy to do other than that wa quite fond of it but having a look around for other option', 'bought my rancilio silvia in 2005 a a 1st proper esspresso machine indending to move on to something better when it expired these thing will not die however so

home what we do for love they make a great shot that i enjoy every morning i have very hard water and even though i filter i get scaling issue more often than i wish i had i am currently thinking about upgrading my grinder to a smaller and more efficient model but i am happy with the silvia maybe i could tinker and make it better maybe another machine would take up le space on my counter top

medium or high i am unclear on what temperature those actually map to you can set how hard the water you are using is shot length single or double can also be modified simply by holding down the button you also get a little warning light when the machine need a de scaling the wand is not great but a little angling doe help improve the froth that being said others have pointed out the ziptie mod a well a the option to install a silvia wand though that is more involved pressurised basket are not the best by any mean have not tried the mod james suggests but others have outright sawn off

a refurbished unit for gbp90 so well worth the price', 'i have had a dedica since 2014 got it a a present and back then it wa around gbp150 i do not like waste so i have been saying i will upgrade

like 500 to 600 shot a year so at a machine cost of gbp25 a year and it done over 3000 shot i am blown away with the value i have added obviously the better unpressurised basket a water filter in the tank delonghi do one that fit and fitted a rancillio steam wand for better texture easy mod in your review your absolutely spot on with all of it misgiving i tend to have medium roast and it absolutely fine not amazing but adequate give it a light roast and it just say no i also tend to have a flat white out of it and not really neat espresso so it work perfectly to need and importantly

option and wa one of the main selling point for me i have no problem steaming milk the most irritating thing about it is the leaky steam wand which drip water after a few month of use evidently this is a common problem there is a mod out there to fix it but it involves removing the steam valve and permanently removing a protective collar so it can be disassembled and cleaned without the protective collar you could scald yourself because there is nothing preventing you from overturning the steam control and having the core of the valve followed by steam come out in your hand this

maintain 9 bar of pressure consistently and led to many very frustrating brew the silvia is a tinkerer is dream built like a tank like you said i do not mind temperature surfing or the fact that it is a single boiler after a while flushing surfing becomes part of your routine in the same way that pre heating the portafilter doe one last thing is that sage product at least in australia a breville very often go on sale accordingly the bambino plus is placed at a very similar price point to that of the delonghi in australia check ozbargin for deal it often go for dollar350 aud 196 gbp at that price point it is significan notly cheaper than the silvia or gaggia and for someone who similar to me want to investigate if they want to adopt a pet called an espresso machine it is a strong recommendation however for someone who know espresso know what is involved in making it at home i would steer clear away from the bambino plus if possible while it can make decent espresso it can not really make great espresso and you will waste of much coffee trying to get to great espresso that it will not be worth it not a joy to use and not worth the hassle', 'he is spot on my rancilio is built like an army tank i bought it 7 year ago refurbished from whole latte love with a new rocky grinder both have worked like a charm nothing ha broken all still plodding along just fine for my

blown away why lelit wa the only one with stock basket with vst it would be second choice after rancilio would not it but it could not why you have not mentioned anything about boiler in these machine and temperature stability during extraction is it because gaggia with it tiny aluminium boiler will be kicked off easily in comparison with lelit what this plasticky delonghi is doing nearby silvia is it taken because otherwise gaggia should take the last place especially if delonghi would be replaced with sth from ascaso water tank in lelit is not handy but tank in gaggia is really easy to take

sure your water is at room temp in the water bin at the back of the machine if it is cold water the brew temp will be too cold and you will get sour espresso use filtered scale free water to reduce

learning curve the flair is going to last you a lifetime flair ha highest potential out of these three for espresso but far more inconvenient the lack of temperature regulation on the dedica and the

but more in the dark side since the temp is no so high to use light to medium roast however i am using a hack to increase temp a follows push the steam bottom wait to be ready to steam then turn off the machine and turn on run the preinfusion cycle without the portafilter and stop the cycle when finish the preinfusion then insert the portafilter and do the espresso extraction a normal i do not have a fast response termometer but it seems the water temp is higher that way judging by the espresso flavor i get', 'hi tom i am increasing the temp stability a follows remove the spring from the

put the basket in the portafilter and wait 15 20 sec to warm the basket and finally do a normal extraction i do not have a termometer probe a you have but the coffee is now better the idea of removing the spring is to insert without effort the basket avoiding to generate crack in the puck', 'tom is coffee corner the basket is in contact with the portafilter and the coffee with the basket so a soon

it becomes consistent', 'i personalised the amount of water for a double shot i press the 2 cup button i recommend you to stop the shot in order to get the amount of coffee you like according the coffee ratio you want for example if you like 1 2 ratio you start with 14g of coffee and you stop the shot at around 28g of coffee do not let the machine till the end a it may be too long that is probably why your coffee is sour', 'very pleasing video to watch i like the aesthetic a lot for your coffee setup i would hightly highly recommend some modification 1 get an unpressurized basket or

work but you will be very limited 3 weight after grinding unless you get a single dose grinder you lost 2 6g this way the kg521 ha a lot of dead space 4 you want to have a ratio around 1 1 5 1 2 5 of dose to espresso in the cup e g 14g should give you 28g coffee and when timing i would aim for a little slower because of the pre infusion time of the ec695 5 before making the first coffee always do an empty run without the portafilter installed of water into you cup the temperature of the water after turning on the machine will otherwise be too inconsistent and it also help with cleaning the machine and the water pre heat your cup 6 optional if you want to make any milk based drink you should replace the panarello wand an intermediate solution is to just take the panarello off and lock

double shot for 23 gram on 2oz of water 1 x a single shot at say 10grams on 2oz of water for a total of 33grams in 4oz of espresso so same thing in the end of course with the dinamica you can also do

quite intensive use so it wa time for u to upgrade to a super auto most of the time we are americano drinker and the dinamica doe that easily and the hot water coming coming off the paranello is super hot which wa not the case with our old machine so we usually boiled water separately in a kettle no need for the kettle anymore no more messing with the grinder tapping cleaning up the counter top etc it is our first super auto and being used to do everything manually every morning this push button machine amazes me the dinamica is based on the ecam line which is supposed to have a better and more reliable boiler than the previous esam series we occasionally go for decaf especially for late night dinner with guest and since our old machine wa ese pod compatible we found using ese pod for an occasional decaf wa very practical the dinamica can not use pod but can use pre ground so we just open up a ese pod and drop it in very convenient a it is already pre measured for a single shot which is what the dinamica requires we tried the long drip style coffee but did not think much of it tasted bitter to u the americano wa much better for u may be with a different grind or bean one would have to experiment so far we are very pleased this machine ha everything we were looking for', 'yes the hot water coming off the steam wand is quite hot this is a great machine for americanos the regular coffee mode try to mimic drip coffee but so far we did not like it that much tasted bitter could be the grind or bean i do not know it is just over 5 oz not a very large cup we prefer making americanos with double shot in a cup then add water from the steam wand and it is a hot a if coming from a kettle the machine heat up very fast almost no wait', 'doe the double just double the volume of water or doe it grind more coffee too', 'the couple ounce of water that flush out at the beginning from what i have heard is a small cleaning cycle and it is just cleaning off some leftover coffee

before using the machine it say lesser amount of coffee button the one you referred a a single shot refers to espresso whereas more amount of coffee button referred a a double shot in the video refers to a lungo when i google the difference between a lungo and double shot espresso most post suggest that the lungo us much more water and for a longer time therefore not exactly same a a double shot espresso the manual also explaines regular espresso make about 40 ml of shot and lungo make about 120ml which is 3 time more not double so i have been just using 2x button to make 2 of the single shot

to you if you are used to the double shot that most coffee shop make or maybe you yourself have been previous to getting the eletta upping the coffee taste to extra strong will definitely give you a bolder taste i found that this machine start to make optimal shot after about a week to 10 day of daily use i have about 4 6 shot worth of espresso in various drink daily i found all the coffee it make are near perfect in taste except the flat white which i found a bit weak a it us a single shot i make flat white a a double ristretto and adding milk from the middle setting on the frother manually that make a solid flat white the grinder ha 13 setting in total look for the numberless notch between the number you can dial it in to each notch a needed i also found the espresso wa initially extracting in about 10 second and wa definitely a bit watery after playing around with the grinder setting and running through 15 20 test shot i got it to extracting in about 16 18 second and with much better crema and amber colored flow any longer and the shot were definitely over extracted and too bitter sixteen to 18 second seems to be the sweet spot also have you tested your local water and set the machine to the correct hardness level and are you using filtered water i found a huge difference in taste between unfiltered and filtered water with my local water supply', 'hallo everytime i make coffie with this machine somewhere in the back leak water any idea why', 'hi i have just purchased this machine and over a 2 week period i have had to descale it twice i am on tank

stuart that doe not sound right is the machine telling you to descale only thing i can think of is for some reason the machine doe not think you descaled or completed the descaling cycle the first

automatic i even watched your video on getting hotter drink if i put boiling water in the ceramic mug and let it sit for 2 minute and do a rinse of the machine and a clean of the carafe to run hot water through the spout prior to making the drink the final coffee drink is indeed hotter i can get the temperature just up to 140 degree but that doe take some of the automatic out of our process of course we can use the wand and get the milk hotter but again that make it le automatic with our old manual machine we never heated the milk above 150 degree would love to hear your thought on this are

their machine to help answer the question her reply wa that it go from the water tank plastic and through a plastic tube all plastic are bpa free into an aluminum heating element where water would first get hot once the water is heated there it then will quickly pas through a small grey plastic part a it get released dripped into the coffee cup so the only time that hot liquid come into contact with any form of plastic is this small piece of grey plastic based on this do you happen to sell any model where the heated liquid only pass through metal component piping', 'hi bp i reached out to

boil the water 15 minute before cooling and filtering just wanted to know if i would be forced to buy the filter every so often to make the machine work', 'i eva this machine can be used without a water filter but it is not advised the filter do 2 thing first they contain carbon to remove chlorine that help improve flavor and also prevents the formation of hydrochloric acid heating water containing chlorine creates the acid which in turn can cause corrosion of internal component not a big deal if it happens once in awhile but use without a filter for long duration and this could cause a problem second filter soften the water reduce the mineral level to prevent scale buildup when water is heated if mineral are above a certain level scale will form these machine use thermoblock boiler with narrow passage in which water is heated scale build up in those passage will eventually effect machine performance and if allowed to build up over long period premature machine failure all

is a side by side spec comparison of those machine some thought on them the breville us a smaller pf at 54mm while the classic ha commercial standard heavyweight 58mm with the classic you will of course want a grinder a well interestingly we like the breville smart grinder pro a an economical companion to the classic you will probably be able to pull better shot with a separate grinder the 16 grind setting on the baristas built in grinder can be limiting like other breville product the sgp is considered by some a more of an appliance a opposed to a machine but should be fine for le demanding home use the classic is machine grade v the b barista appliance the classic is user serviceable if you are so inclined we generally do not recommend breville owner go inside the case another big difference is steaming it is autofrothing on the classic and commercial style manual on the breville it is tough to get a latte art capable microfoam with an autofrothing wand but the breville is not exactly a steaming powerhouse when compared to prosumer level hx and db machine both machine are single boiler sbdu so there is waiting for steam with both and manual cooling down required on the classic after steaming but we prefer the classic is boiler which contains a volume of water over the breville is thermocoil which is an on demand system with some practice and proper use the classic probably ha better temperature stability in the end the classic should produce better espresso when paired with a good grinder and user skill the breville doe okay but trade off some potential quality for ease of use hope that help let u know if you have any more question', 'to quickly answer your question yes you will just need to brew a standard espresso shot and add hot water from the spout that being said the hot water spout is not located under the brewing spout and so you will need to shift the glass there is not a pre programmed americano function unfortunately liam', 'ah good question both of these model are extremely similar and each have their own advantage so it will depend on your personal preference reason to buy the dinamica lattecrema ecam35075si ice coffee function more

the top till the water stop coming out', 'i like almost everything about this brewer my previous one wa a keurig 2 0 mybest kitchen and had a lot of issue this one is more basic but all the important feature are there if i had to name something i found a a negative it would be the size of the water tank i wa used to a larger one and have to fill this one daily a we drink 4 large cup every morning but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of thing', 'maybe i am stupid but still do not understand once green button stoped after when light again instead drop coffe drop more water is it normal',

really tamp it down hard so the water is more difficult to pas through also you can try grinding the bean even finer a this slows the infusion and give a stronger coffee failing that use the double

the crema is usually a similar level i do not feel that it is very clear in the video a the cup is really too big and the coffee get sloshed about a lot i did not realise until this video became so popular how important crema wa i have since invested in some espresso cup and photographed the crema here 0 doe the heater element on top of the machine work or effective i do not usually use the warming plate on top a i keep the milk jug up there i gave it a try today the cup are not very warm after sitting on it for 10 minute the base of the cup is 26c after 30 minute it is 29c i used the milk thermometer to measure that a it is the only thermometer that i had to hand so it may not be the most accurate reading how many cup can you sit on top of it doe not look like many at all 6 espresso cup will fit on top how long doe it take to convert to frothing 40 second you said how long the frothing take how much milk wa that for i did not measure it in the video but have gone back and measured the volume of each latte cup which 260ml so it would estimate it wa around 360ml of milk that i steamed in the video is the frother any good compared to others that you may have used i have not used any others i do really like this one but you are not the only one to mention the bubble how easy is it to clean the frothing wand i feel a though that did not a very good job at all the milk should look smooth and not bubbly it is easy to clean both the removable part are plastic and twist off easily i always clean them straight away by rinsing them in hot water soapy i feel that even if the milk dried you could leave them to soak before cleaning them can it do hot water if so how long doe it take to give you a cup is it hot enough yes you can do just hot water although it doe not come out very fast it take 1 minute to fill up a 275 ml cup and it is 71c i hope this help i will try and add more of these detail to the video next time i am reviewing have a good day', 'foodie

until the tamping lever is returned to it horizontal position personally i prefer to use a leveller redistributer after which you may not even need to tamp if you have enough dose the bean in the hopper thing is a bit annoying but then when i used to use breville grinder removing the hopper wa a pita to put back on anyway for home use i see no advantage to having a lot of bean in the hopper in the first place with the delonghi you can have just a few bean in the hopper and it will warn you if it think there are not enough bean to deliver a full dose there is a huge benefit to consistent dosing i had ton of setting on my breville grinder but the setting had a lot of slop and tended to drift so did not help much i hated the slow breville steamer because it introduced too much water

touch and pulled a couple lukewarm shot i am scratching my head and thinking wtf have i done the prestigio is most certainly 100percent higher quality and i bought the upgraded version of the pro he

drip tray is by far a huge step up on the de longhi and the tamping system once you have it geez i do not know if i can be without it now it is so fast and clean and the smart grinding on the de longhi never overdoses even if you adjust the grind it is magic i feel completely duped by online review like this that put the breville on fake platform above all the others the people that buy a home espresso machine like this want something that is good value for the money reliable simple to use and effective we do not want a damn cafe lab in our kitchen with endless tweaking of this and that the de longhi prestigio did all that with flying color i am upset do not be misled by online review fml', 'yup the drip tray on my breville is used to drive me nut with their messy cleanup

it back they told me at delonghi if it could not be repaired they would send me a refurbished one i told them if they sent me a refurbished one i would take them to court i purchased a new one and i expect a new one if they can not fix it i will never purchase another delonghi product again just because of their warranty and customer service i should have purchased another breville barista i

optimum level while pulling shot but still make a good coffee the spent puck are solid and consistent and dry not watery but overall it a good clean self contained machine and make good coffee at the

waste so much coffee to test each new coffee bag you buy and set the machine with proper grind etc and then the next day you are gon na get a completely different coffee and have to reset the grinder and waste more coffee bean you will never be able to extract real espresso which is creamy hot thick and taste good with breville it is always bitter or sour or watery and missing crema or whatnot you are gon na end up wasting your time for hour and wasting a lot of expensive coffe to never find the right extraction and end up using the double walled filter basket to at least have a decent coffee

not know the difference between an italian espresso and a starbucks espresso', 'jkb i picked up the la specialista prestigio newer model single wall basket loving it so far the tamping station is awesome once you get everything dialed in it a wonderful experience you turn on the machine insert the portafilter to get your grind going then tamp it in with the self tamp by the time you tamp the machine is heated and ready to brew build quality is awesome too not sure about the previous model but on the prestigio everything is solid just go to any store that sell both and you will see id

adding water separately like an americano so this machine is definitely an awesome one for u highly recommend it best of luck with your purchase', 'i had two barista machine and both were working for

huge fan of sage appliance and have lot but after my barista failed for the 3rd time i moved to delonghi and it is much easier to get a decent cup especially for an amateur worth every penny', 'you

comment from a true coffee connoisseur one that ha mastered the way of the espresso the way he yield his tool is impressive the way he push down on a lever that tamp coffee down for that non existent

is 30 ml 200 ml also the milk froth can depend on the kind of milk used temperature and even the position of the nozzle refrigerated skimmed or semi skimmed milk is recommended in user guide all in

heated cup and at time put the coffee inside the microwave for 20 second i like hot coffee', 'i discovered a neat trick some people prefer to heat up their cup especially for small one like a

to clean and if you put the used capsule out in the litter downstairs the machine stop dripping everything on this machine is great you can easy clean the milk reservoir also put it in the fridge you can instal your size of cup differently so these are no criterion you can choose for so many different tast of coffee so what you want bitter or sweet i think it is terrible most people put so much water with coffee this look and tasted like brown tea to me and ha nothing to do with coffee my only critical point is that for a real cappuccino you need first to put a ristretto and after you put than some foam on the top normally with a spoon so the milk doe not mix with the coffee but this machine doe first the milk than the coffee wel most people will not mind but this is not an cappuccino it doe tast anyhow very nice and also go with illy segrafredo and lavazza capsule which to me are the best coffeebrands in the world', 'thank you i wa actually looking for a good machine and for me one of the important thing in the coffee and i think it is for everybody is the taste but then the tastecoffee decrease the flavor due to an incremental of water coming in the milk that would be not good for me', 'it is a tough one due to the price difference you could probably survive with the touch but you will have to fill the milk and water up more regularly and also empty the used capsule holder more often my gut say gran lattissima but it is close because of the cost', 'yeah sadly it still dripped after releasing the pod a little more watery with no pod but still not great with this colour of machine', 'just to let you know i bought the machine yesterday mine doe not splatter milk and look messy like that furthermore i prefer the lattissima because it is an all in one machine and cleaning is not a big fuzz you can pour some hot water into a jug and disassemble the milk frother and rinse it like that usually take me 30 second my milk frother is outlet pipe is also positioned on the corner the presentation is so nice with the cup of coffee that i feel sad to stir it everytime so i guess the 2022 model is a much better range', 'coffee run out far too slowly and no it is not scaled up we have soft water infuriating it take so long the coffee is instantly drinkable when the cup ha finally filled up i think i have had relationship which were shorter', 'cleaning the frother unit doe not mean you have to take apart all the part of the rapid cappuccino system and wash them after each usage it mean you have to turn the milk froth regulator knob to the clean position so that the rinsing process start and hot water combined with steam flow and purge the nozzle there are quite a few video in youtube which explains this process', 'but if your reviewing a product do make sure to use a proper cup not a water glass', 'if anyone ha it and doe not know how to descale this machine behind the water tank is the descaling nozzle which plug into the milk frother hose when you remove it very easy but it doe take a while to descale maybe it is how many coffee we throw into this machine daily but actually in the middle of a descale and it is taken over 30 minute already probably my fault actually but you can see the difference when your getting close to time of descaling needed', 'i recently purchased mine and must say i am very happy enjoying amazing coffee i use chilled milk so it doe not splutter out of the frother i find the frother super easy to clean i do that 1x daily take le than 1min under running water my friend who have the aeroccino say they have to clean it frequently a well my only niggle is that my latt glass almost fill over because of the froth', 'thanks for the review we too went from the citiz machine to these a while ago now and have had none of those issue the steam from the milk frothed is to be expected a it is steamed milk easy to rinse all of the part and all the milk frothed part go in the dishwasher which i love yes the water tank is smaller but i am not drinking that much coffee in 1 day for it to be an issue so i recommend it', 'had exactly the same issue i could not believe what a cheap afterthought the cup stand drip tray is i think the cleaning light mean the milk container just need flushing with water rather than a full disassemble clean this is done by pressing a button on ours we had the same previous machine and wish we would kept it', 'i just bought this and i hate it the coffee is watery', 'i do not think you are suppose to get the aeroccino wet all that water on the bottom might cause some issue', 'i suffered every second you were showing the cleaning process so much water wa wasted', 'doge di amalfi l do realise that italian coffee and machine are the best in the world gaggia and lavazza mmmm come to mind but gaggia are very pricey and to get a flavour of that experience abroad in italy at home in the uk the best way possible and most pleasurable surely is maximum enjoyment l am not sure if l mentioned before but respect given to the whole experience make it more pleasurable the same tea blend served in a china cup always seems to taste nicer somehow than when served in a mug do you agree now it been proved by a japanese guy that if you behave nicely to water the actual crystal when frozen are a more perfect shape than ice crystal made from water that is treated badly so maybe there is something in it please see masaru motu on wikipedia for more information if you are interested so there may be something in it who know l think it different if you want a beverage quickly or you are relaxing and unwinding with a friend where you may want something a little more special please also consider that the coffee experience is relatively new to the uk which wa always seen a an american drink or an exotic continental drink in the uk we have moved a long long way from maxwell house coffee granule you must admit also l have no wish to offend anyone it is all personal taste and what may be seen normal in italy is luxury in the uk where a cup of coffee from starbux served in a paper cup is gbp3 4 in italy l have been to venice and bari a cup of italian coffee is about euros2

did not work for her despite the semi automatic bambino wa very easy to use i thought that is why i bought the almost fully automatic magnifica s it went well for her i became curious about how well you could set the right coffee grinding and amount of water so i used a whole afternoon to regulate the mill amount of water and the slider for intensity i think it regulates the amount that may need to be adjusted depending on the type of coffee you use and how coarse or fine the grinding is to improve the coffee and wa quite surprised at how much better it could be today i also use the machine

up and just manually stop brewing at around 2oz the best way to get a dial in on a super automatic is to just use time and volume since you can not really weigh anything so shoot for 2oz out in about 20 to 27 second at first drip honestly it is hard to over extract in this machine generally speaking since it us a pressurized filter basket generally my grind size is at 2 or 3', 'i press the descale light all ok turn the knob then nothing happens i have turned the machine off and on several time but the descale programme will not start when the machine go off and then on steam doe come out with a little water a usual it is just the descale process will not work any idea please', 'i would just start it all over again hold down the rinse button the one that wa flashing before until it is a solid red this time just use normal water no descaler and turn the steam dial all the way and let it do it is thing if for any reason that doe not work if the steam nozzle will not pull water through etc then i would take all the bean out and have the machine make a bunch of long coffee until you have emptied the water container your goal is to just make sure there is no descaler chemical left in the process of making a normal cup so that should do the trick good luck', 'i accidentally did a short press and triggered the normal rinsing cycle with the descale in the water tank is that going to cause an issue', 'thanks for a good video but i have a question should we emptying the tank of coffee before we starting that', 'for those that wonder why it suddenly stop do not do anything yet give it some time and it will continue it is letting the descaling fluid clean the internals before flushing it out wait until the watertank is empty and the light are flashing you can use the flushed out water in your hot kettle so it descales a well tip i got from some comment in here thought i would summarize', 'this machine is a pain it always asking me to descale it i live in a soft water area and have only ever descaled my kettle and iron once in a year this thing is asking me to descale it every month on top of that be aware this only descales the steamer not the working for the actual coffee do not expect your coffee to taste any better afterwards', 'change the water hardness setting', 'alicia yes finally i find the way to just rince the machine with frah water and i have done 2 3 full tnaks with water and now i am enjoying again a freshly brew coffee in the morning thnank for you help', 'stefan kostadinov hmmm you could always do one bad coffee then the next one will be fine or try and descale it again but with just water', 'stefan kostadinov you know what i have learnt since this comment i do not even descale my machine anymore and it ha not broken and it is been about a year i do not use the milk froth i also live in a hard water area i think descaling is a waste of money', 'there is a setting to tell the machine how hard your water is', 'why doe not the water go through the coffee nozzle and only through the steam nozzle it seems like descaling should happen through the coffee nozzle since i rarely use the steam function', 'i wa told that if i buy bottled water i would not need to descale six month later i find myself having to descale i am guessing it is because when i clean the infuser i soak it in tap water', 'demineralized water will create le scale tap water is full of mineral that cause scale not bottled water it is the same a tap', 'stupid video the water stop on only 10 second and the red lamp is lightning', 'no do not use tap water', 'everything else is straight forward except the video failed to mention once machine stop running with red light on stead and do not do anything and let it run through till the tank is empty i thought it wa non stop till tank is empty not sure if anything went wrong so i started the machine again of course the descale solution went through coffee output now i am worried', 'one thing that is missing ist to turn the mashine on before putting in the water because if not it will pump the acid through the usual coffe output i do not know if thats a problem but it might be', 'yes run load of water through it on the pu side least the coffe output is then clean', 'interestingly neither the manual nor the video show how much water to add to the 100ml of descaler fluid the manual make no reference at all to it and the video suggests you fill it somewhere towards the maximum mark but not actually up to the maximum mark it would be nice to have something a little more precise', 'you can see the water in the see throw tank hello open your eye', 'the video say to fill the tank after putting the descaler in', 'you fill the water tank to the top a it will need most of that to wash through the machine', 'just wait it will pause for a few minute rinse some more and repeat until tank empty do not wait once the water ha run out or you will need to start all over again a it auto power off', 'my machine leak a lot of water during descaling i think only during descaling not while using the machine what can i do', 'i did not have the top light flash but the red descaling did stop flashing so i began the descaling process by adding the chemical sold cheaper at bed bath and beyond and fresh cold water to tank it take 15 minute and it will go through a few cycle a if it is in a soak so be patient and let it do it thing walk away after tank empty repeat', 'i also had this problem thought the machine had gone wrong although it worked ok the descaling light wa on i did another descale with the manual in front of me and you must do exactly a it say daniel is correct it is all to do with the steam knob also this video doe not mention washing tank before filling to flush fail to do this and your coffee will not taste good', 'when you made a coffee you said it had three choice from small to medium and large cup all brewed with same amount of coffee bean but different liquid amount so when we do a large cup do we get an americano since it pours extra water and espresso when we do small cup size im i getting right', 'kind of and americano would be a standard shot with hot water added this is pushing more water through the espresso a longer pull possibly over extracting sorry this is a year late the end result would end up being similar but different', 'great video bought this machine yesterday and wa waiting forever to make coffee after steaming milk wa wondering why now youve confirmed that the temperature needed to be cooler seems like i wa waiting for this to happen will use the water function to bring temp down after steaming thank you', 'i received mine yesterday but it show no water light did you have any problem setting it up i can not find any way to contact the company put water into tank made sure it wa inserted properly but it still show red light', 'filtered water delonghi webpage say to avoid demineralized water reverse osmosis the more i read about my delonghi the more i see to use tap water', 'well it is not a lot of water need to be bigger', 'everything i hoped it would be i love the simplicity of this keurig mybest kitchen i have had the old school original keurig for forever i decided to upgrade to button lol same great quality without having to measure your water this keurig doe all the thinking for you i also love not having to put water into the machine every time i want to use it simple and perfect', 'i bought a easm4200 due to review like this on youtube my 4200 take 14 minute to make cappuccino apparently according to delonghi this is right now the thing with this is after you have frothed the milk with the steam wand it take 8 minute to heat water to make the coffee itself by which time the frothy milk isnt really frothy so you end up with a flat white but a little thicker if you wish to make 4 coffee one of which requires frothed milk you can say good bye to 20 min also do not use delonghis online web form for support after waiting a fortnight i phoned and initially after waiting 3 min they picked the phone up them promptly put it down when i phoned again after waiting for nearly a long they said do not use the form email u 4 week now and they answered saying it take this amount of time to make a frothy cappuccino really 14 minute for an angry flat white im an honest opinion do not buy this unit if you want a cappuccino for expressos and longs it work anything else do not', 'no way i will select a cup of coffee with so much water', 'half of that cup is water i do believe is more suitable for an espresso small cup', 'the turning knob at the front are the left for how much water ie half cup etc and the right is for strengh you got it the other way round but all said and done a smashing machine', 'why it always say insert water spout while i put it in already', 'hey guy my machine keep telling me to fill tank but which one the tank', 'house sitting with this machine and i did all you said except for descale and the frother is still spitting out milk not frothing descale light is not on but i would descale just to try that however what is the solution you mentioned i have a 30 year old krups machine that i rinse through with some white vinegar and water every once in awhile unless i can get this baby to froth all the bell and whistle are worthless my 30 year old krups espresso maker is super simple to use i have to add the water each time and put the ground espresso into the holder myself but it is simple and work great any other tip for cleaning that frother by the way your direction are really nice and straight forward thank you', 'doe this machine have any plastic part through which hot water would pas', 'hi richard there are plastic part which water come in contact with', 'my machine stopped pulling water from the tank this happened over the course of 2 day i replaced the water pump the flowmeter o ring diffuser cleaned internally and lubricated everything could it be the in line filter just after the water tank i am soaking the tube in hot water with a little clr today but they do not appear clogged what else could it be when i watch it with the side off water is not pulling through the tube also the machine now make a higher pitched noise when trying to run coffee is being ground and pressed it appears to be just a water issue no leak idea', 'i only use filtered water so it is not a descaling issue everything is smooth a silk however i found that when i replaced the flow meter it did not want to kick in i had to bypass the filter and pull out the flow meter to allow the tube to straighten out i also unplugged the circuit and plugged them back in a couple time i soaked all the tubing i also removed the top which may have freed up a kink somewhere eventually it started working i do not know exactly what the solution wa but apparently enough part and messing with the tubing worked', 'hi nikki sorry for the delayed response just back from visiting manufacturer in italy one common cause is scale formation in the boiler i can not be certain that is the problem in your case but it is a possibility especially if you have hard water and did not treat filter the water to remove excess mineral or neglected to descale the machine a recommended by delonghi', 'hi guy i wa wondering is there a way to regulate the water temperature for the espresso brew', 'hi i purchased this machine recently and really love it is there a way to add a water filter to this i do not think the water tank is designed for one but how about if it just floated in the tank', 'hi guy i do not have one in front of me to check if it can accept a typical plug in tank filter a quick check of the machine manual make no mention of a water filter in that case a free floating filter is a good option here is a free floating pad filter we recommend', 'thanks for the helpful video did you guy ever come across the issue of not being able to create steam my steamer never switch from spouting hot water to the dual thermal steam hoping it is not broken a it is brand new', 'i just got it off amazon a xmas gift that i hope to have all set up and working by then did not expect to have to trouble shoot this much i have tried what you suggested with no luck the machine sound labored but measured and only drip of water come out hot water feature is fine just no steam when expected', 'hi sue you are welcome so your machine continuously pump water when you turn the steam on be sure you have not pressed the hot water button before turning the steam dial the light above the hot water button should not be illuminated when you want to steam milk also turn the steam dial and purge the wand of water then turn the dial back to off then back on to start steaming if the hot water light is off and the machine never produce steam then there may be an issue where did you purchase the machine', 'thank you very much i could not figure out how to open the water reservoir i thought you open it like a door', 'thanks for your helpful comment it seems like the machine go through a lot of cleaning cycle which can be good but is it annoying it doe seem like a ton of water a mikearman mentioned thought', 'the machine will run through a cleaning cycle at start up and shutdown or when it go into sleep mode some machine allow for you to adjust the length of time before it go into a sleep mode which will decrease the amount of water used a for how often the drip tray need to be emptied that is totally up to how often the machine enters in and out of these mode and size of the drip tray', 'this thing look like it us a ton of water to clean itself how frequent are these cycle and how often do you have to empty the drip tray', 'hi gail great wouldown to earth review a usual on the breville are there any plastic part inside the machine that get in contact with hot water or coffee i heard there is a plastic under the filter on the actual portafilter can you confirm thanks', 'i had a breville for 11 year always great coffee after it started leaking 11 year of use just think about the quality of the machine i went to a delonghi magnifica s mainly due to people coming in to the house and not knowing how to use the breville all i can say is the delonghi is a nice machine keep bench clean but disappointed in the coffee it make it weak and doe not have the nice full bodied flavor the breville is produce im sure it a combination of the amount and quality of grind preinfusion method water temp portafilter and the micro froth that make the big difference over the delonghi you can definitely tell when pour the milk much much darker on the breville and if go more boutique bean you can taste the difference not so much with the delonghi where most bean taste the same but quality bean do make a difference with strength and extraction on the delonghi so i guess if love the flavor of coffee and like the manual process go the breville if want a clean work area and want coffee more for the hit then go the delonghi in a perfect world and will prob happen is would have both i have tried coffee on extremely expensive automatic machine and the result is about the same a a delonghi i have made better coffee on the breville than what i have had from many many coffee shop', 'so there still is not a single fully automatic espresso machine that would make a decent espresso shot not trying to compare it to something much more expensive but seems like even a dollar100 semi automatic espresso machine pull out a better shot than a dollar1000 fully automatic one right the main complains about the fully automatic one no matter if they are dollar300 or dollar1500 is poor control over the shot usually more watery than it should be even when you choose the strongest possible setting in regard to coffee strength poor temperature often not a hot a it should be more time for warming up more water consumption overall not a big deal but no a nice feature either quite poor steam wand and therefore milk foam etc i would like a fully automatic one but not at the cost of a watery and warm cup of espresso i have little control over', 'i have one of the older delonghi machine the magnifica x and i am able to remove just the shiny metal sleeve on the steam wand just like you did in the video and i steam with it off in doing so i am able to have better control over the amount of air i put into the milk just like a normal steam wand have you tried steaming without the metal sleeve if not can you give it a go and let u know what you think also instead of brewing a double shot in the magnifica i dialed in the perfect grind dose and water amount for a single shot and would then pull a single shot twice i end up with a pretty flavorful latte if you have the chance can you try dialing in and pulling a single shot twice and let u know how it go for you love your video and hello from a fellow seattlian', 'agreed she seems somewhat biased i have a 10 yr old esam 3200 and can attest to it amazing track record capacity to make pretty darn good shot with decent crema and bang for buck value', 'interesting and relevant comparison but having recently purchased the 220v version of the delonghi esam 4200s which seems to only differ on minor cosmetic point i think you are selling the full auto a bit short it ha 13 grind setting numbered 1 to 7 with intermediate position click the bean hopper is smaller than stated it is around 1 2 lb 200g per the operating manual the panarello can be removed a shown for cleaning in which case one can get much better foam with experience and skill a is the case with any machine assuming the dial setting on the display model and mine are comparable i would expect a watery coffee with too little coffee for the amount of water setting the water dial to 9 00 and the coffee dial to 3 00 would give much better result slightly over 1oz in the cup with around 9g of dried coffee ground for best result i would recommend purging the steam wand and then inserting it into the milk container push the steam button and wait for the light before purging after steaming milk and turning off the steam button i suggest purging the steam wand for a few second until water come out of it the machine is then ready for coffee in second it is not a perfect machine it is a bit plasticky compared to the gaggia titanium it replaced at home the water tank is small the steam wand only swivel and it requires some tuning to give good result the range of the coffee and especially water amount is excessively large but with some tlc it make pretty good coffee and work well the startup time is fairly short probably because plastic ha little thermal inertia cleaning is very simple it lack some comfort feature compared to other full automatic presets autostart informative lcd display etc but it provides fine control which some of the fancier machine lack i understand that it is pretty reliable hopefully it will beat the 14 year i got from the gaggia and that the internals are identical to the fancier delonghi model which make me feel smug i am silent on the 4 setting temperature control a temperature seems to vary quite a bit from pour to pour unfortunately hot water is delivered on the steam wand at a consistent 90c 195f but brewed coffee in cup vary from 58 135f to 65 150f depending on setting and shot overall not much to complain for the price', 'thanks for such an informative comment my workplace ha an old delonghi caffe venezia esam 2200 i believe and to my eye it is largely the same machine the brew unit the grind setting the overall functionality everyone in the office just make watery americanos with it without knowing it full potential', 'hi milen thanks for your great video my friend i have two delonghi machine is and one of them i use a spare part only now my main machine esam 3500 n doe not brew coffee normally it only drip one drip at a time i have timed the brew and it completes the brewing in 1 56 second one minute and fifty four second you know that is very long i have also replaced the water pump transmission

hard water recently we use that egg shaped krups coffee maker for capsule and we do not use any water filter so i do not know how about this one and how about decalcification how often and with which substance i have heard these official product are expensive i have found some recommendation in discussion to not use citric acid because it is agressive is it but lactic acid in 40percent solution with water we use citric acid for our kettle to decalc it no problem but this machine is waay more expensive so i do not want to break it of course d so i am wondering how much there will be additional cost for filter water softener if any etc could you please give u some recommendation of your own experience and sorry for many question here thank you', 'filter not included but you can

it lol when you identify the leak if it at a junction point then most likely it an oring if that the case you will need to pull the metal clip take the oring out you should be able to see the oring

doe not have a soft plastic water tank you would know any brand new decent espresso machine cost a lot because it would include rock solid material and technology of temperature and pressure control espresso drinking is a science and an art espresso coffee is tested first without milk actually it is not tested with milk first but you are just a sale person who display a total lack of knowledge of the espresso industry it take at least more than dollar1 000 to buy a decent machine without rubbery and plasticky material soft plastic and rubber cause cancer this machine in particular smell like rubber and leak rubbery smell all over not only because it interior is made of rubber hose and soft plastic it basket filter is made of rubber but also because it pump produce excessive pressure and heat it water at too high boiling temperature but of course you would not care to even notice that it portafilter and filter are 50percent rubber because you belong to the fast coffee culture who think expresso mean fast boiled latte and cappuccino mean steam wand this machine is for the most ignorant population and it saddens me that delonghi make such dirt i fell in this trap a a prey consumer of this cheap and rubbery machinery until i learned what it take to produce balanced and finely tuned coffee drink if you like your expressos taste like rubbery coffee go ahead and keep

standard brew flow rate for espresso which cause poor extraction acidity and it smell and taste like rubber the aeropress is a machine with huge acceptance and following by coffee expert now aeropress

the moment but still the coffee is not a strong a it would be from a cafe obviously you can get better machine than this one but i still expected nicer coffee', 'there are either 2 problem why this is occurring the grind of the coffee is not fine enough or the machine doe not use enough pressure to expel the coffee i am not sure if you grind your own bean but you have to make sure whether you do it yourself or have a barista do it for you that it is a fine grind it should be like fine sand if it is not fine enough then it will come out watery and sour and also i forgot to mention but another thing could be that the coffee bean you are using are too much of a light roast lighter roast are usually not a strong a darker one and are used for drip coffee or french press so if you are using a lighter roast i would suggest trying a darker one and finally the machine may have a pressure problem because if you notice it drip slower when brewing then the machine probably doe not expel enough pressure to be consistent i would try troubleshooting it from their customer service or maybe get a replacement if your machine is noticeably broken sorry if this is too long i am just a barista bored

inners are subject to same set of issue of calcium build up rubber seal aging etc even with proper maintenance many component do not out last other machine by a meaningful and useful way i think your argument about build quality is mostly centered around the concept of using metal versus plastic in that regard plastic technology improves and you can see breville is good at adapting those new technology to improve durability and touch feel of their product in that regard phillips also do a good job at it are breville perfect is every sense no but they are pretty darn close a you spend more time making coffee and get to know all the little nuance about the process i think you will appreciate breville more most of u have gone through the same process path', 'w that is quite a good

bigger shot the grind affect the quality of the brew if too coarse the water go through quickly and you do not get espresso if too fine the water can not pas through the coffee and you will get a low volume shot if any if you are buying pod a a beginner you are looking for ese pod only and make sure the machine ha an adaptor', '5 00 if he can not say the inexpensive mass produced machine make crappy espresso then it is making good espresso the shot looked fine seems it would only need a proper grind of some good coffee to make a really good espresso bonus with the water dispenser configured a it is you can probably even do pre infusion by twisting that side control a you introduce water into the portafilter', '1 thing i am confused about in your video you never showed where you poured the water into versus the milk do both go into the removable clear plastic container in the machine', 'so if i fill the clear container with max water and fill the handle with espresso fine will the machine automatically only make 1 shot of espresso or i have to eye it up and stop the machine i noticed just now it used all of the water in the container so filled up my entire cup and after my shot is done when i open up the handle the entire thing is still full of fine espresso grind but wet am i supposed to have that in the handle still after i am finished', 'i see so only water

dispensed and some that do not often time it is a personal preference this is delonghi is entry level machine with a great price point if you wanted a machine that will automatically stop they do have that available in the dedica model and some others they are more expensive but also more convenient', 'all of the water from the reservoir will continue to come out you have to pay attention', 'i just

more sanitary 10 ha a slightly large footprint 11 doe not vibrate a much you no longer need to hold the espresso cup in place during extraction all in all the stilosa is better in every way except for

remember the exact size but i think the newer model ha a smaller water tank but yeah honestly they are both pretty similar i feel like there must be some internal change for it to have a totally different name since on the outside it is so similar apart from the wand another thing is if you want to get into modifying or upgrading the machine with different part if you need to replace something or get it serviced the ec155 is definitely the better pick', 'hello vanessa i usually buy bean from my local coffee shop i try to buy the one that have been roasted fairly recently the

basket important if so what psi do you want i have a steamer and it ha a pressure regulator switch in it i can turn the adjustable screw on the top of the switch to set the pressure of steam that come out there is a pipe that go from the tank to a pressure gauge so it not a big deal to add a pressure gauge and a adjustable pressure switch when the pressure i set is reached it shuts off the power to the heater that go around tank i guess when i am controlling the pressure in the tank i am controlling the temp of the water so i guess what i would like to know is what is more important in making good espresso the pressure it coming out or the temp of the water or both what is the magic pressure or temp wanted at 9 03 you said the delonghi doe not have a pressurized portafilter but you did not say what system the delonghu us what should we be looking for do a you have a link to the bare minimum espresso video your were talking about making', 'bruh my old machine wa like a combo of all the

meant by pid controlled well basically the temperature of the water ha a sensor which talk to a computer the way pid control work is if the temperature get too low you need to add more heat to get it back to the right temp and if it get too high you have to remove heat but then you get iunto a back and forth where the temperature is always dipping and rising trying to catch up the way pid work is

everywhere after using it even though the drip tray is not even near full it come with the same plastic spoon tamp thingy and it is pure evil it is way too small and flimsy oh and one more thing those

information on a saeco part and repair site all saeco pressurized portafilters have built in valve for pre infusion delay the operator doe not have to worry much about the fineness of grind or tamping the grind setting should be like the table salt grain no tamping is necessary the valve inside the portafilter prevents flow of water through for 4 to 5 second allowing the extraction pressure to build to the required 9 bar the 4 to 5 second delay allows the coffee ground to be soaked and swell allowing water to dissolve essential aromatic element in the coffee before extraction a the valve open up at 9 bar pressure the coffee extract drip into the cup a a classic shot of espresso if the quantity of extract is limited to 2 oz it will not be bitter or have any burnt taste because the

up on in this video is the steamwand to be honest most of them are just crap the steam is often not consistent and they are a nightmare to use in the first place the standard tip are garbage and all

is perfect and better than anything i tasted before at any coffee shop now i did many thing such a buying proper grinder non pressurized filter proper coffee and the same tamper he us but before doing all of that i learned one technique that you can try right away and it might just work without all other thing i learned that there must be a space between coffee level and the top screen from where water come out i always thought that coffee should touch that screen and loaded the filter a such that wa a big mistake if you think that you may also load too much try loading le and compress harder test your load lock it into position and remove do you see any scratch on the coffee surface are there any coffee grind on the metal screen of the machine if yes then you are loading too much apparently it is important that water fill the empty space called headroom first and then start sipping through compression is very important press hard and make sure it is levelled watch some video how to press properly these two thing headroom and proper compression should make a big difference adding all other thing i mentioned will elevate it to all new level', 'anthony according to the manual you should position an empty container under the cappuccino maker and open the dial for a few second to eliminate any air left in the circuit close the dial again so you should not draw any water just make sure there is no air caught up in the tube this is very different from the instruction for cooling the machine to make coffee again to make coffee again immediately after frothing milk the boiler must first be cooled or the coffee will be burnt proceed a follows place a container under the cappuccino maker open the steam dial to deliver hot water and cool the boiler you only need to draw hot water when you want the temp to go down to coffee making level if you draw water before wanting to use steam you are basically cooling down the machine before you start it make no sense', 'jcosk8 i think he is doing it correctly he first draw it down to release some of the residual water that is how it is explained in the instruction manual a well i understand that if you continue to draw water it will cool down the boiler so that you can make espresso again i think he is right in that it is not the strongest heating element so you have to let it warm up for a few minute i also have my toaster plugged in to the same outlet i do not know if that make a difference', 'do you do it like him if so it is wrong the down position is to draw water and bring the temp down so you can brew coffee after steaming milk if you draw water and bring the heat down then it stop midway in the steaming if you do it correctly it should not stop you will actually have to cool it down to

the normal situation is 25 30 second for 9 bar of pressure however the ec685 give you 15 bar of pressure it is expected that your shot will appear like 15 20 second 2 the normal portafilter ha a 58mm radius with 18 gram of coffee however the ec685 with the bottomless portafilter ha a 51mm radius with 15 16 gram of coffee so your shot will be even faster since the coffee puck will have le resistance 3 i have tried using the finest grind setting and it chocked the ec685 and no coffee came out a a result so if you have a short extraction even with the finest grind setting you have to tamp harder you need about 10kg of force to make the coffee puck harder before putting it into your ec685 here is the technique that i am currently using 10 15 kg tamping 15 0 gram in bottomless

coffee too and i often use it that way if i do not want to bother with making a cappuccino or latte milk steaming and frothing on the other hand ha been super frustrating some of that might be my lack

a little stove and kettle and i have been making instant coffee it is much cheaper but far from ideal is there any way i can get closer to achieving the taste of good coffee myself in my truck without

video i am uncertain whether i should upgrade to these thinking gaggia classic or silvia i currently have a gen 2 francis francis x1 which ha a really good pid temp control measured temp and it is good and in any case adjustable inside on a pot i am really unsure about pressure on this or how to measure it or change it also it is a physically tiny machine with no space between head and tray and will only take 15g of coffee in the portafilter steaming is slow a well mine is also mega rusty so need a refurb but a strip down and re paint would fix that not sure it is worth the effort any opinion on the francis francis x1 v a gaggia classic or silvia think i am talking myself into a new machine', 'i got the lelit victoria which doe have a 58mm portafilter a well pid preinfusion pressure guage and the ability to change brew and steam temperature it cost more of course i do not like it water reservoir although it doe have a low level indicator or the steam knob which i seem to have to rotate a lot to get to full power it feel a bit flimsy compared to my previous faema family which died after 20 year', 'nice review btw you put the drip tray grid the wrong way round on the lelit if you put it the other way it look way better cause there s no gap anymore and also it s not wobbling around etc i ve got the lelit anna but with pid pl41 tem for a while now i can really recommend it and i really think it s especially good for beginner cause you always have some kind of visual feedback and also control in the end it s the same process a with a machine without pid trial and error but it s le of a guessing game cause you can see the temperatur in the kettle and can easily work your way up to a good shot by adjusting the different parameter grind temperatur time etc i got mine new for 390euros i think you get good value for your money also one important thing is the spare part availability it s really easy to get lelit spare part so you could potentially have the machine for a whole life i guess if a part your delonghi is broken well you can throw it away a much a i love it here are some con for those of you that consider buying the lelit like james already mentioned the steam isn t a powerful and also pretty watery but with a small single circle mashine you ll never get that good steam but it seems lile the rancilio doe better here the water tank it ha a strange odor to it after a while and the opening is pretty unhandy do get water in without spilling and also almost impossible to clean properly the new one have a better tank with a big opening i think almost every anna owner changed the tank into a glas vase or another plastic tank i did cut a bigger hole in it you can only see the water level in the tank from one side unhandy if you need to place it next to a wall the portafilter doesn t slide in too well so you got ta hold it while putting it in o think that d different from machine to machine and i guess it s because the tolerance while building aren t that high on this part the first two machine i ordered were scratched really badly in this area the drip tray itself is a bit wobbly cause of the design the drip tray grid doesn t habe enough hole in it too much metal cover if you wan na steam in the drip tray after steaming mill it really make a mess cause of the watery steam hitting the metal grid u get used to it and either steam in a glass or a towl or place it directly above a hole the top part aka cup warmer doesn t really get that hot the tamper it come with is just a cheap plastic thing u can t use the single espresso portafilter don t know the proper name somehow me and a lot of other people can t get good shot with it but that s also a common problem not only with lelit sorry if my grammar etc is wrong i m from germany', 'hi james thanks for the video very informative and proof that facebook and youtube is listening to me a it know i want an espresso machine my current home coffee set up is

ready to buy a really good grinder', 'i have had my rancilio silvia for eight year and it still delivers espresso every day at a reasonable high quality i am partly convinced the reason i have not upgraded my espresso setup yet is because it is the silvia granted a dual boiler would be nice due to the elimination of the waiting time between shot and steaming milk if one is new at espresso brewing and milk based espresso drink i really think the silvia is a good choice it punishes the user for not doing thing properly and it can be a frustrating a motivating for learning the basic my machine wa around gbp400 at purchase 3 999 danish kr', 'i have got a gaggia classic in white i think build in the 90 and a there are some frustrating aspect of it water tank removal could be easier temperature and pressure are sometimes a hit or miss it is also easy to get fixed a the part used are being made for decade and that is both cheaper and more environmently friendly than buying a new machine', 'i have a confession i sneered at mr hoffman after my first exposure to his channel where he reviewed a gbp300 bean to cup machine from aldi around about that time i had moved from instant coffee to a pod machine and wa enjoying the novelty of all the random flavour option that they offered i had the opportunity to upgrade pretty cheaply to an espresso machine when a friend of mine bought one a part of a return pallet deal from amazon he had bought in an auction house it is a delonghi bean to cup and ha a built in grinder so it is a bean to cup machine it wa effectively a new machine but with one small crack in the water tank which i replaced for gbp20 it is a bit more of a faff than instant or pod coffee but omg the difference really is remarkable i do not think i will ever be a sniffy a james but now i do appreciate that there is more to it than most people realise now i look forward to trying exotic roast and i am enjoying and appreciating coffee more added benefit is that i am generating a regular pile of puck to mix into my compost bin to add a little nitrogen unfortunately the only downside is that i love it so much i can now hear my heart beating all day and i am down to around two hour of sleep a night', 'this wa such an interesting video because i have actually owned three of the model you tested i love a good coffee but i do know that it is also a very personal thing my first machine wa the delonghi dedica which i absolutely loved i loved the taste of my coffee wa great and i always felt like i wanted to go home and make one instead of getting one at a cafe i own a hair salon and i bought the rancilio for my business it wa an amazing machine but i agreed with you on every point i will also add that the base of the machine around the drip tray rusted completely rendering the drip tray completely useless a i could not pull it out to empty it my current home machine is the bambino plus and i loved it so much i replaced the rancilio at work with another bambino plus honestly for a very decent home machine i think it is absolutely the best value for money and i love the self detecting milk temperature feature i recommend it to everybody but that is just my opinion thanks for a great video', 'loved reading your thought on the dedica i am a student and made the awful awful awful mistake of trying espresso for the first time on my family is home coffee setup 2 day before moving into my student accommodation the dedica is price is a big draw and if people say they can get good espresso with it then i guess i might a well get one edit i picked up a used dedica for gbp65 a little while ago in perfect working order but with some cosmetic damage the espresso it make is really quite good for the money once you replace the portafilter and basket but if you use espresso ground coffee from union coffee you need to run a very high dose i am running a 20g dose and getting 38g out in 28 which taste pretty good', '1 for

the other machine in the video a it a so much cheaper it needed it own under gbp200 video a most of the machine in the video are double that the machine i chose in the end is the sage bambino plus and so far i am really really happy with it i bought it from a 200 degree coffee shop and they are so helpful when buying with any question and after buying if you have any issue sage themselves are also really helpful through email or phone call if you have any issue 200 degree even offer a free course on how to use it through zoom they always have 10percent off the rrp price in store and are currently giving away a free 1kg bag of bean with the machine if you are confused about the difference between a sage bambino and a breville bambino there is none breville is simply the american name for the sage company just like walker crisp and lay crisp', 'i picked lelit pl81t in this preis category one problem is the lelit pid doe not show the current temperature', 'silvia all the way for me after owning a delonghi and a sage which is more appliance than machine the silvia will be going long after some of the others pack up plus temp surfing with it is easy no pid necessary bring up to temp place a plastic container under the head and draw water through until the heater lamp light again leave until it go out then draw a little of the excess steam and over temp water until the steam hiss disappears this u usually no more than few second insert portafilter and brew your coffee perfect every time with the right grinder i use a mazzer personally', 'just purchased a sage bambino i decided on this machine because of it versatility i spent some time modifying the flow to get the perfect espresso temperature control consistent and excellent and the milk steamer allows me to play with the milk with more than sufficient power or anyone in the house can have excellent result by pushing a button what i would like to improve drip tray too small factory setting for extraction awful but quite easily modified a proper basket included overall an excellent coffee experience easy to use i give it a 8 1 2 out of 10', 'i have been looking for my first coffee machine for month and had my heart set on the dedica then i watched this video and now i am back to the drawing board', 'i had free gift card money and went with the bambino i ditched the portafilter and bought a dollar60 wood handled one with a bottomless 54mm basket on amazon i did not have an espresso grinder with finite adjustment and i bought a eureka mignon silencio i am able to pull shot through a naked portafilter without any channeling on the bambino but that is because i have a dollar500 grinder now i like flat white and the auto milk frothing is good enough for me middle setting on heat lowest on froth you are not going to do any latte art with the milk jug that come with the machine unless drawing antartica is considered art what is frustrating is how sensitive the bambino is to grind size you can see on james is grind chart the bambino is by far the coarsest setting compared to the others anything too fine and it will jam the group head an 8th of a turn on the silencio is the entire grind setting range for the bambino there is practically zero adjustment i am just shy of choking the machine to get a double shot 18 8g in 38g out in 28sec and it still taste thin to me any shot programming change with different bean or blending two bean in varying ratio the grinder is still breaking in and i have found the shot programming to be useless to me so far i am ready to ditch the bambino after 2 month it also demand a cleaning cycle every 50 shot manual state 200 but i have had the blinky light twice in two month clean me or i blink cleaning cycle every time i turn on i am only doing 2 shot a day i could see it having a place in a motor home', 'somehow i came here to check on the de longhi my bf wanted we are tight on money and can not afford to spend too much on coffee but get rid of our current shitty senseo coffee maker i am a bit disappointed to see that the other machine used in comparison are way off the range of the de longhi they are all over 300euros and even close to 500euros when you can find the dedica for le than 200euros i do not think you can really compare and the de longhi doe not seem to belong in this video i guess i would like to see a comparison of coffee maker under 200euros for people like me who want good coffee and can not afford throwing a monthly rent worth money into a coffee machine', 'your review did not highlight the problem with gaggia classic is on off switch i bought a new classic replacing one we have used for over 10 year only to find that the power switch wa faulty in a phone conversation an agent from the distributor said they had on going problem with the classic faulty motherboards my machine ha been returned to be fixed we have not heard anything from the company not even an apology we are hugely disappointed i did watch your

it apparently the current deluxe model have more clearance that the older model i have initially i kept pushing button too by accident when holding it to fit the filter but honestly i got used to that and learned to hold it right i never even think about it anymore otherwise i have no complaint i use it with a dark roast it is been churning out 8 to 10 coffee a day for year between me and my partner and ha been a great performer', 'i need help what do you guy think about the silvia pro double boiler for 1 5k other than that i am currently thinking about a silvia or lelit pl81 or pl91', 'i bought the sage bambino plus from curry in ireland it wa on special for euros219 which is really great value it came with 4 basket for the portafilter single shot pressurised and non pressurised and double shot pressurised and non pressurised we got it for our land rover overland build so the 3 second from switch on heat up time wa also a massive factor we were sent the lume portable grinder by lume while it is nowhere near a bad a the one in your review we want something that is more consistent can you recommend a main powered grinder which is quite compact that would suit our bambino we really can not have a huge grinder because space is very limited in our vehicle', 'dedica is low power than hand with flair', 'i would give it to the bambino i have gone from moka pot stove top steamer la pavoni europicola stove top steamer rancillio silvia sage bambino plus sage barista express i would give it to the bambino the silvia requires too much faff with temperature surfing the steaming power is good but you have to purge load or water and wait like 1min for it to reach steam pressure and you have to make sure you start steaming before the thermostat click off otherwise the steaming run out before it click back in the tank is annoying to remove the brew temp is not very stable it doe not auto switch off i have left it on all day so many time and eventually killed the boiler a the cut off switch failed the bambino is just great it turn on really fast the steam is pretty much instant and powerful the brew temp is stable the steam wand auto purge which is just great for this reason i am keeping this over the barista express it tell you when to clean it it ha a water level low cut off sensor which prevents you from trying to pull a shot on an empty tank sage really have thought about nearly everything with this machine the main issue are the small drip tray lack of weight so you have to hold it down when putting in the portafilter lack of seal sound damper on water tank lid and drip tray so it make an annoying rattling sound and a poor connection from the solenoid valve to the drip tray so water always splash underneath the tray i have had far more consistent result with the bambino from day 1 than i ever got with the silvia after owning it for a few year maybe in theory the silvia could give better result with a fancy pant vst basket but otherwise it really annoying to use because of all the other problem and i am pretty sure not having consistent temperature negates the benefit of a vst basket and the smaller 54mm portafilter are also le prone to channelling so are more forgiving i really do not want to be temperature surfing at 7am in the morning it is bad enough dialing in the grinder at that time silvia wa great a few year back when finding a home espresso machine with good steam power wa difficult and easier than a stove top steamer but sage ha really pushed the technology forward with the thermojet system and the silvia is feeling dated considering you can pick up 2nd hand bambino on ebay for gbp170 it really is the best machine under gbp500', 'i have the delonghi i am new to the espresso making world so i am probably not the best judge but i am happy with it what are the drawback of using the stock portafilter pressurized i have just researched a little and i am even more confused my understanding wa that the pressurized basket is so that you do not have to worry too much about the pressure but in that case would not modifying the portafilter increase risk i do not think the delonghi machine allows for pressure setting mine doe not at least and while you can get a longer extraction by pushing the button longer it would not change the pressure', 'i love my 15 year old gaggia classic which i have running at 9bar but the temperature fluctuation is frustrating and temperature surfing can be a bit hit and miss still a great machine to which i have a deep emotional attachment', 'great review there is always one thing i find stupid about home coffee machine they can only make a few coffee and in europe they have to turn themselves off when idle in a short time frame to save power yet they all have cup warmer on top that can not get a cup warm because they hardly get warm and definitely not warm enough in the given time frame plus it easier to just warm a cup with hot water', 'i actually have both the gaggia and silva i am finding the temperature surfing a key to learning how to pull constant shot it is fairly frustrating to pull an amazing shot and then the next one is confusing i think i will be looking into doing some mod because i like that sort of thing i am also curious about your thought on the next level up on machine rocket expobars is it worth just spending more or modding this level of machine', 'what a great review thanks james i am on my second gaggia classic not the brand new model in fact my current one wa secondhand but i have recently added a pid courtesy of mr shade vst basket bottomless portafilter and adjusted the opv pressure to 9 bar none of it wa that difficult to do i have spent about gbp150 and the machine cost about the same it is made a massive difference and even the steaming is enhanced because the boiler maintains temperature better now i am trying very hard to perfect my espresso technique and using lot of coffee in the process it is a pretty simple machine and if looked after they last year my first one did around 18 year james i would love it if you could do an aeropress video thanks for a great channel', 'i have the gaggia classic pro and overall i am pleased with it i agree that the steam power is a little weak but it work id be interested in a mod video on this machine to adjust brew pressure and a pid controller for temperature there are some 3d printable file floating around on thingiverse for the gaggia i printed a shallow drip tray to allow for more cup clearance at the sacrifice of capacity', 'most serious testing group agree often rating that breville with much more expensive one', 'i have used two different gaggia classic only one of them mine and they are the only machine of the few i have used on which the portafilter holder broke they lack what a knifemaker would call a full tang and the handle on both eventually broke where the plastic handle meet the metal basket holder i devised a way to repair the handle that wa utterly bombproof you could probably beat someone to death with it without damaging it i also often found myself running out of steam on the gaggia classic especially if making two latte or cappuccino i replaced my gaggia when after thirteen year it needed another rebuild and the cost of the required part exceeded the cost of a new machine currently i am using a silvia 3 and while it work well it ha it shortcoming including a you note it awkward water tank i have often wished there were a simple way to replace the needle type steam valve with a ball valve i am not a fan of needle valve for this kind of application i would much prefer a positive short throw lever to the usual game of winding winding winding on a wobbling plastic knob', 'great video james a always just one thing re steam and the classic what i have found with the original classic and i have found the same to be the case with the new pro 2019 is that if you start steaming before the steam ready light come on you have more steam power here', 'sotitofanschop thanks for the input that is really helpful that sound like a much le frustrating experience especially when trying out new thing thanks', 'mason chamberlain the spring is the easiest thing to replace it is really simple not even 5 min there is a few video on it to me it completely changed the machine i had found it very frustrating to use with inconsistent and harsh shot and tough to dial in with a new bag of coffee with the lower pressure the shot started getting a lot more consistent a much more mellow flavor like really really noticeable and better tasting coffee no more harshness or bitterness the spring mod is also very cheap', 'mason chamberlain the 9 psi opv spring is relatively easy to replace just need a screwdriver to take the lid off the machine and a spanner of the right size to undo the bolt that hold the current factory spring in and put in the new spring and retighten bolt it make the machine run a little quieter a the pump is not working so hard and i find the shot come out more evenly and gently taste seems more balanced and consistent on the shot a the shot pull at a slightly lower pressure for slightly longer the pid is a lot more work to mod but i also recommend it to get much better temperature control and stability the other easy mod to consider would be the silicone group head gasket a it make inserting and removing the brew basket smoother and easier over the factory rubber gasket that get harder over time and the stainless steel group head mod note some newer machine already come with the steel group head over the earlier aluminum head that wa stock on the earlier machine the steel head is heavier easier to clean and will maintain better brew head temperature stability too good luck', 'i have owned my silvia v5 for about 3 year now in the beginning it wa a very very frustrating experience if you are someone who strives for a degree of repeatability so you can tinker with brew ratio or recipe temperature surfing is the one constant inconstant that will make your espresso life miserable it is like throwing dart while wearing a blindfold that said i knew if i could get through the learning curve i would have a great machine on my hand that wa capable of making great espresso after about 18 month i felt gained enough experience with the machine that i earned the right to have a pid added to it that wa a game changing moment and ha made the machine way more enjoyable and versatile the pid even help a bit with making the milk steaming a bit faster you also get pre infusion based on the model granted it is about a dollar300 u addition but i do not feel you are going to get a single boiler machine a capable for roughly dollar900 at least not in the u for a moment there i wa considering selling the silvia and pony up for a dual boiler machine with pid but after adding it i realized that is exactly what i needed the machine is well built doe have a deep community of user steam like a beast and if you are pulling straight shot and or interested in 2 back to back milk drink i think you will appreciate this machine hope this is helpful to anyone in the market for one nice work james a usual', 'i own a delongi dedica my first machine of this kind at all i also switched the basket of the machine and additionally i made the portafilter open bottom i had much trouble getting stable result from the machine currently i am using a small basket 9 10g and the high temperature setting with this i think i am able to pull decent shot most of the time with the big basket i often had the extreme of too fast shot or the machine clogging with the puck but that might also be a thing by using a cheap grinder a well problably this ha been said 1000times but i would recommend to at least get either machine or grinder with a good quality even if you are on a budget because if you are new to the art having no experience and flunky equipment will give you plenty of frustration an undrinkable shot at lleast it gave me thanks for your review', 'thanks i have been waiting for you to review the ranchilio silvia so happy you did thank you please before you give the ranchilio silvia away buy and review it with this pid it also work on the gaggia classic so you can even try it on both of them just make sure you

amazing ton of steam power and great espresso shot if you know what you are doing of course', 'maybe it is covered in the modification you described but my biggest gripe with the rancilio is the time between pulling the espresso shot to then having to engage the boiler for the steam wand not only that you then need to wait an eternity for it to cool to pour another shot i learned a trick to using the hot water pourer to quickly bring the temperature down but it is just a frustrating thing to do if you want to make a few drink otherwise i have really liked the machine even with the stock basket so now i will be looking into mod and new basket based on what you have described', 'thanks for the review am currently with the delonghi dedica for the past 5 year and looking to upgrade to probably

interesting and review wouldnt be bad i guess promising piece imho at least spec wise', 'i own a miss sivlia for about 6 7 year now i love it and the portafilter just feel and fit great i have the same complaint about the water tank though when pouring in from a bucket beaker i have to be super careful not to hit the opening on the side where the tube come out or i would flood the inside of the machine in term of temperature i have exactly the opposite experience it is usually a bit too cold and i have to temperature surf to get on it hot side for pulling shot milk steaming is just fantastic the power is enormous even for larger pot i would really like to see a milk steaming episode from you james i have been watching your channel for a while now and really learned a lot thanks for that and keep up the great work', 'i found with my gaggia that i get the best milk when i start frothing before the light come on and i can really draw out the heating setting it give me more power and a faster froth i have a heavily modified old model classic though not the new pro model', 'thanks a lot james i have got a gaggia that i have had for over 15 year good a new i did swap put the old panarello wand for a sylvia one i love it i am also glad that i am a black coffee drinker because the steaming is a bit slow and i remember ftom age ago it would steam three coffee before it needed a rest it currently my faithful workplace workhorse', 'i own the gaggia classic pro i have changed out the portafilter to the bottomless type which i prefer i agree with it wandering temperature and under powered steam wand pressure i can make okay flat white latt drink but i use my breville frothing machine when i want a nice frothy drink', 'thank you for your video i recently purchased the rancillio silvia i looked very closely at the lelit gaggia and silvia i have been using my silvia since may and i have to say there wa a huge learning curve i had never made espresso before so i had a lot to learn i taught myself by reading and watching video i agree about the temp and steam power i have learned to just purge a little of that steamy water before i place the portafilter overall i am very happy with my purchase and feel it allows me to continue to grow a a hobbyist i learned that rancillio just came out with the pro it is a dual boiler with pid all good thing but the price point is more than double i think i will just stick with my original silvia thanks again for your great video', 'it take around 45 second for gaggia to get up to full steam power that is when the steam light turn on if you start steaming at around 40 second the light will not be on and so you get steady steam power', 'bought a delonghi 7 year ago a my first espresso machine did not really know about espresso or coffee in general back then so i just went with the most cost friendly option now while i am learning more about espresso and latte art definately regret the decision back then but also at the same time i am not ready to invest in a new machine so just currently trying to make some modification on the delonghi to make the whole coffee experience a bit more pleasant', 'i removed the air incorporating attachment from the steamer on my delonghi and it went a long way to improving the milk texture that attachment is really frustrating if you want a bit more control over the milk', 'i owned a rancilio silvia for more than 10 year i am very happy with it and learned a lot it is true what james said about the temperature it is also pretty frstrating if you have guest you will have to wait for the temp to down to do the next capccino even if you surf the machine they you would still need to wait for the temp to go up for the milk if i were to buy a new one at this point i would surely go to the next level but there is no money to do that anyway', 'what about the cecotec power espresso 20 barista pro', 'i am a huge fan and by no mean an expert i have an old gaggia and this specific delonghi i have them for 10 year i must say that the delonghi make better coffee for my taste my current bean are hausbrandt qualita rossa so they are exactly what you said would work well with it i maintain them very well the delonghi still make the same coffee it did 10 year ago but the gaggia started to degrade after 7 year i use high end ro filtration system the one that is connected to the delonghi wa replaced 3 year ago to the best one available where i live so it might be all connected just thought i share the delonghi seems to make better chocolate after taste from those bean i also get better extract from equivalent maro is 80 20 i keep recommending people this delonghi or just go higher in the price range for a good machine but where i live it is 10 time the price i am personally just do not see did not feel the reason to spend more on the gaggia having tried them both but i am not talking about this same gaggia a i have an old model', 'very nice round up and a good and fair comparison i have had the lelit for about 4 year now it is my first espresso machine and i have enjoyed using it thanks to your video i have definitely stepped up my game over the last year or so and i can make pretty good espresso with it but i also recognize it is flaw i also do not like the water tank and drip tray and i find the non standard size of the portafilter to be slightly frustrating a it is harder to find accessory for it but all in all i think it is a good value for money and a nice machine to start learning how to make proper espresso', 'owning the silvia you are spot on great for milk and will make great espresso for the effort my gripe is the drawn out cooling flush required after steaming making it very difficult to make back to back milk drink instead of investing in a pid i think i will save up to get a hx to steam and brew at the same time fortunately they hold their value superbly', 'the bambino here in new zealand is breville rather than sage and only come with the dual wall pressurised basket unless you want to buy pre ground coffee you should 100percent get standard basket here you can buy them directly from breville for approx dollar12 other than the machine being so light and moving around when locking in the portafilter i have loved using it it wa my first espresso machine so i have learned a lot with it but once i ha the standard basket decent bean and got the hang of dialling my shot i wa very impressed with the coffee i could get from it a james said it wa a good machine to learn manual steaming on but the automatic steaming also make it easy enough for visitor to use my young niece love making their own hot chocolate like the one at the cafe another bonus is how quickly it is ready to go literally second and thr water is up to temp unfortunately my bambino died a couple of month ago after having it for le than 1 year due to a disagreement between the service agent and the ship from where i bought it basically over 6 week since it went to them for repair and it had not been touched i got a full refund they had none in stock to replace it and doe not look like they are getting more in any time a their system said the line is finished i have found a couple of chain store still selling them online but they also no longer have them in store i am currently torn whether to get another one or go for something like the sylvia but that is twice the price of the bambino here dollar1300 to dollar1500 v dollar580 to dollar750 respectively which put the breville the infuser in between them in price but closer to the bambino however it look like you then lose the automatic milk frothing while keeping the pre infusion with the infuser but the le then great look or build quality that you get with thre sylvia', 'important to note with the silvia is that the unstable boiler temperature also effect the milk steaming in my experience you basically have to start steaming milk immediately after the light switch off to get that powerful steaming however if you wait just a 30 second 1 minute it get considerably weaker and you have to steam for a lot longer', 'a a new rancilio owner hobbyist barista lockdown gt melbourne silvia not going crazy i am grateful for the reassurance that learning to steam milk on the beast is not easy have been terrified of it is steam power though soldiering on with chris baca is voice in my head yelling crank it i my silvia and rok gc grinder so very much i give it a little pat each time i use it it is an enormous source of joy thank you very very much for this video and will isee you at the cupping', 'watched this with interest a it ha the one i own and the one i wa considering upgrading to i purchased a dedica 680 about year ago slightly used for dollar100 this wa an experiment to see if i could save some money because my wife love her vanilla latte with almond milk iced at dollar5 to purchase those she could make a quad shot and be done at a fraction of the cost it work quite well for her she is not a snob just want to push a couple of button and have it happen for her yes it is only a 51mm portafilter which is frustrating the temperature is adjustable i tend to use darker roasted bean i have experimented with the 3 setting and found the one that work for me i have a decent grinder but not sure it would cut it with an unpressurized machine but it is what i have had and it work great for making regular coffee from either my technivorm or breville precision brewer i like taking something that will last me a while at work i do make latte with the dedica but learned early on to take off the panarello wand portion and just use the rubber portion it make it shorter so it is sometimes hard with certain pitcher getting it low enough but i can get decent milk texture from it now creating latte art that is the fault of the artist for dollar100 money well spent a an experiment my worry is that the unit i wa hoping to purchase the gaggia classic pro seemed to have some issue a well i understand modding an inexpensive machine like the dedica but it seems that the piece that you talk about modding not including a pid should be done right the first time at the factory for no increase in cost i do like it that it doe come with a pressurized basket so i have a backup plan if my grinder doe not grind fine enough and can start setting aside some fund to upgrade so even though my unit did not make out great i am still happy with the experiment and do not have that much invested in it so that there is room for modding thanks for the review a always', 'i got the rancilio a few year ago i chose it because it look like it ha not been changed in year which is a good indicator of long term support and longevity in general i just want to say thank you for talking about it is drawback i have noticed some brew do not come out a well and i am definitely going to try the temp purge thing before pulling my shot also now i am thinking about a new basket for it pretty sure 1200 comment in no one is going to be reading this but just in case thanks', 'so i have the de longhi ecp3420 i know about my basket issue and have known for a while i can remove the plastic piece inside my current portafilter but because the basket is 51mm i find it very difficult to find the right basket especially a vst one im probably just going to get a bottomless portafilter anyway but how or where do i find a good basket to fit a 51mm', 'i have had my second hand mid 2000 is classic for a little le than a year now and i love it the mod community is fantastic i have only really done the steam wand and blind opv the steaming power doe vary a bit in my opinion and doe take getting to know the machine a bit if you learn about how long it take to heat up and you can start steaming before the light turn on the heating element stay on and you get quite a bit more power', 'i really enjoyed your review but i wish i could afford gaggia or rancilio they both are seems decent for me living in turkey is like it just let you to watch them not to buy them because of the power of turkish lira it make me so sad just wanted to share my thought', '1 for happy sage bambino owner for future buyer there are often offering them discounted for 300 i bought mine for that euro and the value for money is quite amazing it doe produce reliably good espresso in the morning medium roast lover here and my girlfriend love the auto milk frothing while i can practice my skill manually it just feel like they really tried to make a non frustrating experience for people who want to have a good coffee but with extra feature for u who like to play around a bit for me it is definitely the best bang for the buck especially if you get it for 300 it is compact fit my scale even with alarge cup heat up incredibly quickly and just doe the job made me enjoy the first coffee in the morning a lot more p agree with the negative drip tray a bit too small steam wand can make a little mess cause of that too little heft would be nice too also the water filter feature is nice but since they have changed it they are sage exclusive type with no unbranded alternative and pretty pricy', 'this price range is so frustrating and you have nailed exactly why a i expected i wa all set to get the gaggia which is about 300 pound here in au but would have had to void the warranty to get 9 bar and could not fit a latte glass under the gh with scale silvia is over 500 here usually and it drip tray tank are annoying i am someone who really like to know water level for the reason you identify hard to believe that is not a priority for rancilio user oh and no pid on either make for a lot of guesswork until you are veeeery familiar with the machine lelit anna with optional pid wa front runner for a while but again tank and tray did not do it ot for me if it is in a corner with steam knob facing out you can not see the water level bambino result quite good but feel overly light probably could have lived with this compromise but the dual boiler is now available here for around the 400 pound mark and it really feel worth the extra 58mm portafilter pid for grouphead boiler steam boiler mean very predictable result just need to have more bench counter space tl dr recommend bdb if you can get it in this price range would have been tough to survive this melbourne lockdown without it', 'i recently bought a lelit anna after ton of research so it wa really interesting hearing your opinion on it i got a slightly upgraded model that ha a pid so it is nice to know the exact temperature i almost bought a gaggia classic and strongly considered a rancilio silvia used but what sold me on the anna wa the pid and pressure gauge it is also the nicest looking imo3 i agree that i wish it had more steaming power overall i am really happy with the lelit a someone who is just getting into the world of espresso making', 'i own the new gaggia classic the model in europe is called new gaggia classic and in usa is called gaggi classic pro and the milk steaming tends to be frustrating at time it start with a good spin and then seems like it loos power for steaming and sometimes the milk texture is not a foamy and silky a it should be maybe i need a pid for the machine', 'to get excellent steam power on gaggia classic you just have to practice a little temperature surfing i have the original gaggia classic and this is how you do it start steaming before the boiler reach max pressure before light indicator tell you it ha reached the correct pressure which use to take around 30 second after you press the button so start steaming at around 20 25 second and the machine will build pressure during the whole steaming process it work very well', 'i had some problem with the gaggia is steam power but i have noticed that if you purge the condensation before reaching the full steaming temperature 10 15 after pressing the steam button you get much better pressure to use also yeah that tray is atrocious', 'really liked this one i have the dedica currently and definitely feel the pain point you mentioned in the video hope you will consider reviewing machine under dollar1 000 thanks', 'daniel moriss jeffery no problem happy if my suggestion help even the smallest bit please tell me if i am rambling though i do not want to bore you or come across a a know all grind is very important especially with non pressurised filter basket so if you really want to get better espresso more consistently having your own grinder is important i use a baratza encore with a small mod to enable it to grind fine enough for the unpressurised system electric grinder on the cheaper end of the scale probably will not be suitable for what you need it for and even some of the more expensive are made with a focus on grind consistency for a coarser grind for brewing method such a v60 filter but are not great for espresso it is worth doing some research and reading review if the thought of spending almost the price of the coffee machine again on a grinder put you off i am sure you could get a good manual grinder for le than gbp euro dollar100 it is a delicate balance getting the quantity of coffee fineness of grind and firmness of tamp correct if the coffee is too fine it is very easy to overtamp a bit of adjustment is to be expected when wouldialling in different coffee anyway even a the coffee age it may be necessary to grind a little bit finer to get a better extraction this is a great reason for having your own grinder that and of course the freshness each time you grind if you can persist and iron out some of these issue finding what work best for you i have no doubt the result will be worth it regarding the steam wand yes i feel it is been a worthwhile modification i have found a little technique in getting a nice steady flow of steam from the machine and with the proper frothing technique the milk is just that bit more textured more glossy and in the right hand not mine yet can make great latte art i will say that it wa frustrating at first because it took a while to get used to and the panarello already make decent milk just not quite a good a with the rancilio wand it is a toss up between the effort required and getting that little bit extra out of the machine', 'i have bambino plus you can call it pro since i have single and double unpressurised basket and in this category it is a winner it ha ton of feature a you said even i do not use auto steam milk feature it is still there to be used some day easy to clean tiny place needed to be set pre infusion feature which i use every single time that help to get better espresso especially with difficult bean you might have experienced james you forgot to mention that the machine is ready in 3 second after you press the power button that is a big factor to choose between them anyways there are dual boiler machine hx machine etc i am thinking of upgrading one day just for fun but waiting for a machine will heat up in approximately half an hour for a single shot is a big no for me ridiculous time consuming for a single shot with bambino i just press the power button and viola it is ready to go instantly cheer', '3 month ago james these under gbp100 espresso machine are terrible spend more money current james these under gbp500 espresso machine are not bad but you will want to spend more money and mod them my wallet can not keep up with james advice', 'i have owned a rancilio silvia with pid since march and it is been an absolute pleasure to learn on currently looking forward to getting a vst basket amp bottomless portafilter for it james is absolutely spot on about the build quality and steaming power', 'with the gaggia if you start steaming the milk before the ready light come on i find after about 33 second then the heating element stay on giving you way more steam power heat just a little quirk which is easily solved', 'the robot or flair not neo paired with a bellman bodum for milk texturing will absolutely dominate all of these machine in shot quality at a way lower price it should be seriously considered at this price range much of the leftover budget can be added to the grinder budget to get an even better shot or at getting accessory like knock box good scale pitcher cup these machine are frustrating to use and most people will upgrade from it to something like the pro 300 in the future which also is not worth it imo if you have this setup', 'i have been owning a silvia for the past 4 year and i installed a pid on it classic auber kit 2 year ago to be honest i could not be happier now i really love it and you can really feel these machine are built to last however a i started my espresso and coffee journey with it i can not express how frustrating and unforgiving this machine can be especially for beginner', 'this wa a great rundown i started on the silvia and you are absolutely right the steam power is awesome and somewhat intimidating but really did not take all that long to get the hang of i will also agree about the water tank annoying to fill and too easy to overfill one of these day i need to build a refilling system for it', 'if i wa new to steaming milk i would make a mess a whole bunch of time hey that describes my experience trying to learn to steam milk on a silvia it ha been quite frustrating', 'hello thank you james i wa waiting for this one i own a dedica with rancilio wand and non pressurized basket and lack texturing power indeed both hand necessary for locking in portafilter wa looking to upgrade into something better for steaming and texturing and almost bought a classic now will hold that decision until demoing maybe try the new rancilio silvia pro would love a video comparing steam and texture of breville sage thermojet v rancilio boiler', 'i have a gaggia classic pro and you are spot on one small free trick is to essentially temperature surf the steam power once you get more comfortable with the machine you learn how long it take for the steam light to come on the trick is to start steaming before the light come on this trick will keep the heating element on and act more a a thermoblock you get actually very good steam power this way but it doe take some effort and experience similar to temp surfing brew temp not ideal but not too difficult after a few week with the machine', 'i have been using gaggia classic pro for almost two month now and i spent the first couple week getting to know the machine at factory setting i have to say my experience with the steamer is totally different from yours i thought the steamer wa very powerful and it worked the milk almost too fast for me part of it probably due to the fact that i usually steam only small amount for piccolo and the milk rose to the desired temperature so fast that it wa a bit hard to get proper milk texture at first note that i live in thailand and the model sold here could be a bit different after couple week i installed the opv mod spring to switched to 9 bar and loved it a week later i installed pid controller both mod actually came at the same time but i decided to install one at a time to see how much each of them affect the machine is performance and i got two thing out of it the shot are now very consistent because i now know what temperature i am brewing with and no more surfing the second benefit is that the pid also control steamer temperature so i adjusted it to be a bit le powerful about 140c not sure what is the factory set up wa but it wa higher for sure so i have more time to steam my small portion of milk all thing considered i have to say i am very happy with my gcp and a bit surprised to see it came in last in the steaming race love your review though and i have to say i knew from the get go you would pick gcp and miss silvia lol', 'alyssaschroeder yep that is what i heard from other people too i mean it is not a bad thing i imagine steaming for two normal size latte would be a delight considering how fast and strong the steam wand is but when you only do milk for one piccolo at a time like i do that power is a bit overwhelming', 'i just want to add that yes you might want to mod a rancilio and it might add to the cost but i think this is a massive plus for this machine the ability to grow a you learn and add v waiting much longer and saving more money to buy a more expensive machine with feature you do not understand yet might be even more frustrating it is hard for someone new to understand the impact of a pid in the cup this machine ha room to grow and you can grow with it it is a fantastic starting point', 'great lineup james thank you i have a very old rancilio silvia and a rocky grinder that my brother bought second hand from italy and i brought back over to the uk in my luggage on your least favourite budget airline having the 9kg rocky in my carry on bag raised some eyebrow in security but i wa through with some bruising from backpack strap by the time i got home what we do for love they make a great shot that i enjoy every morning i have very hard water and even though i filter i get scaling issue more often than i wish i had i am currently thinking about upgrading my grinder to a smaller and more efficient model but i am happy with the silvia maybe i could tinker and make it better maybe another machine would take up le space on my counter top but a a daily cup i am very happy after many year of service to me and who know how many year of service in it life before me', 'well i actually have one of these in a way at least so i am able to finally chime in my machine which i purchased earlier this year for eur 519 90 would be the lelit anita or pl042temd to give it it correct designation it is a slight step up from the entry level anna that you tested the most noticable difference of course being the inbuilt grinder more on that later the anita also come with pressure gauge toggle switch a much improved steaming wand and a pid i had to add a bottomless porta filter distribution tool and tamper for the lelit is non standard 57mm design i did look into better basket which are available but have not yet decided to get one your vidoe will probably result in me ordering one okay so the grinder really is not that great not a surprise but certainly frustrating especially when you are just starting to get serious about your espresso in the end i gave in and bought a commandante which doe a much better job at grinding for espresso based drink the lelit grinder still get use for coarser setting like vietnamese phin drip filter coffee or the mokka pot though actually i wa not that interested in having an inbuilt grinder to begin with it is simply the only machine in this price range at least with a steam wand on the left side which did matter to me so doe it make decent espresso absolutely no problem frothing milk either thanks to the better steam wand it is still a single hole design but omni directional and well it just seems to work fine no issue regarding pressure or temperature either the other weak design choice which you pointed out are of course valid but in general it is a very capable little machine for the beginner mistake are repeatable no electronics to hide anything from the user and overall solid build quality it did take me two or three month to finally get to a point where i am happy with what i can do with it and the coffe it produce often far better than what pass a espresso in coffee bar okay i do invest in fresh high quality locally roasted bean too', 'got my new basket on saturday and while this might be a case of confirmation bias my shot seem to taste much better indeed i am currently using a very classic italian blend passalacqua mehari though hard to tell if the same applies to lighter roast but i am pretty impressed for the time being at around eur 12 it is not exactly outrageously expensive to upgrade either', 'dan cosma you can get a ims competition series basket designed to fit 57mm porta filter amazingly they are currently out of stock meaning i probably bought the last one you might be able to find them elsewhere though or wait until they become available again', 'i got the gaggia pro back in march and your analysis match my own experience the brew basket portafilter and grouphead seal definitely needed to be upgraded to make better espresso while i wa thankful for the le vigorous steam wand on the gaggia for learning i do with it had a bit more oomph i am currently looking at mod to squeeze every inch of ability from the gaggia the rancilio look great but with gbp100 for mod on a machine that is gbp100 gbp150 more at the start which is gbp150 i could put towards mod on the gaggia and have an arguably better machine for the same cost', 'recommend a used breville sage duotemp underpowered steam wand not necessarily a bad thing if you are new but a consistent 9 bar and ha a pid great little machine that you can get used for around dollar300', 'i have had my silvia for 12 year while the faff factor is real e g need to learn temperature surfing it doe not take long to get it to acceptably reliable for me the best mod you can make is getting a better grinder i started with the rancilio rocky and i have used a baratza vario and eureka atom both of those were loaner from friend now grinding with a niche zero to eliminate the current level of faff in a new machine requires a pretty massive jump in price happy to be wrong here the quirk of this machine teach you a lot about making espresso and while i certainly get that many people will want to buy their way past most of these thing it is been a great part of my coffee journey', 'thank you for the great video i have dedica japanese version it ha lower powered pump due to voltage issue i have changed the portafilter to an aftermarket bottomless portafilter and it improved the overall experience significan notly not a high pressured a gaggia or silvia but the temperature can be changed to hotter setting did swap out the steaming wand to silvia steam wand which also made the milk frothing experience much much better living in a tiny 20 m 2 apartment in metropolitan tokyo dedica is small footprint make a great choice i have used breville sage barista before but is way too huge for my kitchen overall if one is willing to make few modifying and up their skill it a great choice if i had space then i would go for gaggia though', 'when i wa in the market for a machine around this price a couple of year ago i wa looking at the gaggia classic rancilio sylvia breville sage duo temp pro and the ascaso dream the dream is aesthetic won me over instantly and i liked the feature set the build quality is phenomenal it is super solid the switch are super satisfying to use and i get to look at a beautiful bright orange art deco thing on my counter every morning i did load of research before jumping in but i wa new to the espresso game and dramatically underestimated how badly i would want a 58mm basket the dream is odd 57mm basket proved to be frustratingly restrictive a i started to get a handle on thing i have looked high and low and can not find any other basket option apart from the stock ascaso basket in hindsight that alone might have been enough to push me to the classic or sylvia', 'i had the same problem with my lelit 57mm can be frustrating check out ecafe e they have a section dedicated to 57mm accesories i found a vst filter 12 18gr for 57mm group a well a tamper and levelling tool i live in spain so i do not know what the shipping cost would be to where you live but it is worth checking', 'i have owned a gaggia for 6 month now and i pretty much agree overall i love it but like you said the large drip tray is annoying and playing the temp surfing game to avoid having a steam assisted shot is really annoying a a beginner i actually like the lower power steaming one other bummer is i have noticed is the chrome is starting to flake a bit on my grouphead overall i would give an 8 10 a great first espresso machine', 'thanks for putting this video together james i researched these bad boy for month before purchasing the gaggia classic pro i am using the kinu m47 simplicity a my grinder and it is a really nice pair since may i have been able to pull some beautiful shot although the consistency from the machine is unfortunate having a bottomless portafilter help to create more space for a scale and cup steaming and texturing milk wa frustrating for the longest time but over the past few week i have been getting really nice result for anyone who want amazing value and desire to pursue great coffee i would recommend the gaggia classic pro for sure', 'i own the gaggia classic pre 2015 it is actually heavily modded now pid better steam wand upgrade to shower screen holder shower screen gasket basket and finally the pressure down to 9 bar i do not really do milk drink so lately i have been wondering about the diminishing return between my current setup and a better machine something like the profitec 300 how much of an upgrade in quality would i actually be able to see in the final cup', 'gaggia classic take is spot on opv mod is absolutely necessary in order to get good shot out of this machine and definitely the steam pressure be something to be desired a there is just not enough however i think these machine last forever a long a you take care of them which is great and plus you can pick up one of these used for cheap which would give you the budget to add a pid get a new steam wand to replace the steam one on the older one buy a new basket buy a bottomless portafilter and just improve it and be at a lower price point then the rancilio however if i wa able to get a rancilio at a lower price point say dollar200 i would probably buy and switch over just for the steaming power because i make milk drink all day long', 'i used to have a silvia and it wa frustrating to use until i added a pid to eliminate the need for temperature surfing while the build wa solid it wa unrefined rancilio do not put much effort into making it look and feel slick it is unapologetically industrial and i once cut myself rather badly on a sharp edge on the drip tray grate', 'hey james in regard to steaming milk on the gaggia classic i suffer from the same issue a very underpowered steaming pressure and my heat indicator light turn off midway through the steaming process i highly recommend checking out this video it show the right way to get amazing steam pressure from this machine', 'my first real espresso machine wa a silvia that i pid ed it wa very easy to do and i can highly recommend doing that if you want a silvia however i like a good cappuccino or flat white most of the time and so do many of my family member and friend and considering this a single boiler machine became very frustrating to me i am a little surprised that you did not touch on that in the video but then again there are no alternative in this budget range however to me if i wa shopping for a cheaper machine again i would not hesitate to add just a little extra and get a nuova simonelli oscar ii it is just so good value for the money', 'the rancilio wa my first and only espresso machine i have had it for 6 year if one is jumping into espresso there is is a learning curve with this machine that wa in my case quite frustrating i would do the same thing twice and get very different result learning how to temperature surf solved a lot of the problem then a new grinder and finally a scale now at least i could track parameter and my espresso ha become quite enjoyable to me i am not barista capable but i enjoy the machine would i do it again yes though i have become a bit ocd the journey ha been wonderful experience thank you for your youtube channel i have learned a lot here respectfully pt', 'completely agree with your conclusion james i started on a gaggia classic early 2000s model and it wa great but lacked steam power needed the opv mod to bring the pressure down portafilter is crap so got a bottomless and a vst basket got a 3d printed drip tray that is skinnier to give more space under the portafilter ims shower screen but it really excelled with a pid all in i honestly probably spent gbp200 odd extra on part for a machine i picked up for gbp100 on ebay i really can not fathom why they made the new classic pro still to have what 15 bar of pressure and a pressurised basket leave that to a cheap delonghi people spending gbp400 on a machine either want it to perform like a prosumer machine or they want a bean to cup not these weird half way machine i think the new machine just miss out on securing a potentially massive audience because they have targeted it wrong i am not on a lelit but a marax i absolutely love it their higher end machine though all come with 58mm portafilters i can not for the life of me work out why they would not apply this across the board why limit the tamper portafilter basket shower screen gasket etc that you can buy it doe not make any sense basically there is a fair few good machine here but they are all stuck in a limbo for me in between being a gimmicky toy aimed at newcomer with low budget and prosumer machine that offer so much more', 'starting from the 11 00 mark of this video it describes how to increase the steaming power of the gaggia', 'i bought a 2nd hand original gaggia classic opv tweaked to 10 bar only an allen key and pressure gauge needed 18g vst basket steam issue can be worked around by starting to steam before the thermostat reach temp that way it keep the heater element on otherwise a soon a the stat kick in it loos all power not felt the need for a pid yet a slight flush before pulling a shot and i very rarely get a drink i am not happy with all in gbp180 and about 20 minute work', 'i used to have a delonghi dedica a my first coffee machine a a hobbyist i made a few adjustment one being buying a bottomless portafilter and a standard basket like james did and it wa a lot of fun to play with you can also fit a silvia steam wand on it but it would take a couple of hour and some level of electrician knowledge which i do not have another trick only work on model ec685 will not work on ec680 is to remove the steam wand sleeve and use a zip tie to hold the plastic inner tube in place to steam milk which can let you control milk texture better since it will not inject air for you i later sold the dedica and bought a 2003 gaggia classic which wa a lot of fun to learn how to make espresso too this time around it is much easier to fit a silvia steam wand on the gaggia since the older model come with a plastic pannarello wand making espresso on the gaggia is more enjoyable to do it on the dedica but i can feel the frustration of the lack of steam power on the gaggia and i wa genuinely shock when i later sold it and bought an expobar home pulser the pulser being a hx machine can put out a crazily strong steaming power which took me quite a while to get used to', 'meyersfarber first of all the pod are aluminum not plastic and the reason ground coffee go stale is because of contact with air the coffee in the pod are sealed airtight now nespresso is far from great and it is not like i want to defend them but overexaggerating is a thing too', 'thanks for the video james i recently upgraded from the bambino plus to the silvia and the thing i had noticed the bambino wa very very finnicky to dial in it required coffee to be ground uncomfortably coarse and the result with very lightly roasted melbourne coffee wa subpar i also found that it could not maintain 9 bar of pressure consistently and led to many very frustrating brew the silvia is a tinkerer is dream built like a tank like you said i do not mind temperature surfing or the fact that it is a single boiler after a while flushing surfing becomes part of your routine in the same way that pre heating the portafilter doe one last thing is that sage product at least in australia a breville very often go on sale accordingly the bambino plus is placed at a very similar price point to that of the delonghi in australia check ozbargin for deal it often go for dollar350 aud 196 gbp at that price point it is significan notly cheaper than the silvia or gaggia and for someone who similar to me want to investigate if they want to adopt a pet called an espresso machine it is a strong recommendation however for someone who know espresso know what is involved in making it at home i would steer clear away from the bambino plus if possible while it can make decent espresso it can not really make great espresso and you will waste of much coffee trying to get to great espresso that it will not be worth it not a joy to use and not worth the hassle', 'i can echo this about the bambino i feel like i am consistently chasing a decent shot it is quite frustrating however i managed to pick one up for dollar330 when it wa on sale it made it a big selling point prior to going to a machine twice the price', 'probably pretty standard amount a regular people could consume quite a lot with mediocre coffee energy drink coke and tea brewing speciality coffee doe not have to change much', 'i bought and returned the dedica i also removed the plastic insert from the portafilter to use an unpressurised basket but blocked the extra hole by finding a small bolt of the right size and cutting it down however i still could not get satisfactory result and it wa just too inconsistent but in retrospect that could have been down to an issue with my one and possibly that the basket wa not great form size for a small kitchen is very good though not really a milky drink person so can not comment on steaming if space and budget are limited it is not bad but would quickly become frustrating if you are on a learning curve now have a la pavoni so espresso is way more frustrating and fun', 'a superb and brief group reveiw simply leaf the others behind the comparison on brew temp and brew pressure are spot on and ditto their steaming power bravo', 'i have had the gaggia classic for a couple month now and have not done any mod yet i find the steam ready light is not a very good indicator and i have seen it described online a the too late light i found a huge difference in my milk texture and steam power when i started steaming 20 second after flipping the steam switch rather than waiting for the light to go back on', 'you are on about the 20 power up and on the comment above on the change to a bottomless portafilter and vst or ims basket one mod i would suggest is the variation in your recipe to a higher gram in to make use of the higher pressure from the machine i find that 19 20g yield better result for transparency of tasting note when not using dark roast because of my time with the gaggia classic pro i think i am more ready to spend the extra cash for a machine that give me more ability to adjust these input ie brew temp brew pressure steam timing and consistency such a model from ecm rocket etc and of course grinder are important so do not skimp there at all fortunately for me i can get the same or better personal espresso quality taste and art from this machine than i get from the local coffee shop in town using their local roast i am on this journey so i am really enjoying the experience and of course this channel for the wisdom', 'i am keen to try this i just switched out the steam wand to rancilio silvia on my 2014 gaggia classic and have been really disappointed with the result steam power tends to die halfway through and it doe not seem to be a problem with the thermostat or anything like that thanks for the tip', 'i own a gaggia classic the older model and the milk streaming would not be a problem at all with this tip after the steam light come on open the valve and let the steam flow after about 10 15 you will hear the steam power drop the boiler then kick in to heat up the steam power would kick up again after just about a few second keep the valve open the entire time so that you hear the steam power change and that is when i dig my pitcher in the general time spent would be longer of course but you get a much better experience the steam power then is really nice and in the pitcher there is a roaring whirlpool', 'a a long time rancillio silvia user i can tell you the temperature surfing becomes frustrating if your spending that much money save a little more for a better machine otherwise you become frustrated like me and start using a moka pot more often', 'yes it is no competition i own the nera and it is super consistent hx are the best type in my opinion because you get fresh water drawn from the reservoir for the shot instead of boiler water the steam is on tap no extra waiting just make sure the portafilter is hot before you pull any shot whole latte love did some scace device test recently for the nera fyi', 'i have my bezzera connected to a z wave power plug so i can switch it on from my

3pm and will turn the machine off', 'excellent video a always i will be very interested to hear what you have to say about the silvia pro it ha a dual boiler and a built in pid so temp should be easier to control and more consistent it is also over double the price of the standard silvia which is frustrating but i still think worth a test', 'hi james happy dedica owner here a is ispecially with the stock portafilter the espresso it pull is really bad really need a naked portafilter to get away with much finer grind to get decent espresso though i think pulling a shot with 18g in is asking too much from this machine using recipe between 14g to 15 5g in 30g out 8and the shot i get are decent oh yeah i think the old dedica 650 is better for milk steaming the new nozzle on the 680

content', 'drinking my morning flat white which i just made on my gaggia classic pro to all people who are thinking about buying the gaggia you can get more steam power for a longer period of time if you begin steaming before the steam ready light is illuminated when you do this the heating element remains on during the steaming process allowing a higher steam pressure sustained for longer allowing a faster and better textured milk steaming', 'i have the gaggia and had a similar experience with the steaming sometimes it is really powerful and that is often when i have left it on for a while or when i have maybe caught it just at that right point of temperature it is made great espresso a far a i can tell but it ha not been a consistent a i would like modding it is on my list of

commercial standard heavyweight 58mm with the classic you will of course want a grinder a well interestingly we like the breville smart grinder pro a an economical companion to the classic you will probably be able to pull better shot with a separate grinder the 16 grind setting on the baristas built in grinder can be limiting like other breville product the sgp is considered by some a more of an appliance a opposed to a machine but should be fine for le demanding home use the classic is machine grade v the b barista appliance the classic is user serviceable if you are so inclined we generally do not recommend breville owner go inside the case another big difference is steaming it is autofrothing on the classic and commercial style manual on the breville it is tough to get a latte art capable microfoam with an autofrothing wand but the breville is not exactly a steaming powerhouse when compared to prosumer level hx and db machine both machine are single boiler sbdu so there is waiting for steam with both and manual cooling down required on the classic after steaming but we prefer the classic is boiler which contains a volume of water over the breville is thermocoil which is an on demand system with some practice and proper use the classic probably ha better temperature stability in the end the classic should produce better espresso when paired with a good grinder and user skill the breville doe okay but trade off some potential quality for ease of use hope that help let u know if you have any more question', 'deirdre harness if your water is a hard a it seems i

nespresso line of machine the lattissima pro wa released in early 2014 a the top end lattissima machine with the lattissima plus being the main steam offering since the the lattissima range ha undergone quite a visual change but for some reason this pro model is still the same machine that wa released in 2014 and personally i think it look rather dated the other issue i see is that it suffers with the typical lattissima problem of luke warm coffee when making a milk based drink i honestly thought this pro model had a temperature setting but after watching this video it is clear it doe not what i can not seem to understand is why nespresso have not seemed to address this luke warm coffee issue that seems inherent in the lattissima range there is no way a milk based drink would be coming out of these machine at le than 65c when prepared and should be closer to 68c 70c to be getting 59c is just not hot enough and like i have mentioned in the past i have seen old lattissima plus not getting higher that 50c but classed a within specification by nespresso i am really sorry to bang the same old drum for me it is got to be a nespresso requirement that these lattissima machine can not make a milk drink hotter a my delonghi pain in the as to use bean to cup machine with auto latte system that these nespresso machine are based on ha no issue serving milk based drink at 70c consistently it also seems like the creatista range can be up to 10c hotter on the milk drink also so i just do not understand why these lattissima machine are not able to match the 65c 68c with milk based drink of the creatista range again the review is great and are a pleasure to watch a i try to decide which new nespresso machine to buy have a great week joff', 'i just bought this machine 3 day ago and i am already having problem with it this morning i tried to pull an espresso and very little water wa extracted then it stopped and an error message came up on display saying system empty repeat delivery nespresso i had to restart over this time it worked however i had that message before also the power cord is way to short for my kitchen it only like 50cm or so that is very annoying have to buy an extension cord which wasnt my idea to have hanging around the kitchen counter i can not help to feel that this machine is cheap made and they are selling it for a premium i am on live chat with nespresso now will advise later']","['i just opened for the first time and i can not get it to heat the water nothing happens from step 5 on the startup very frustrating',

could not start it again i dig in internet but no where there is an instruction how to restart the process and the worst thing is that it made the first process but it stopped on the rinse process so i could not use it now because it is not rinsed from the descale agent i am afraid to use it like this and can not enjoy my lovely coffee please help guy because delonghi are not very helpful any suggestion guy', 'i had the issue where the process would not start light flashing steam valve opened but then nothing i left the machine in that state for about 15 minute and the machine powered itself off same a if you leave machine on after making a drink once off i powered back on and pressed the descale button light flashing a per video then reopened the milk frother but quicker than previously rather than move it slowly a i did before and the descale process ha started this time no idea if machine reset itself after it powered off or by opening the milk valve quickly ha resolved

to today standard i settled for a melitta bean to cup in the end thank you for your video from 12 year ago haha', 'just bought this machine and already i have regretted it the amount of electricity it

homemade automatic coffee machine on kickstarter or just make some for review people the problem is that it is 3750w power consumption is too high for a uk plug 750 of those watt are just the

current magnifica model', 'the coffee quality is indeed great bought from the only misgiving i would have about using it are that the knob have no user marking which mean that if there are several people in the house using the machine it is impossible to select the previously selected individual setting also the time before the machine performs an auto switchoff is fixed at about three hour i could not find the power comsumption in the user manual when in idle mode but i think it must be substantial since it keep the boiler cup preheater hot during this time not that the preheater is any use i warm my cup by first wetting them and then putting them in the microwave for 30 second', 'interesting and relevant comparison but having recently purchased the 220v version of the delonghi esam 4200s which seems to only differ on minor cosmetic point i think you are selling the full auto a bit short it ha 13 grind setting numbered 1 to 7 with intermediate position click the bean hopper is smaller than stated it is around 1 2 lb 200g per the operating manual the panarello can be removed a shown for cleaning in which case one can get much better foam with experience and skill a is the case with any machine assuming the dial setting on the display model and mine are comparable i would expect a watery coffee with too little coffee for the amount of water setting the water dial to 9 00 and the coffee dial to 3 00 would give much better result slightly over 1oz in the cup with around 9g of dried coffee ground for best result i would recommend purging the steam wand and then inserting it into the milk container push the steam button and wait for the light before purging after steaming milk and turning off the steam button i suggest purging the steam wand for a few second until water come out of it the machine is then ready for coffee in second it is not a perfect machine it is a bit plasticky compared to the gaggia titanium it replaced at home the water tank is small the steam wand only swivel and it requires some tuning to give good result the range of the coffee and especially water amount is excessively large but with some tlc it make pretty good coffee and work well the startup time is fairly short probably because plastic ha little thermal inertia cleaning is very simple it lack some comfort feature compared to other full automatic presets autostart informative lcd display etc but it provides fine control which some of the fancier machine lack i understand that it is pretty reliable hopefully it will beat the 14 year i got from the gaggia and that the internals are identical to the fancier delonghi model which make me feel smug i am silent on the 4 setting temperature control a temperature seems to vary quite a bit from pour to pour unfortunately hot water is delivered on the steam wand at a consistent 90c 195f but brewed coffee in cup vary from 58 135f to 65 150f depending on setting and shot overall not much to complain for the price', 'hi i use same coffee maker a you whenever i turn on the power it rinse so the water come out from the coffee nozzle how can i set the auto rinse off', 'faststrike fast yeah yeah that is fine it just keep the energy to european energy saving standard if you want to turn it off it tell you in the manual', 'teclarism this may be a bit late but yes it can you can draw hot water at a temperature of roughly 90 c 195 f from the steam wand', 'the depth from the back to the front without the drip tray is 25 5cm or 10 inch the width of the device without the drip tray is 28cm or 11

like from the others do you have a video that you go over what is needed to make the espresso a video for people that are new to this in this video you keep going over thing that wa not good but you did not say what wa needed you said at 4 08 there wa no gauge if there wa a gauge what would you want to see the pressure or the temp of the water or both is the amount of pressure the water is being pressed out into the basket important if so what psi do you want i have a steamer and it ha a pressure regulator switch in it i can turn the adjustable screw on the top of the switch to set the pressure of steam that come out there is a pipe that go from the tank to a pressure gauge so it not a big deal to add a pressure gauge and a adjustable pressure switch when the pressure i set is reached it shuts off the power to the heater that go around tank i guess when i am controlling the pressure in the tank i am controlling the temp of the water so i guess what i would like to know is what is more important in making good espresso the pressure it coming out or the temp of the water or both what is the magic pressure or temp wanted at 9 03 you said the delonghi doe not have a

finer grind i guess this is to do with the basket doe anyone know if it is worth getting a regular basket for any of these machine or altering anything else or is the reason for the pressurised basket

decent espresso from it but at a huge cost to the pleasurable experience of making a morning espresso to me a machine like this although apparently an accessible to all option really actually is only going to make decent coffee if used by one of u who know the trick of the trade and at that point why would we put ourselves through the pain of using one of these other that pure budget issue like

sold in aldi ireland a good few year back and wa actually made on delonghi part when i opened it up after it broke it had most of delonghi inside i bought an unpressurised basket for it and managed with a bit to care to pull good shot for that machine is standard no channelling when it gave up the ghost i could not repair it myself and i found this one from andrew james which wa identical to the aldi one with one extra tweak very handy the on off button timer the machine would power off after 5 minute of not being used it wa a good machine for the price and i have enjoyed it it broke within the guarantee and andrew james replaced with a newer model the one you have reviewed which upon initial try i returned to the company with a note that it truly is a de improvement and it is awful and i forfeit my right to the guaranteed repair replacement i bought another second hand on ebay that one broke a month ago and i wa given used gaggia cubika plus which damn you gaggia ha the most horrible portafilter i have ever seen with some finicky mechanism inside of it and it truly is a piece of garbage and there is no alternative portafilter to buy unless you know one and i did not

pressurized one that modification along with an ordered tamper and secondhand rancilio md50 grinder are what ha led to to where i am today it wa frustrating finicky and not a good user experience but it made good espresso when effort care and time wa put into it since then i switched a a vintage la pavoni europicola that i refurbished i still dislike my routine it is clunky can not support multiple beverage for company and i have grown to really dislike this grinder but it is my setup and i love it', 'all i have access to is a cheap machine a capresso ec 110 which ha given me some pretty good shot of espresso however the caveat to that is the issue of consistency it just is not consistent trying to get the best shot i possibly can from it is frustrating but i love to play around with it and have fun trying to get just the right grind and pressure to get the best shot i can usually take about 3 try and then it dialed in for a while and i get good coffee for a bit and then it wont take the grind or the pressure is too much or it leak around the portafilter from the group head but it give me just enough good coffee to not want to throw it in the trash i think it know', 'this is sadly where i am at right now ekeing out what i can while preparing for a real upgrade skipping over the gcp entry level and to at least hx if not db current machine klarstein

exact same pressurized basket and plastic wand tamper i pair it with a serviceable virtuoso which give me about 7 8 espresso grind step my first step wa to depressurize the portafilters but have since just bought a non pressurized basket from amazon that certainly helped immensely my next ideal mod however not sure if it is possible a i have not found a way and documentation is sorely lacking would be to lower the pressure from 15 bar to 9 bar unfortunately like a couple of the machine in the video i get a minor jet stream that cause channeling it appears unrelated to the shower screen although i have considered replacing that too i do not even want to talk about the thought of temp surfing or piding the thermoblock all in all i pull fine shot not great that mostly just end up in iced latte i just live with the fomo that come along with not getting everything out of my trade subscription the one positive i have learned a lot about the process and creating consistency in the step i can control it is also proven to myself based on sustained daily use that this is a hobby i enjoy and want to get better at thus justifying the cash outlay for a significan not upgrade investment', 'can you review flair espresso and any hand powered machine below 300 pound i use flair in my shop idk if it proper', 'hi james my first and unfortunately still current machine is the delonghi ecp33 21 that i bought for exactly gbp100 a few year ago terrible choice yes but i did not know what i wa getting into so i wanted to learn the basic skill instead of going head first and grab the best equipment of course the first thing i immediately realised after the purchase wa how hard it is to get the grind consistency i want using a blade grinder so i bought an entry level grinder called graef cm702 for another gbp100 soon after i also found a gbp8 non pressurized basket that fit the 51mm portafilter although i needed to unscrew the plastic inside after that i finally had some satisfaction pulling good shot unassisted by the pressurised basket but it did not take long before the inconsistency of the tool started to become a wall and i never found the reason nor courage to explore beyond the lavazzas and sicals of espresso bean because the shot i wa pulling were too inconsistent i would probably waste about 40percent of the bag just from bad shot and adjustment dial in

quite liked the cappucino modern style frother the end froth seems to be too airy and especially the one that came with my machine is a pain in the arse to clean you have to take it apart and scrub them everytime because the milk get stuck in weird corner and the wall in the frother even after you flushed it sexy lever switch clean look comfortably sized pid for the tem variant and seems like a robust little machine go for euros430 but stock seems to not always be available p s if you have actually read this i might a well go ahead and get a few question in 1 thermoblock v boiler is it really worth the price difference i found a dual thermoblock machine that go for around gbp550 just above the pricepoint for entry level boiler machine with no immediately obvious shortcoming and wa wondering if the convenience and price outweighs the difference in feature and quality anyway 2 are those built in grinder in espresso machine actually any good is the difference in grind quality worth the space saving and the price 3 am i crazy or bean from the same bag really do need grind adjustment a they lose freshness i already suspect my 40 grind setting too cheap to be true grinder but it seems to work great for a few day then need a step up or two to get the same grind profile i am conflicted on whether it is something i have to be personally mindful of or is it time for an upgrade

having okay decent for me burr grinder generally i do find drinking expresso by itself quite a sharp taste for me then when making a cappuccino latte i think it taste pretty good i think it is a good starter machine but i have had to learn how the machine work to try and get a nice result out of it the steam wand is a bit small and i have felt during the milk steaming process it can drop in pressure then regains it is power again halfway through still learning the whole milk art also but is it is fun and enjoyable still i am no expert but at this moment it is better than paying 2 4 pound for a coffee in a brighton cafe and i feel it is a half decent machine for me a i have a compact kitchen i have been looking into seeing if i can get a bottomless port filter for the machine to see if

way i see it is that i will improve my machine the moment i get bored with the current one and sell this one a a beginner machine a i have bought myself for 20 euro for me it wa not the great taste i wa into at first but rather whether i will do it at all spending 100 on a single machine before knowing is for me personally a big chunk of money of which you can not know you are up for it my other choice would have been gaggia classic and delonghi dedica ec 685 opinion on the gaggia were that it doe not hold to it quality of the way it wa built in the past so i backed off on this with the dedica i always said to myself to buy it but then again i had to pay around 150 to 200 at once this is not the only issue the you need a good grinder i have the very first hario hand mill back before it got more expensive bought it around 2013 i considered buying the baratza encore a everyone say it is good enough for a start but then again you need to lay down 80 euro or so then there is the tamper or should i rather buy the jack espresso leveler recommended from whole latte love you see there are too many option or upgrade to consider to drink espresso properly that i kind of shyd away

also a bit frustrating i leave the puck to cool enough to handle before putting the ground in the bin and rinse the porta filter under the tap after use i find this address the usability issue when

year a a first step into espresso making it originally came with 2 different sized pressurized basket with rubber gasket inside when these started to wear out i wa relieved to be able to upgrade to a

technique and current understanding of espresso brewing having a grinder that doe not allow a fine tuning of the grind setting made me learn a lot about brewing espresso i have learned how to play with the dose to overcome the not so great grinding right now i can brew espresso within the correct brewing time and tasting great also saving money in the setup allows me to spend more money on what
