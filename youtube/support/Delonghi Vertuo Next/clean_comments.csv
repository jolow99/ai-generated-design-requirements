1,i do not understand with this bluetooth that is build in what people can control the nespresso machine from their own bed to make coffee for them,greattttt very thorough review,,hi erin i like the outfit you have on what brand is it pls and thanks it look great on you,i have got a keurig 2 0 probably 7 8 year old and a nespresso vertuo past 2 year side by side on my counter i enjoy good quality cafe coffee and yes even starbucks mostly i want just coffee over say espresso or latte but i do enjoy those i use the keurig probably 4 to 1 over the nespresso latte at home with nespresso is good but definitely far from a properly created latte at a coffee shop regular coffee though i have found a couple k cup i like such a costco is kirkland pacific bold that cost around dollar 30 cup cdn or starbucks verona a well for about dollar 50 70 per cup but the bigger issue i have is the 7 77oz size of the full cup nespresso v getting a 10oz from keurig they have the alto size but just two flavour good but not great imo and at 14oz just too large they temperature is not a big deal unless you add milk cream but is quite a bit cooler than keurig starbucks ha just started selling vertuo pod at grocery store but it is a bit of a head scratcher that 8 pod is dollar10 v about 12 k cup for the same money i have tried side by side and despite the crema they taste very similar i am guessing the aluminum pod just cost more i just wish nespresso would start offering a 9 77oz size to fill my cup a bit more anyway great review,great feedback andrew thank you,your video are getting better and better,thanks pablo,nice video fun and informative thank you,judging by your last few review you really are a coffee lover always good to see independent review though,erin lawrence my pleasure enjoy your review and the info you provide,thanks,erin is gorgeous with this dress,thanks erin,nice review perhaps the app provides info back to nespresso on how customer are using their machine and which capsule they are purchasing they might be using it for marketing reason which are rather underhanded,true,i had to look up what a canadian double double wa far from y all here in south texas love the review thanks for sharing,thank you and now you have to try a double double,good sunday afternoon to you all from wellington somerset in the uk,thanks for stopping by the channel,whaoo,you are looking fantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

doe the crema really improve after 5 10 extraction to be honest this is not a deal breaker for me but it would still be interesting to know if it really improves,the crema will improve over 5 10 extraction if the issue persists please contact a machine technician via our toll free number 800 562 1465,if i buy this directly from the nespresso site doe it come with the complimentary welcome kit of pod every other retailer ha it included with the machine best buy walmart target etc but i do not see it stated on the nespresso site that this machine come with the kit,yes it doe,my new machine will not start the rescaling process the orange light in blinking can i get some assistance,brooke make sure the iswitch lock into position all the way to the left not just hovering over the lock symbol,eleni antoniou what wa the trick,eleni antoniou you should share it here,nespresso the service team have not been able to help me in the past but thankfully the comment online have been of lot of help i got my third machine to work and it wa another customer commenting that did the trick,hi helen we are disappointed to hear this we would recommend contacting our technical team when you are

first coffee it wa so good however after i opened up the top part again and emptied the capsule i noticed that there wa still a lot of water left on the capsule placement is this normal i would hate it if it is because if water stay immobile for too long that is no good my old keurig machine never left any water after every use could anyone let me know if there is a solution or do i have to wipe it after every use thanks,mine doe the exact same thing please let me know if you found a solution to it it would be well appreciated,we will be happy to check and ensure the machine is working properly william please contact a machine technician via our toll free number 800 562 1465,is the used capsule supposed to automatically go into the container mine stay put and i manually take it out,you have to make sure the machine is completely unlocked and top lift completely to eject capsule into compartment i use the breville nespresso virtuo next and have had no issue just wish i drank regular or 2percent milk because my oat milk will not froth,hi susan it should slide into the capsule chamber when you open the machine if you are having trouble with it please call u at 1 800 562 1465 for further assistance,i like how i am asked which country i am located by nespresso staff here and then when you provide the location you are ignored now my unit is leaking water from the top right side it is disintegrating in about a week is time also one thing to be aware unlike the other smaller pod you are stuck purchasing the vertuo pod from nespresso is website or store you can not buy them at a local store,paul thomas you should absolutely do research on electrical equipment it take a couple minute for real people could then see it is more of a premium cafe style machine not a gas station equivalent k cup machine style nicer thing cost more if the machine is not working correctly get a refund it ha a warranty what are the gotcha moment you are speaking of,you should not have to research a coffee pot plus i got mine a a gift so it is a bit late to do research a decent manufacturer product should work well and not have gotchas it should work amp be worth the mfg is price these are not used car or off brand product,sa i am not worked all up i am stating the obvious i am not in canada so i get your concern here we can purchase at target walmart amazon online they have an ongoing patent that go until like 2027 if i recall if your machine is acting up yes you are correct to contact the company,adeezl leak and wifi not working concerning the capsule i specifically mentioned one thing to be aware i did not go through the warranty it went straight back to the store it came from and now that i am at it there are no more target in canada in response to another comment that is my experience with the machine not sure why you get all worked up,why not do some research before buying such a device that is like buying a power tool and complaining that you have to use a certain replacement part only from a certain store leak are another thing and are covered under warranty but a for the capsule being a specialty premium item you should know what you are buying before doing it,so i connected my machine to the app but i can not figure out how to brew coffee from the app is it even possible or not someone help please,do not think so above they said it wa for rescaling amp water warning,nespresso fresno ca usa,thanks for reaching out in order to serve you please let u know in which country you are located,nespresso no the manual doe not show you how to brew from the app on the phone,let u know if the user manual is not helpful chris,can this machine make espresso coffee,yes,doe this machine work not connected to wifi,absolutely nick,app is crummy could not login properly after registering something about not your store i did password reset and then i wa able to login now i can not connect to the wifi give me a break closed the app and reopened now it connects to wifi but say your internet doe not work real junky app,nespresso so like any update mine is also having the same issue,nespresso canada,thanks for reaching out in order to serve you please let u know in which country you are located,do i need to have wifi to use this machine,i think a better question is why would a coffee machine only be able to be used from an app watch their other video if you need you do not have to pair anything to your wifi there is a button on the top you put your capsule in and press it once the machine ha heated up,the machine ha connectivity capability it can still be used normally without this feature,how can they not answer this simple question,thanks for reaching out in order to serve you please let u know in which country you are located,first machine would not pair second one is ungodly loud and the coffee doe not froth wow what a waste of money,my parent got one of these machine and the side is broken and the pre wash is also broken we got it new from target but it will not work the side is not the side with the opening part it is not supposed to be open at all the lower clip thing that keep the side in is too low i think and it will not stay on any way to fix this,i had the vertuo and it just stopped working a well i wa lucky it happened in 2 week i wa able to get my money back,thanks for confirming a machine technician will gladly assist in resolving the issue via our toll free u number 800 562 1465,nespresso do you mean where i am contacting you from a in where i live i got the machine from target in washington state usa if you meant something else please let me know what information you need me to tell you,hello we are sorry about that please let u know where are you contacting u from so we could further assist you,i turn the machine on and the button blink orange twice then turn to a steady white again when i press the button 3 time nothing happens the water is in the tank there is so capsule in the machine is something wrong with the machine,nicki narloch i actually hate this nesspresso next machine the manual is a pile of junk i thought i wa stupid and the only one having problem but it turn out that many customer have the same issue i paid far too much for this machine to not even be able to get a full cup of coffee,justin mahmud thanks what a simple but effective tip,casita hind family totally agree i also know it wa a common problem because of how much the point wa emphasized on the call they should really add it to the instruction manual because it is not very intuitive,justin mahmud thank you it is the easiest resolve ever logically it make sense to put the level on the lock not passed it,just fixed this after getting off the phone with them it ended up being a simple solve but something i assume most ppl are messing up when locking the machine you have to twist past the lock symbol i had it turned right on the lock which led to the same orange blinking twice issue when pressing three time after locking fully the cleaning process worked fine,i did this and there wa a small puddle of water in the pod holder after it wa completed is this normal,adeezl ever hear of cleaning thing,nespresso although normal a per their standard both my machine next and plus deluxe produce this it should not be happening stagnant cold water is no good a per culinary regulation you get bacteria in that puddle it end up being inputted into our cup you can check because after you brew it the water is gone the machine somehow pull the water through the tank and do this,hi joe a small amount of water in the capsule container is normal,30 second to warm up only functioning through the app why do company keep making crappy decision,30 second to warm is is very fast compared to k cup style machine your comment make no sense you can use the machine without pairing anything to your home network you literally just press the one button on the whole machine it is idiot proof horrible comment thumb down,nespresso why do you think i need any help,hello can you please tell u your country of living so we can help you,you lost me at phone pairing,best way for sucker to get hacked is to connect coffee machine and dish washer to the internet,it is bloody 1984 all over again i am just going to go back to proper coffee machine if this is how it is going to be,right smh,well said my coffee moment are old fashion analog off line break one day my 2010 le cube nespresso is going to stop working when that happens if my only choice require me to pair device or have internet i will go back to filter coffee in a heartbeat,the aito kun and here ha ha ha ha ha,this is so helpful a the manual is garbage,augustus landen instablaster,agreed,i know right haha,agreed,i am also sticking with the plus thank you very much,it not working to connect with bluetooth,how frustrating dina please contact a machine technician for support at 800 562 1465,nespresso plus is much better,what is the point of the app can you use the machine without the app,hi you can use the machine without the app with the app you can get alert like descaling reminder and water tank alert,what is the difference between the premium and deluxe version of the next model,bjarke jensen which one they all brew excellent coffee but all the latest model including the vertuo plus seems to be built like crap according to the majority of review,just buy another model not the next model,deluxe ha stainless steel,hi josie thanks for your question they differ in color only,i downloaded the app tried to pair with my phone but it did not work i even tried calling the customer service but did not could not solve it is my machine defected,the inability to pair seems to be a consistent problem that no one can help with frustrating this alone make me wish i went with a different brand,i am in the u and having the same issue a everyone vertuo next,nespresso i have the app paired with a prodigio a i use the scheduling feature for morning coffee i have just acquired a vertuo next deluxe and want to pair it with the app mainly for the software update but it is not being find by the app the machine bluetooth wifi facility is on any suggestion,zosime22 yes i did a reset and powered off on my phone,edward h that may have been my error i only restarted my router did you reset the nespresso machine before or after restarting your router and modem from reading your comment it sound like before but i just want to confirm,is the app necessary for the usage of the machine,nespresso ah yes i know that the app doe not work in the uae and the only machine that could use the app is the barista although i would like to hear any update regarding the app service here in the uae many thanks,hello can you please tell u your country of living so that we could help you,warning do not download their app these innocent programme are totally unnecessary you are simply making coffee they want you to install their app so they can steal data from your mobile phone did you hear about whatsapp user were shocked when they discovered their personal data wa being stolen the only reason manufacturer encourage you to install an app on your phone is to find out who you are and discover your buying habit concerned about your security avoid all apps,adeezl you need a brain transplant unfortunately there is a very long waiting list for that procedure,adeezl if i told you the earth wa flat would you believe me,i guess you guy do not read the text in the video they do not sell your info re watch 2 01 stop the fake complaint,concerned about your security do not buy a smart phone or get a fb google twitter account
3,hab schon 2 maschinen vom typ in den m ll entsorgt nur probleme gemacht,offenbar wurde hier bei den maschinen nachgebessert ich hab meine vertuo next seit 1 monat und hab keine der beschrieben probleme kein wasser im auffangbeh lter oder in der kapselhalterung und auch noch nie probleme mit der crema,tolles video wa mich noch interessieren w rde ist ob man die menge dosieren kann in deinem video kam eine anst ndige menge raus bei meiner probemaschine kommt 1 schluck raus,nein da ist ja der vorteil an dem vertuo system die kapseln werden aufgrund de barcodes ausgelesen und immer auf die gleiche art zubereitet du kannst aber die wassermenge je nach kapselgr e barcode selber neu programmieren die programmierung geht aber dann je original size typ mug 230ml espresso 40ml etc l sst du manuell also zb statt der 230 bei mug nur 180 ml einlaufen dann wird diese neue einstellung bei allen mug arten intensio stormio odacio etc bernimmen sprich die neuprogrammierung geht nicht nach kaffeart sondern nach f llmengenart dieser punkt tut mir auch extrem weh da w re eigentlich der beste punkt da ber die app zum ver ndern so ist da pairing und die app eigentlich total sinnlos,wirklich guter ton 10 10 punkte,die maschine ist eine vollkatastrophe nach 2 tagen lief berall au der maschine wasser heraus im netz liest man viel davon absolut lebensgef hrlich diesis ger t,i have 1 question is there any other capsels other marke for this machine or only nespresso i ask that because from my old model nespresso machine i can also bought marke from lidl or netto for not soo much money tnx,leider noch nicht,gutes video und vor allem ehrlich viele bewerben ja nur die positiven aspekte,wa ist der unterschied zwischen krups und delonghi,sehr schade da die lautst rke w hrend der zubereitung nicht gezeigt wurde ansonsten eine sch ne review,ich habe die maschine wegen der carafe portion ich finde die maschine sehr schwerg ngig aber vor allen viel zu laut ist da bei dir auch so laut wegen crema usw da st rt mich weniger ich habe hier auch keinen vergleich das etwas kaffee nach hinten tropft kenne ich von der classic kapsel mschine ebenfalls,sorry aber wer nespresso kauft und trinkt hat von kaffee keine ahnung bzw keinen guten geschmack nespresso ist au er teuer nix der kaffee schmeckt grauenhaft k nstlich und sau teuer bevor ich nespresso trinke trinke ich gar keinen kaffee e gibt weit bessere maschinen die viel besseren kaffee machen am besten sind sowieso frische bohnen gemahlen,sehr sch n ich habe sie mir aber trotzdem gekauft weil sie nun nicht mehr so viel creme produziert wie die alte,ich kann nicht verstehen weshalb ein neues vertuo modell auf den markt gekommen ist da ltere modell vertuo plus hat im vergleich mehr vorteile und ist zudem auch viel hochwertiger verarbeitet hab mir auf jedenfall die plus geg nnt,sehe ich genauso,bei mir ist der kaffee immer fast kalt habe dieselbe maschine in schwarz,wir haben auch eine vertuo next die gleiche maschine wie du aber da problem mit der crema haben wir nicht wir haben eine wunderbare crema wenn man sie sogar direkt nach der zubereitung umr hrt bleibt sie l nger da die bluetooth und wlan m gichkeit k nnte man nat rlich noch mehr rausholen wie du da gesagt hast dennoch wirklich cool das so neue update z b bei neuen kapseln gemacht werden k nnen wir sind sehr zufrieden erw hnen m chten wir noch das wir vorher einen vollautomaten hatten der die schlechtere crema hatte al die vertuo von unserer seite au k nnen wir nur gutes sagen,alle prozesse gegen die fremdanbieter der kapseln verloren und jetzt kommen sie damit an nix da freunde lass mich doch nicht ver ppeln und wenn ich einen kaffee will dr ck ich auf den knopf und kaffee kommt wa die hier anbieten ist l cherlicher firlefanz,ja die einen sind mit brauner br he und denken e sein ein guter kaffee die anderen wollen gute qualit t die auch noch nachhaltig ist nespresso kunden sch tzen den hochwertigen kaffee da schmeckt man auch nespresso hat nix verloren weil die nachmacher ja berhaupt nicht an die qualit t von nespresso ran kommen mitbewerber die nur da system und die kaffeemaschinen von nespresso nutzen verwenden ja auch kein hochwertigen pr mienkaffee ohne fehlbohnen wie die mitbewerber,an sich ja alles okay nur die maschine verliert nicht grunds tzlich wasser direkt im kapselbeh lter die maschine ist neu auf dem markt und befindet sich noch im sogenannten eder prozess da hei t fehler m ssen gefunden und behoben werden da hei t wenn die maschine von anfang an ausl uft zur ckgeben glaubt mir ich kenne mich au,am anfang war ich von der maschine begeistert klar die kapseln sind h llisch teuer von der umwelt sauerei einmal ganz zu schweigen aber der kaffee schmeckt fantastisch und sieht auch wirklich au wie in der fernsehwerbung dann hat sich aber nach 2 monaten die elektronik oder die software selbst zerlegt jedenfalls spinnt sie nur noch rum und macht keinen kaffee mehr die maschine ist kaputt laut nestle ein totalschaden nun berlegt man dort ob man mir kulanter weise eine neue maschine schickt oder mir doch nur den mittelfinger zeigt antwort steht noch au,new style television leider ist der service wirklich schlimm wir haben von schreien bi auflegen schon echt alles durch selbstverst ndlich ist da ger t dort registriert e find zb damit an das eine r ck berweisung zwei monate gedauert hat da haben un schon echt die worte gefehlt nur jetzt wo die mitarbeiter scheinbar keinen plan von ihrem produkten haben so zumindest die aussage am telefon bei sowas fehlen mir komplett die worte ich glaube wir mussten drei wochen lang anrufen um einen reparatur auftrag zu bekommen bin gespannt ob die abholung tat chlich statt finden wird bisher nur rger gehabt,update die maschine wurde zwischenzeitlich repariert und funktioniert nun tadellos allerdings wurde die bluetooth funktion deaktiviert ich vermute das e damit probleme gab jedenfalls bin ich jetzt erstmal wieder zufrieden,mz man mus die maschine direkt nach dem kauf mit der seriennummer bei nespresso registrieren und sich dort ein kundenkonto anlegen dann bekommt man einen hervorragenden service klar war e rgerlich das meine maschine zweimal hintereinander kaputt gegangen ist aber der kundendienst an sich war extrem freundlich kompetent und zuvorkommend,andreas deutscher dann mus nespresso dringend an seiner kommunikation arbeiten al ich im bekanntenkreis erz hlt habe das ich mir eine nespresso maschine gekauft habe erntete ich einen regelrechten shitstorm wegen der kapseln,andreas deutscher inzwischen ist alles gekl rt die maschine wurde repariert allerdings bekam sie ein software update d h die bluetooth funktion zur koppelung an die nespresso app wurde deaktiviert wa aber nicht weiter schlimm ist denn jetzt kann man die zubereitung neuer kaffeesorten manuell programmieren vermutlich war die firmware die fehlerquelle,kann mir jemand sagen wie hoch die maschine ist wenn der deckel aufgeklappt ist also wenn ich die maschine unter einen schrank stellen m chte danke,flo ziereis danke,ziemlich genau 45cm mit ge ffnetem deckel,tolles test video nur ein kleiner kritikpunkt die eingespielten sound sind ein bisschen nervig,gut gemacht vielen dank,danke f r deine m he,da video ist so schlecht gemacht aber danke daf r,which language is this,ysrnaw wenn dann schon german schreiben,deutsch,tschibokapseln f r reiche,der unterschied liegt eindeutig in der besseren kaffee qualit t nespresso verarbeitet keinen b rsenkaffe mit viele fehlbohnen wie andere kaffee anbieter kenner von nespresso sch tzen die nachhaltige qualit t und anstrengungen f r den naturschutz und umwelt qualit t hat halt seinen preis immer frischen kaffee dank der kapseln,danke f r da video aber sorry diese furchtbare hintergrundmusik ist katastrophal und diese dummen und nervigen buh und jubel sample im video sind absolut nervig,kasimir m find super wie du da durchaus wahre leider sehr unfreundlich formulierte feedback aufnimmst king,da stimmt wohl extrem nervig,danke f r die r ckmeldung merk ich mir mal,sofort wieder verkauft da ist keine crema sondern widerlicher bittererschaum ganz bles ger t der trick mit dem barcode ist noch verzeihlich,andreas deutscher da k nnen wir deine meinung teilen haben sie seit einigen tagen und sind sehr zufrieden auch der milchschaum der ist sogar besser al der unseres vollautomaten wir haben herausgefunden wenn man die crema nach der zubereitung umr hrt h lt die crema l nger,wohl die falsche milch oder die beschreibung nicht gelesen bei meiner vertuo ist alles auch der milchschaum top wa soll da mit dem barcode wo soll da ein trick sein,gute erkl rung und ehrlichkeit,vieles falsch in diesem bericht 1 e gibt bi 70euros verg nstigung ber die kaffeekanne und jede menge kapseln 2 bei meiner maschine war noch nie ein wasserr ckstand im br hbereich 3 die crema ist wesentlich besser wie bei meinen 6 vorg ngermaschinen einschlie lich ventura alt 4 warum kann man nicht mal abwarten wa nespresso noch an software liefert f r mich ein schlechter bericht,stonk gute idee dann kann die maschine ja einfach nach oben fliegen und dort kaffee verteilen d,blackkiwi89 eher bei der nasa sich melden,also bei mir ist der kaffee leider auch nicht cremig und meine maschine ist so laut al w rde ein raketenstart in meiner k che stattfinden ist da normal oder sollte ich mich bei nespresso melden,oh super danke f r die info da klingt bei dir um einiges besser du meinst da geh rt eigentlich nicht so mit dem wasser in der kuppel denn da hat sich bi heute nicht ge ndert immer mal wieder direkt wenn man die kapsel nach zubereitung rausnimmt au der kuppel gleiches gilt f r den schaum auf dem kaffee gt meinst du vielleicht ist die getestete ein montagsger t mit den aktionen ist da richtig klar wir wollten keine aktionen ber cksichtigen bei jeden preisvergleich zum jetztigen stand da diese tempor r sind die letzte aktion die du erw hntest karaffe 5 stangen kaffee oder 10 stangen kaffee galt ebenso f r die vertuo plus wa bedeuten w rde das diese dann f r 20 euro bek me ab 18 10 2020 gibt e bei saturn amp co dann 50euros direktabzug nur auf die next also ab voraussichtlich 89 zu haben dann sieht der vergleich wieder anders au liebe gr e,auch wenn der autor versucht seine kritik zu besch nigen bleibt der vorwurf bei diesem youtube nur negative punkte zu finden er verschweigt die klaren unterschiede zu der normalen nespresso expresso maschinen bzw zu dem vorg nger version der vetuo klarer vorteil mit einer vertuo maschine ein sehr guten expresso 40 ml und mit der gleichen maschine bi zu einem volumen von fast 500 ml eine kanne kaffee zuzubereiten und auch mit der vertuo einen milchkaffee mit einem sehr festen milchschaum zu machen vorteil die milch ist nur im becher und l uft nicht wie bei vielen kaffeemaschinen durch die maschine selbst eine thermokanne mit 500 ml l sst sich unter den auslauf stellen bei der neuen vertou hat man auch an der geschwindigkeit de rotor gearbeitet um einen noch besseren kaffee zu erzeugen gerade die w lan oder netzanbindung hat nun die m glichkeiten online an der maschinensteuerung verbesserungen ohne problem zu bertragen der autor kasimir m beanstandet da der kaffeeschaum zu schnell zusammen fallen w rde aber die meisten kaffeetrinker wollen beim schwarzen kaffee keinen schaum ich kann al nutzer der vertuo nur sehr positive berichten da gilt auch f r den vorg nger von der vertou next einfach in einen medium markt oder saturn gehen und sich die vertuo vorf hren lassen verkostung geht leider wegen corone zur zeit nicht bi 20 10 l uft eine verkaufsaktion in den m rkten mit der vertou next 145 euro incl eine 0 5 l glaskanne oder 10 stangen kaffee,auch dieser werbekommentar wird nichts helfen,hallo inwiefern besch nigen wir legen doch beide unsere standpunkte dar bzw begr nden sie und ich kann ihre sichtweise nun besser nachvollziehen geht doch nicht darum jemand anderes seine meinung aufzudr cken sondern eine diskussion zu starten sei e nun direkt mit den autoren den zuschauenden oder anderen beteiligenten insofern danke f r die beitr ge gr e,mann wa f r ein unsinn der autor sollte erst mal die bediehungsanleitung lesen ich meine 2 punkte von 10 f r den autor nicht berichtet wurde ber den vorteil der vertuo ob alt oder neu bei der next milchkaffee von feinsten mit einen milchschaum die keine andere maschine hat weiter wir auch die vertuo auch mit milchaufsch umer angeboten und ber w lan soll die maschinensoftware aktualisiert werden also erst richtig alles lesen bevor man einen produkt so schlecht macht,kasimir m also mit der vertuo next bracht man ja nicht unbedingt einen milchaufsch umer weil die vertuo ja den kaffee mit der milch aufsch umen kann wem da nicht ausreicht oder den kaffee auf den milchschaum laufen lassen will kann sich ja da super angebot vertuo mit milchaufsch umer bestellen super sache sau gut,mark keller wenn sie sich mit dem ger t richtig besch ftigen w rde wurden sie verstehen da der hersteller eine update m glichkeit vorgesehen hat gerade mit der neuen gro en kapsel wurde ja ein update durchgef hrt ber da update kann die schleuder geschwindigkeit und die temperatur optimiert werden sp etwas gibt e nur bei nespresso,da ding macht kaffee wa soll man da updaten mini game,hallo danke f r den kommentar milchschaum bzw den aeroccino habe ich hier ja nicht getestet die vertuo maschinen besitzen alle keinen eigen integrierten aufsch umer da ist korrekt bez glich der softwareupdates der maschine habe ich da im video nicht mehr erw hnt dann habe ich da herausgeschnitten ich kann ihnen amp den brigen lesern an dieser stelle sagen das nach r cksprache mit drei verschiedenen mitarbeitern de herstellers mittelfristig keine neuen funktionen geplant sind ber die connectivity f higkeit oder ber die update und da ist eine verschenkte chance darum geht e bei dem punkt dieser bewertung vielleicht ist da nicht deutlich genug von un gemacht worden das der mehrwert durch die app u m n nicht gegeben ist bei den maschinen mit den kleinen kapseln gibt e im vergleich z b bereits programmiertes br hen daher wirklich schade das diese chance anscheinend mittelfristig berhaupt nicht genutzt werden wird gr e,very nice video have you tried taste comparison between the next machine and vertuoplus some review suggest the coffee is slightly more bitter on the next,i have watched several video and it seems there are both version of the bitterness thing what i can say is that i have a next and so far i am completely satisfied with the flavor of the coffee,hi thanks for the information i have qatched some review before but for me i could not agree with more bitterness of the coffee prepared by the next in comparison to our plus at least,quod erat demonstrandum wie immer ein sehr informatives und tolles video von dir zuz glich w rde ich an der maschine noch kritisieren das die abtropfschale nur einen haltepunkt hat im gegensatz zur vertuo plus welche zwei hat,danke ja stimmt die bei der next ist auch aufgrund der schlanken bauweise etwas kleiner geschmackssache ihren zweck erf llt sie soweit so gut,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,a simple guide to vertuo cup size vertuo next the next is currently gbp77 88 on amazon,are you still happy with this machine,if it wa wifi try 2 4ghz not 5ghz or other way around,woman v tecnology not compatible,is the noise making normal,bruh clean your ipad,thanks for the video my husband bought this a an early christmas gift to ourselves dollar129 cad during cyber monday,can you use any different coffee pod with this machine,what is the app for,why do u need to bluetooth it thanks for the video ill start saving up for one are they hard to clean could u do a video on how to clean coffee machine,mine came with pod but they were expired,they no longer make or sell alto capsule,i know it is such a shame,well done thanks for your guidance,u have no idea your pad is filthy,hi great video and very informative can i add that i had the same drama when connecting my bluetooth and i am a tech by trade not wanting to be beaten research ensued and i solved the problem when i purchased the machine yesterday the kind assistant registered it for me in the shop that is where the problem start when the machine is registered to your account without the bluetooth being done first it stop it connecting because it assumes you have done it ha part of the bluetooth and wifi connecting process it also register the machine to your account and it can not complete this if it is already there solution log into your account on the web and in the my machine tab remove it then start the connection process again and it connects flawlessly and register it again hope this help,i just got the next and it will not connect i guess i will just have to walk all the way over to the machine and press the button the horror,really random but are you married to the a2b man who doe nespresso review your kitchen surface look very similar lol xxx,i am not x,what good is the wifi bluetooth connection,thank you so much for this it really helped get me started with using my nespresso vertuo next will watch your video on different cup size next,i find it very sad that you have to pair a device to make a coffee,you do not have to pair to make coffee just for update,that ipad need some cleaning,no valid information about the purpose of software update wifi bluetooth it ha not nothing to do with making a cup of coffee nespresso shame on you for not providing the consumer with the information that this technical feature serf a valid purpose,more pub please,damn thats loud,i have just acquired one vertuo next and i do not find it ad loud a they sound on these video i guess that somehow the audio is amplified by the microphone used by the youtubers,do you have to pair it to a device in order for it to work or is it an additional feature,you do not have to the pairing is only for future update to the machine that nespresso release to my knowledge they have not done an update yet,help doe anyone know where to get a reusable capsule for this one,amazon,thanks i wa wondering why i would want to connect my phone via bluetooth turn out there isnt a good reason,mine would not pair either but i guess i had selected the wrong machine,doe the coffee get hot enough i had a model from 2017 and it wa never hot,part 2 i just disposed of my nespresso virtuo machine it is a true piece of garbage i strongly suggest purchasing the original machine if you must have a nespresso machine the pod are overpriced and the machine only work after the you manipulate the spinner which is very difficult to do even doing that there is no guarantee that the machine will work moreover if you want a hot cup of coffee you will have to wait lace your cup into the microwave after the coffee ha been poured because this machine only produce warm coffee,received it a a gift and it worked fine the first few time unfortunately i invested in purchasing the uber expensive capsule just in time for the machine to stop working when i researched the instruction manual for help i found the manual to of very little help in short i have not thrown the machine out yet because it wa a gift but i joyfully had a delicious cup of coffee from my very ordinary keurig machine instead unless you have plenty of disposable income for an expensive machine and extremely expensive capsule do not buy,i have a vertuo plus now had it for 3yrs it is leaking about the head gasket area for the 2nd time they have agreed to repair it for free but i thought i would consider buying a new next machine what exactly is the purpose of the bluetooth connection after getting it paired what doe the connection do,the only purpose of the bluetooth connection is so nespresso can send software update when required i do not even think nespresso have sent any update yet,bought the same machine but never got the promotion of the free coffee please help thanks,is there coffee granule at the bottom of your coffee my coffee end up with quite a bit of it i have the essenza mini and i never had that problem,i do not experience that issue it may be worth contacting nespresso so they can fix this for you,i love my nespresso,oh em gee mine come in in 4 day that cup of morning heaven look amazing i do not think i am going to hook my machine to my network though great video miss,planning with crystal why i did not get one of these earlier it is so delightful have you tried reusing the old pod with those silicone top or foil i am looking into that have a safe and wonderful new year miss,thank you enjoy it when it arrives,i had trouble pairing too so thanks for making this video and assuring me that i am not the only one,what is the app for though,i am so glad mine work without pairing,hi thank you for the video i have both traditional and vertuo machine somebody gave me a lot of vertuo cup now but i prefer espresso coffee can i drink vertuo long coffee 230ml a espresso coffee 80ml or is too strong and not good i tried the stormio one to drink it with 80ml and seems to be good,look cheap a hell i will keep my better looking virtual plus thanks,when i got my next i thought it looked cheaper than others too,way too long of a video cut the talk and it would be fine,i figured out that the pairing work only if the phone and the machine is on the same wifi network the machine will only connect on 2 4ghz wifi so the phone or tablet must be connected to 2 4ghz wifi do this only for the pairing after that you can set your phone or tablet back to 5ghz,fabulous thank you this explains it a my wifi ha the 2 setting 2 4 5ghz,my first nespresso i did not know about pairing do not want that so should i exchange for a simpler version,you do not have to pair it that is just an option for future update,do you have to connect to wifi can not i just start using it if i had known i would not have gotten it,planning with crystal thanks for the speedy reply i figured it out thanks so much blessed holiday,you do not have to connect to wifi you can just start making drink the wifi connection is just for software update to the machine there ha not been any so far a far a i am aware,hello why do you need to pair up the machine to the iphone is it something you do everytime you have a cuppa coffee it kinda annoying,you only need to connect to the wifi once and it is just so nespresso can send automatic software update to the machine,with mine my motor run for 5 second and then blink orange twice and shuts off,jeannette garcia i took mine back too and went back to keurig no more problem,the one i bought did the same thing i ended up returning it could not get it to work,glad i came across this video i bought one during their black friday sale and never saw anything about connect to wifi or bluetooth so this is cool,hi i am new to coffee machine just received this same product in white can i just ask a few question please 1 depending on what capsule you go for do you need different cup size 2 what is the purpose of connecting to your phone 3 i like a smooth milk coffee i am more of a latte flat white what would you recommend pod for that thank you xx,keep clean your ipad,do not we have to run it with just water for the first time to wash it what kind of update can we expect for coffe machine,yes you have to do a cleaning run kinda nasty to skip that tbh,i honestly do not know what the update would even contain the only thing i can think of is that there is a barcode on the coffee pod and maybe if they plan on introducing more size or pod it might add that the barcode tell it what size the cup is supposed to be and then the software would update that,what is the color of your machine light or dark grey,i would say it a light grey,for the love of god please clean your ipad screen lol,i got a question when you open the machine do u see some water by where you put the capsule inside idk if that is normal but for me keurig machine there ha never been some water inside where you the capsule in,i just got mine and water is collected i am going to return it so disappointed,so what can i do with the app only check firmware,seems way noisier than vertuoplus,that is because it is,just ordered mine off the nespresso website p it is ok special offer for gbp79 with 50 complimentary capsule so i am saving this video for when mine come,fabulous enjoy,crystal what is the purpose of the bluetooth,it is so you can do software update to the machine when needed,great review can one capsule give you a latte,yes the smaller 1 35 oz and 2 75 oz size are espresso bean you can use for your latte making just heat up milk in another mug and use a handheld frother or a cup frother that come with other nespresso model or can be purchased separately,get an espresso machine that ha a built in milk frother not this one milk is the main ingredient in latte necessary milk and espresso optional flavor syrup like vanilla mocha etc,omg so pleased i wasnt the only one on the phone to nespresso for age trying to connect with wifi and bluetooth tried about 96 time then finally connected and same screen a yours no update nespresso lady wa very very patient with me thumb up to them and amazing amzing coffee now can not work out what the bluetooth name for the machine is,do you get a complimentary pair of ear plug with every cup,planning with crystal i love my nespresso but man they make it inconvenient to get ahold of anybody at a store,paul thomas nespresso is so thoughtful,actually that is the initial wake up alarm free option before the brewing is done,,pairing worked for me when i unlocked it and opened it it took awhile for me too,i had the exact opposite problem my bluetooth connected right away although when i tried to connect the wifi it would not work it show a full signal a well a a correct network and password we are used just will not work for some reason,just got one and i have the same problem,same for me today how would you get it to work,can anyone explain the difference between the vertuo next coffee machine and vertuo next coffee maker please i have seen both of these on john lewis website price is the same but can not tell the difference are the pod only available to purchase from nespresso store or can you buy them from the supermarket third party love the mug doe this come with the machine,the difference between the two machine on the john lewis site is that one is made my krups and the other by magimix the pod can only be purchased online on the nespresso website or in one of their boutique some john lewis store also sell them there are no 3rd party capsule a each one is individually barcoded so i do not think they can be copied replicated the cup i had to purchase seperately from nespresso i love them these are the one i use they are currently out of stock online but hopefully they will come back in stock soon,i did not get the pod sample kit with mine either went to live chat to tell them and wa told 3 5 day delivery so am sat with a brand new machine i can not use not a good first experience with nepsresso will say though that the machine and my android phone connected very easily i wa dreading trying a i have seen so many review saying that connecting wa a nightmare also heard a lot of people say they prefer their older vertuo plus machine lot say these next is are making bubblier le velvety froth crema how are you finding the crema,hi there doe it have both hot and cold milk frothing option,no this machine doe not froth milk at all you would need to purchase a separate milk frother for that,like yourself i can not connect my iphone 8 to the brute had to use an android tablet and i did not receive the sampler kit of pod i think nespresso have taken a step back with this machine compared to my old vertuo plus cracking video keep up the good work bless you,thank you david so frustrating re the connectivity and lack of capsule,le talking and get to the point got a headache after this video too much unnecessary talk,it is an unboxing vid not a demo of course she gon na talk duhh,rude go watch another video then or do your own jeez,could not agree more very poor review got really bored,what doe nice temperature mean is it hot,planning with crystal i agree with chris more of an explanation of nice temperature would have been better one of my biggest complaint with nespresso is that the coffee is not hot enough we just bought this machine tonight and the sale lady said the machine will do different temp based on what the bar code is on the pod i am not sure i totally believe that,yes it is hot just not boiling,do you know if you can make just hot water in the machine to make a cup of tea,no i am afraid not and a the water is not boiling it would not make a very nice cup of tea anyway,thank you for this video i am new to nespresso and this model will be my next purchase i just purchased the vertuo evoluo and i can not wait for it to come,thanks i hope you enjoy your new machine when it arrives,hello with the bluetooth connectivity can we programm a coffee or it is just to check the update of the machine,planning with crystal lol and the update are presumably just for the connectivity the bluetooth etc but seriously it is a shame you can not do thing like enter descaling mode,the connectivity is just for update i am afraid,omg i can not connect machine ha,is not it frustrating,nice video thank u can i ask what is the purpose of the connectivity to bluetooth,planning with crystal thank u,thanks the bluetooth connectivity is so the machine can be updated,got the machine today but the bluetooth thing stress me out so bad,it is so frustrating,whose bright idea is it to put the tank on the back,for me i like the tank at the back design but i also fill the tank with a bottle and did not remove it so for handling it is a bad choice but for design a good choice in my opinion,it doe make a challenge at time,just got mine this morning mine too is missing the sample box of coffee,planning with crystal hi i have a question i actually just received the same exact machine plug it in turn it on and make coffee once i dispense the old pad i close it and return the machine to the lock position after a min it shut off there is no other off bottom right,same here no sample been told 3 5 day delivery really frustrating,how frustrating definitely contact them and i am sure they will send a box out right away hope you enjoy your new machine,i am so glad you did this video on the vertuo next i have got the machine in red love the vertuo next and it is slim profile work great in my small kitchen i have also got the original line lattissima plus at home and the u model at work your experience in making the bluetooth and wifi connection wa exactly the same for me and many others based on review of this machine the machine first said my device wa already connected to another nespresso then i wa told no machine wa found nearby i did a reset of the machine and my router modem that did the trick i use an iphone x max to make the connection the app is clearly buggy and hopefully an update will sort this out also my machine almost always reconnects to bluetooth when i plug it back in the next time the wifi however will not reconnect unless i restart my router modem and sometimes i may also have to reset the machine again thanks so much for the helpful video,thank you edward i had to restart my wifi too it wa such a pain to set up i hope you are enjoying your machine,that next machine is really loud my plus machine is way quieter,zulma grau thanks for the information,i think it is the microphone proximity to the machine because i have it and is really quiet doe not make this annoying sound,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
