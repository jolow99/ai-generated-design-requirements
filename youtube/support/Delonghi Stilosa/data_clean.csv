0,DeLonghi Stilosa EC260 Espresso Machine | Crew Review,coffee grinder info great video but i wish you had shown the cleaning process i am lazy when it come to cleaning that is why i do not have a juicer they are a nightmare to clean this machine is very sweet working i just bought a brand new one from a reseller super satisfied with the espresso i make with it for it is price a little noisy but worth it thank you for this video wondering what i am doing wrong my shot drip into my cup instead of having a nice stream a yours did i am brand new to the espresso machine can you help me out still delonghi is a dishonest company with stupid engineer doing bad designes and lye 15 bar lol not even close can you use pod with this machine mine ha the ese label on it and i do not know how to use pod or if i can i have one but idk if i am using the right ground coffee i am confused a to how to use the extra coffe holder how doe that fit into the portafiller so doe it come with a tamper are the maintenance and cleaning required similar to performing a surgical procedure like nepresso doe it come w the grinder already hi there what wa that coffee grinder called cheer i have a similar machine and i am just confused at when to stop pulling the shot i thought the machine would stop on it own after the shot is done but it keep going so i really do not know when to stop it could someone help me on that im also very new to espresso but i recommend getting a 1 ounce espresso cup and once it is full you turn it off one ounce is one shot of espresso so if you want 2 shot use 2 one ounce cup then after brewing your shot you can pour them into your big cup hope this help haha i bought a similar machine i love it so much and decided to start a youtube channel making very nice drink with it you did a great review my video are coming soon we warm our milk to 140 degree and end up with half foam half milk she mention removing a metal piece on the want but we do not see how any suggestion we are wasting a lot of milk other than that love the machine you probably already figured this out by now but the metal tube on the wand twist off this video is very helpful my machine is weird i used to be a barista and could make pretty decent coffee and froth milk and get microfoam with this one nah when the machine say the frothing setting is on it will work for about 12seconds and then get weak and stop the green light will come off a if the water got cold then i have to wait till it come on again it is always interrupted never just one time i am having the same issue one strategy i found helpful is to let it prime a little longer after the green light come on like 3 5 extra minute hope this help out of 14 gram of coffee how many gram of brew about 43 gram when i am doing my espresso it is always water coming out from the evaporator why any help please u have to rinse them out a u can see in this video this machine only work with ground coffee i use my grinder and the machine make a lot of noise and do not brew and spit the water from the frot not from the portafilter is a mess can someone help me pls is this the same a stilosa 235 bk i would like to comment that on this machine you have to stop the dial when making your shot i time mine to about 30 second for the double shot and i like it that way good luck update for a double shot i usually stop it around the 17 second mark it depends on the espresso and the grind but i find that with some brand more than 20 second end up tasting pretty watery thank you this is why i came here this is exactly what i wa wondering so then should i fill the water well all the way or should i also try to measure guess how much water to use for one serving this is my only complaint with this machine i do not want to guess when my brew is finished okay thanks i wa thinking the machine wa going to stop on it own and it never dead lol so i appreciate that i wa wondering how much a shot would be just bought this machine and have had really terrible shot the espresso come out unbelievably watery i have fiddled with the grind tamp pressure etc but still no luck doe anyone have any suggestion really want to give this a chance before returning it ana mcdonald how many ml do you end up with at 30seconds i got like 105 and i stopped at 25seconds taste watered down i time my shot right from the first drop i start the timer and leave it for 30 second then stop the machine it a little annoying to have to time them every time but worth it since this machine doe not stop on it own so is the bigger filter for a double shot amp the smaller filter a single shot trying to figure it out yes that is correct doe the green ready light go off and on while you are frothing mine doe also i like to steam my milk to 160 degree so there are time when the steam stop altogether or slows to a slightly audible hiss i have to turn off the steam wait a few second then steam again but in doing this i get water mixed with steam for a few second afterward sometimes the steam quits mid frothing sometimes not i have experimented using a glass bowl to watch how the steam peforms and it is inconsistent at best any input here also there is a tiny indentation in the silver frothing sleeve about 1 4 inch from the top collar is this an air intake if so why is it sealed doe it come with the pitcher no i like the delonghi also i am very interested in the grinder can anyone tell me the make and the model of the grinder thanks so much in advance my email is chungchencho icloud com how do you know when to stop time it i start my stopwatch on the first drop i see i leave for 30 second then stop the dial thats for a double shot how to change the basket when i first bought it the basket wa already in the portafilter and i can not get it out hi i use a wooden spoon fork thing there should be a little gap near the handle where you can insert something under the basket lip to apply leverage to the basket i love how your video are naturally presented with these beautiful little mistake tx scg kannon keanu scammer kannon keanu instablaster i know im asking the wrong place but doe any of you know of a way to get back into an instagram account i wa stupid forgot my account password i appreciate any tip you can give me hi im having problem with my shot it doe not have any crema or bubbling this machine is full of rubber hose and soft plastic it water temperature is too high and overextracts coffee if you knew what you are taliking about you would have 1 run water through the machine several time before 2 tasted the espresso without the milk 3 shown the water tank is made out of white soft plastic with bpas and 4 would have noticed the basket filter is 50percent rubber which would have hopepully doubtedly alarmed you you would know there is no such thing a a cheap and decent espresso machine because a decent espresso machine offer at least some control over the water temperature and doe not have a soft plastic water tank you would know any brand new decent espresso machine cost a lot because it would include rock solid material and technology of temperature and pressure control espresso drinking is a science and an art espresso coffee is tested first without milk actually it is not tested with milk first but you are just a sale person who display a total lack of knowledge of the espresso industry it take at least more than dollar1 000 to buy a decent machine without rubbery and plasticky material soft plastic and rubber cause cancer this machine in particular smell like rubber and leak rubbery smell all over not only because it interior is made of rubber hose and soft plastic it basket filter is made of rubber but also because it pump produce excessive pressure and heat it water at too high boiling temperature but of course you would not care to even notice that it portafilter and filter are 50percent rubber because you belong to the fast coffee culture who think expresso mean fast boiled latte and cappuccino mean steam wand this machine is for the most ignorant population and it saddens me that delonghi make such dirt i fell in this trap a a prey consumer of this cheap and rubbery machinery until i learned what it take to produce balanced and finely tuned coffee drink if you like your expressos taste like rubbery coffee go ahead and keep drinking out of unpacked rubbery machine and keep believing you can buy a brand new decent and solid espresso machine with it interior made of healthy copper and steel for le than dollar1 000 keep enjoying your commercial coffee drink might a well be all you know a far a espresso culture go bro go touch some grass lmao how doe it compare to the dedica from the spec it look really similar for a lower price these machine are truly bad plastic interior and fake basket filter it is sooo sad nah you did not taste the espresso in it pure state you do not know much about this abueloraton this machine is just a simple device for prosumer use for those who want a reasonably priced espresso machine for their counter top it is not meant for professional use in a cafe or restaurant and most people are not wealthy enough to afford a dollar1 000 gigantic machine in their kitchen get a grip on what this product is designed for it is not for coffee snob i know enough to beat the quality of a number of coffee shop i have been to i know enough to enjoy some very nice cup of espresso and i certainly know enough to save a heck of a lot of money in the process for thing more important and long reaching than drinking espresso needing hundred or even thousand of dollar worth of equipment to have a 10 minute drink anyone have leaking from bottom of the machine issue this is not a leak it is some kind of overflow protection these machine are the successor of the former kenwood kmix espresso machine and they also do have this hole on the underside hello how much time should the coffe extraction be or how many ml should the coffe be when it ready for both single and double shot abueloraton cmon you do not have to write 100 of comment about how bad this machine is reading youtube comment to understand how many people like the machine and most of the time i read a negative review it you which is annoying jianli pan i do 30 second for a double lol everyone got ta find their grove with this machine since it doe not automatically stop this machine is so bad it will not produce a balanced extraction no matter what i am wondering the same thing doe the water flow stop automatically you had to turn the dial to stop from the little experience i have with the machine you have to stop the machine after you pull your shot i ended up with a weird americano after my first use lol just ordered one of these for dollar99 off best buy can not wait to try it ha to be an upgrade from my old steam powered goodwill find lol but i understand everyone is frustration you should not need to mod the hell out your machine to get great coffee when you can just buy a breville lol i got mine for dollar25 dollar at a salvage store intact and it really good to use a an introduction into espresso my cup come up great i use lavazza coffee once i feel comfortable enough i think i will up grade to a breville good luck efren ramirez chavez yes it wa dramatically worse redfishcarolina damn fr even compared to your steam powered machine efren ramirez chavez it wa wretched i returned it i blew dollar30 in bean trying to get one decent cup from it but everything wa bitter sour or weak this machine is an outrageous waste of money is a nice machine but even with the double shot i still need a little more punch on my coffee which make a little inconvenient because it will take me longer to make the coffee the way i like it other than that is very user friendly i just need my coffee stronger are nespresso pod compatible in this model or can you open a nespresso pod and dump the content in for the same effect opening the pod or even opening kcups work great which is bettef ec260 or ec235 or ec221 thank u but where the frick is gail look cheap and ugly wtf your espresso will taste like crap after 8 sec if you do not immediately mix it with steamed milk fyi always have your milk steamed and ready to go ghislaincarrier i am a barista and usually the shot of espresso would die in like 15 second if we do not put the milk in there quick enough i hope your realize you said something stupid if i order an espresso at a coffee shop i have 8 second between the time the shot is done and i am done drinking it i hope the barista doe not waste 6 of those 8 second before giving me my cup old myth can not get micro foam no matter what i try i have watched countless video and milk is either too thin or too foamy i have been practicing with frothing soap and water and a cup of water with cocoa powder in it to simulate espresso got tired of wasting my milk but on the plus side the espresso that come out of this machine are very tasty i have had the machine about two week or so and i like it so far gina steimle hi not sure how i would even post picture on a reply but i watch a lot of the people that do latte art either here on youtube or tiktok lot of really good people out there author erica r stinson could you post picture of your latte art i work on mine occasionally and it is just atrocious i need some inspiration thanks author erica r stinson glad to know congrats paulina thanks for writing i have practiced all this past year and now i get microfoam and have been doing latte art fairly decently for a few month now the machine is still working great the latte are good and i am very happy with it all author erica r stinson hey we have replaced our coffee machine it wa new and now it is working perfectly it is actually quite easy to make froth there is no special trick also the milk get hot very quickly before it took like 3 minute to warm up but now it take 20 second so just wanted to let you know this maybe your coffee machine is also defective what kind of grinder is that zach sheffee i know that is she not grinding the coffee bean with a grinder at 4 00 zach sheffee she is not using a grinder to grind the coffee also do you have to change out the coffee every time you brew an espresso and use new coffee every time i am a newbie yes fresh coffee each time the coffee filter came in a bunch of piece doe anyone have a video on how to put it together abueloraton is there any that use glass and the water tank is soft plastic which cause cancer bpas in soft plastic 50percent of the filter made out of rubber and the portafilter ha plastic i just got this and it a pretty nice upgrade from using my aeropress the instruction were not clear about this when you first put water in it to flush the machine out it gon na take a few min before the pump prime and water come out first thing you do after adding water is switch to the brew water setting not the heat up setting then you wait a couple min before the water even come out abueloraton you talk about knowing high quality espresso yet bought a dollar100 piece of junk machine and you should have known what your in store for avolate fpv no it is not consistent you will have problem with it not opening up just wait a few month this is ine of the lowest end machine ever abueloraton ive used high end machine before but they were at restaurant and i do not have the counterspace for a large machine at home sure the portafilter ha some rubber in it but so doe the aeropress the portafilter in this machine ha a spring loaded check valve that only open when it at the right pressure i seems to work pretty good avolate fpv you might not really know high quality espresso this cheap machine overextracts and overpressurizes make coffee much bitter and acid than it is supposed to taste besides it filter and portafilter are 50percent made out of rubber which is absolutely unacceptable and unhealthy avolate fpv it interior are made out of rubber the brew filter check it out is half rubber compressed filter fake pressure it tank is made out of soft plastic which ha bpas it hose are all made out of rubber it overheats the water which cause extra bitterness in the coffee it pump is waaaay too powerful cause coffee brew flow to exceed the standard brew flow rate for espresso which cause poor extraction acidity and it smell and taste like rubber the aeropress is a machine with huge acceptance and following by coffee expert now aeropress is not an espresso brewer if you want espresso aeropress is the wrong tool this delonghi machine make overextracted fake espresso for people who do not really know what espresso really is i am having to return this piece of junk and i have had to switch to french press for the time being at least the french press is not made out of cheap plastic and rubber hose if i ever have an espresso it better be finely tuned that is the whole point of espresso and just so that you know compressurized filter do not generate a full extraction also for your info basket filter should be percent metal not half metal half rubber like the trash you are drinking your commercial supermarket burnt coffee out of how doe this compare to the 230 and the 235 samhondros can you get th 230 in the u it seems to be the only difference is the non pannarello steam wand on the 230 which i see a a plus what kind of coffee grind were you using here how do i make a caramel latte i did not see the step where you added either milk or water to the machine but i did see milk and water come out do you put the milk and the water in at the same time in 2 separate reservoir wtf is wtrh doing rubber hose and soft plastic tank disgusting i had to return it the next day decent espresso machine are sadly expensive because they require solid built alex simone oh good info thanks very much i purchased this exact machine online delivering to me this sunday hi the milk and water do not come out of the machine the espresso just look creamy to make a caramel latte you add caramel syrup to your cup add espresso and then add milk in this video she made a latte without flavor hope that help how long should i hold for the broth i like creme but i am having a hard time with broth milk hold the cup that you are steaming in and slowly pull the container downward until the tip of the frother is just below the surface of the milk this will give it the best froth here is a list that helped me out whinyl com espresso guide in the end i went with 1 4 01 specifically what is it about this machine that make it definitely not latte art worthy i have the machine and not been able to obtain the proper milk consistency for latte art so why doe it have this shortcoming the reason why is because the steamer wa made to make the milk really frothy like in a cappuccino thicker foam is very difficult to create latte art because it is stiff what i managed to figure out is to just steam it like normal with around 8 oz of milk then when done take some of the foam out with a spoon then swirl the pitcher to combine the frothed milk perfect latte art steamed milk should be glossy and look like paint i have a very similar machine ecp 3420 and my understanding is that the steam that come from the wand is not strong enough to spin the milk which is a requirement for making microfoam anyone else is coffee from this machine really weak i have bought really nice bean and it not doing it for me any advice jack brennan i would say if you are grinding your own bean crank your grinder to the finest grind setting you can i have a little mr coffee that ha a pretty fine grind setting on it also i do not believe the machine ha an auto stop for pulling shot are you using to double shot filter or the single shot filter thiccynickyy hey thanks for the great reply i have bought both pre ground bean and whole bean myself and noticed very little difference the water pressure seems okay too so i am really not too sure i have nice bean at the moment but still the coffee is not a strong a it would be from a cafe obviously you can get better machine than this one but i still expected nicer coffee there are either 2 problem why this is occurring the grind of the coffee is not fine enough or the machine doe not use enough pressure to expel the coffee i am not sure if you grind your own bean but you have to make sure whether you do it yourself or have a barista do it for you that it is a fine grind it should be like fine sand if it is not fine enough then it will come out watery and sour and also i forgot to mention but another thing could be that the coffee bean you are using are too much of a light roast lighter roast are usually not a strong a darker one and are used for drip coffee or french press so if you are using a lighter roast i would suggest trying a darker one and finally the machine may have a pressure problem because if you notice it drip slower when brewing then the machine probably doe not expel enough pressure to be consistent i would try troubleshooting it from their customer service or maybe get a replacement if your machine is noticeably broken sorry if this is too long i am just a barista bored at 11pm i have had this machine for a few month now and recently have had issue dispensing espresso after consulting the manual i bought the delonghi descaling solution i followed instruction to the letter and even did an extra cycle of clean water to ensure i wa not going to be brewing the solution into my espresso ala i still can not get my espresso i normally always use the double shot basket i have disassembled and cleaned thoroughly by had and nothing i do not over fill or under fill the basket with ground i tamp it lightly not to light or too firm i still have had no success ha anyone had an issue similar or perhaps any suggestion fill with 4 cup vinegar and run machine till empty do not rely on delonghi customer service they seem to purposely drag out your case so you run out of warranty replacement take a long time to accomplish try a coarse grind because it is already a pressurized portafilter can you use any bean or ground espresso if you use like a starbucks ground coffee in it is that technically espresso espresso is style of coffee but yes there are also espresso bean which are roasted a bit longer than coffee bean when i first had mine 3420 almost the identical machine functionally i tried starbucks bean and asked them to grind it espresso it wa fine like talcum powder and simply would not drip because it became thick sludge in the basket when it got all wet there simply wa not enough pressure to get through the sludge from that extremely fine powdery grind i bought a bodum bistro grinder for dollar70 on sale keep it at the finest setting grind 14 gram using my dollar12 scale tamp it very firmly and there you go make a decent 1 1 2 oz shot in 20 second or so if you do not have a grinder explain to starbucks that you have a pressure basket machine and need the grind to be about like granulated sugar in texture that should get you there you need coffee with an espresso grind it is a good deal finer than you would get from a preground bag you could go to starbucks or a shop that sell bean and have them grind it for an espresso we always recommend grinding what you are going to use right away and keeping the rest whole bean for freshness but if you do not have a grinder it is just fine i do not get how to pull the double shot using the second filter provided the instruction manual doe not provide a good explanation nor illustration and the woman in the video did not provide an explanation either this is frustrating the double shot doe not mean pulling a typical 18 19 gram double shot delonghi call 7 gram a single shot 14 a double shot they should call their double shot a single and a half shot just tamp 14 gram in there real firmly and if your grind is about the fineness of granulated sugar you can manage a nice little 1 1 2 oz to maximum 2 oz espresso partly depends on the bean a to whether you want to keep your shot 1 1 2 or stretch it to 2 it look bigger so two shot is this similar to an ecp 35 31 and would you recommend replacing the pressurised arm thingy with a non pressurised thiccynickyy ok thanks author erica r stinson that is right the more fat in a milk the more foam it will be able to take 2percent will be a little better not much i would try non fat since it is really hard to create foam even if it is a different milk fat content the machine attachment is still going to produce that higher foam level most likely thiccynickyy one thing i may try is 2percent milk a i have been using whole i usually take half and half in my coffee so the more fat in my milk the smoother the coffee will taste but if i am not mistaken the instruction manual state to use 2percent milk i think i saw another answer on here about whole milk having too much fat in it that creates a lot of foam i am willing to try it and see author erica r stinson yeah do not feel bad it is the machine fault you can take the attachment silver part off and steam it with the nozzle which can be more manual to steam milk but even a a barista myself it is pretty hard to get it perfect thiccynickyy i have been using a spoon to take the excess foam off the top when i go to far so this is a really solid piece of advice what is killing me is i think i am really close but i am still missing the mark somewhere got one of these for christmas these type of machine are not really for coffee drinker these are for people who just want stuff pain in the as to get a good cup of coffee save yourself some time money counter space mess and just get a moka pot lauryn hatten hi how did yours go im having the same trouble mary ligon thank you so much for your help lauryn hatten hi lauren i grind mine about the texture of granulated sugar the finest setting on my bodum bistro plus grinder then i tamp it very firmly and run the machine till the top of the crema hit 1 5 2 oz maximum that take around 21 24 second and can vary just slightly with the type of bean and how it is roasted it seems in my experience since the grind is not a fine a might be ideal it is important to really tamp it very firmly it is when i learned to do that my coffee started being really good because the very firm tamping had slowed the extraction down you will read people advising 26 30 second from first drip but this would be for more coffee than a paltry little 14 gr basket try 1 5 oz espresso max 2 and in between i think you might find an improvement good luck with it mary ligon hi thank you how long do you brew it for i am still getting sour shot but i do not want to give up on it just yet lauryn hatten hi lauren i use 14g for the double shot tamp it real firmly and it work great enjoy your ne a machine and some real good coffee anyone else think that is a horrible looking cup of coffee not necessarily the machine is fault i am guessing tony gibbon i wa aware of that when i first got it too but even without the outer part the steam pressure is horrible so it doe not create consistent foam thiccynickyy if you take the outer cover of the steam wand off you can get creamy micro foam milk the weird thing about this machine is that the steamer can only basically steam milk to create thicker froth for like cappuccino so it just look weird and milky probably because of that it is not a cup of coffee it is a latte hi thanks for the video wa exactly i wa looking for also i am gon na start buying my coffee supply at your bellevue store hey how is this different from the dollar150 ecp3420 other than more plastic on stilosa amp more stainless steel on the ecp3420 is there any functional difference also i find it interesting that the more expensive ecp3420 ecp3620 ecp3630 come with 3 filter basket one shot double shot amp ese yet the stilosa only come with two basket with the single basket used for the pod can someone explain that i have the 3420 it basically seems identical just with more stainless trim the basket are 7 gram 14 gram and the other one is for the ese pod never tried the ese pod a i like to use freshly ground coffee rather than old ground coffee wrapped in filter paper this lady make me nervous wa she drunk what am i doing wrong that my machine is so loud check the water container if it is not in right it make it louder andrew savoy i think so too i have not found any solution lol manos fragkiadakis unfortunately not haha i think it just loud lol everyones is loud innthe comment right now my coffee machine is so loud to maybe you found a solution what type of milk shouls i use and also what type of grounded coffee should i buy thank you if you buy your coffee bean from a starbucks peet is or any coffee shop they can grind the bean to an espresso grind fine grind for you if you buy bean from the store however you are going to need a grinder to grind them you can use any type of milk but if you want creamy and foamy milk you need a milk with fat which the best is whole milk non fat you can use but it will be incredibly hard to froth since there is not any fat to froth nicely you have to grind the coffee yourself the grinder is actually much more important than the machine and you should invest more in a good grinder is this better than nespresso original line i think so for my taste the nespresso make a tasty cup but any time one us the pod the coffee ha been ground for a long time and sitting in paper which further absorbs aroma from the ground bean i prefer grinding my own bean and using them immediately i have only had nespresso coffee a few time and do not know if they can use freshly ground coffee or if they only use the pod my e260 is not giving me the green ready light anymore you know why thx is the portafilter stainless steel no half plastic the filter is half rubber this machine is rubbish returned it the very same day nauseating aluminum alloy i would love to know what you think about how this machine compare to the ec155m that your channel reviewed a while back i like the ec155m better prefer the steamer on left side mine just broke after 5 year noticed hardly any creama on video shot what grinder have you featured in this video and what is a good espresso bean grinder for this espresso machine i really like my bodum bistro with my delonghi ecp3420 very similar to this machine being reviewed the bodum go on sale direct from the company fairly regularly mine wa dollar70 scg sell it a well at the lowest setting the grind just work great with this machine just tamp it firmly and hope it all work out for you this is a pressurized machine so most grinder that can grind a bit fine and preground coffee will work it will make you fine espresso if you want some good espresso you could always buy a normal depressurized portafilter and a good grinder though if you want to get into good espresso i would save the money and get a good machine and a good grinder you can find pretty nice second hand deal on a gaggia classic a a machine and a compak grinder or something like that that will be a setup that make damn good coffee i assure you hi thanks for the video i just bought the stilosa and i do not know what i am doing my shot come out watery i want to make cuban coffee and i am just learning about the pressurized basket amp how i have to eyeball the shot can i use something like pre ground bustelo supreme or pilon on this machine please h e l p m e also the delonghi ecp3420 is just dollar22 more did i make the right choice maribeth russell hi maribeth and congrats hope you really enjoy your new machine mary ligon thank you for your comment just bought one and your tip are so helpful tony gibbon hi tony thanks for your thanks no problem with the delay my machine is still going great just like new and am still using it and the steamer daily i have indeed cut my caffeine consumption down a bit but if i need a better jolt and a bigger cup for an early morning with not enough sleep i use 22 gram of dark grind in a pourover i have a big mug that hold 250 gram of poured coffee 100 gram of steamed milk for a total of 350 gram weight of liquid perfect for me and an espresso in the afternoon if i can work it in decaf french roast bean also perfect for me hope you are well and that covid impact is lessening in your world all the best mary ligon hi mary i just wanted to say thanks so much for that thoughtful and helpful reply not sure if i did not see it or i forgot to reply with it being christmas and covid season but i just revisited this video and saw it thank you hope you are still enjoying your machine and maybe your body ha adjusted to the lower dose of caffeine adding that i used the double shot filter with 2 scoop of espresso grind for the 1 1 2 to 2 oz shot what grinder is that capresso infinity hi what will be the best espresso machine for home that will vive una good shot we only make 4 cup daily of coffee kind of depends on what is really important to you in your coffee drinking and what your budget is there are so many option and machine it is impossible to say broadly what is best for you what are the most important feature and result for you and how much do you want to spend good question to start with good luck utter drivel 14grm double sum it up how can any serious coffee shop sell this pap philip davidson what planet do you live on 7g single and 14g double is standard where espresso wa born philip davidson seriously dollar2k for a setup to make a home espresso seriously man i have been using a damned goodwill find steam machine with cheap lavassa bean and a dollar20 blade grinder in other word the most cringe tastic espresso by most standard and while it is definitely just really strong coffee i struggle greatly at tasting much difference between it and what i get at local coffee shop with professional equipment yes different but still pretty good t god just research double boiler machine look at the state of her steaming wand double shot industrial standard 18 gt 20 grm you will be shocked at prosumer price and she admits a much ie it is not up to the job save up buy once the grinder is more important than the machine coffeegeek com is a good start but budget for about 2k for the pair educate me please i want to understand what you are talking about thanks for the video what grind setting do you use on the capresso mary ligon hi mary do you use the smaller version of the bodum bistro grinder or the larger one with the coffee bean is container on top i want to order mine and would like to order the one you mention it is just fir my personal use at home thank you i would suggest the finest since the capresso doe not grind powder fine i use my bodum bistro on it finest setting and tamp very firmly give a pretty good shot and a dry puck espresso is a very fine grind on most commercial grade grinder it is either a 1 or 2 yes what grind setting did she use she should have shown u doe it make a lot of noise when brewing using the machine there is a special place in hell for those who make these little low power espresso machine have you tried using this particular model which wa recently improved i have a 155 i bought for 25 buck on craigslist run a la pavoni unpressurized basket in it and get great result is it a rocket probably not doe it make shot better than 40percent of the shot i have bought out in the world yup now i do agree that making thing not to last is frustrating but i am also happy to be able to get into the hobby without dropping a grand or a special place in heaven for those who make something of espresso affordable to u humble mass is a scam unless you get one and return it before the grace period personally find the cheap breville machine are superior to the delonghi one mrmarki134 you nailed the exact issue with rancilios they are dumb tank they are heavy duty but to a fault just like every industry technology improves most people expect their machine to last 3 5 year and then they will upgrade even with the heavy duty material ranchilios inners are subject to same set of issue of calcium build up rubber seal aging etc even with proper maintenance many component do not out last other machine by a meaningful and useful way i think your argument about build quality is mostly centered around the concept of using metal versus plastic in that regard plastic technology improves and you can see breville is good at adapting those new technology to improve durability and touch feel of their product in that regard phillips also do a good job at it are breville perfect is every sense no but they are pretty darn close a you spend more time making coffee and get to know all the little nuance about the process i think you will appreciate breville more most of u have gone through the same process path w that is quite a good reasoning i completely agree with your point on delonghi and gaggia it kind of pain me to see that a once great company that made awesome machine now make cheap pressurized machine superautomatics and one good machine that is kinda pricy rancilio is machine i like more bc i think i would prefer le feature and more solid build i do not have a machine and i am sure i would love an infuser but i have heard that while they are very convenient they are not tank made to last year and year but who know i am kind of a noob and breville is also a bit young a a company maybe some machine will last a lifetime mrmarki134 i disagree rancilio make trim down commercial like machine for home use they are basically feature and convenience stripped their only claim to fame is the the heavy duty of the material used but their design lack finesse if you look at the price point for a simple silvia you can get heck a lot more feature under breville brand i find breville be very reliable and if they fail it is likely because of user error or improper maintenance and of course because their machine are way more sophisticated than rancilio and have more moving part gaggia is owned by philip saeco and have long merged product line and is known for superautomatics their manual product line like the classic were designed prior to the merger and have a lot of quality issue for a rather simple machine if you balance out feature modern day convenience quality and price point breville brand seems to always hit the perfect balance so much so others are copying their design just so you know i own quite a few delonghi everyone of them have very notable design flaw poor design choice tradeoff and reliability issue but because they have such a strong retail presence so it is hard to ignore when you are dealing with a sea of product i now basically have a rule that we will not buy any more delonghi brand product at my home and a well a workplace w while breville make some nice machine i would not talk that way about them they make very good machine with lot of feature but a far a i know they are not build to last a long time like a gaggia or a rancilio breville is absolutely the best delonghi can not compete i rank delonghi in mr coffee is league cheap mass produced stuff with cost cutting a principle a a technical person i am amazed by the product engineer and product manager at breville the amount of thought going into every detail is just fantastic they do make the best of the best of semi auto machine but they do cost a bit more i have delonghi super auto at home god worst engineering in the world after my delonghi dy i will go back to breville not to be a snob coffee troll or anything but i am somewhat surprised you are reviewing a dollar100 dollar machine these are rarely reliable and rarely can you produce even an adequate shot of espresso with them this is like trying to put lipstick on a pig i have owned one returned it express postage and watched several reputable review with similar priced machine and the quality technology is just not there at least for now mary ligon i have seen folk that do testing remark since my post that of all the cheap machine out there the delonghi probably give you the best shot at getting a good shot my good machine needed some fixing and i picked up i can not remember the name but it wa a disaster glad it is working out for you though delonghi is a reputable maker my dollar120 delonghi ecp3420 work great i get better espresso than anything i ever had at xbucks or many other coffee place take experimentation but i have settled on the coffee and method that work very well for me at least 4 espresso a day with this machine for 6 month it is running like new important to keep the basket clean clear the little hole in the bottom of the basket descale etc mine is been reliable so far with taking care of it i know people who have had serious problem with their machine costing several hundred of dollar sometimes it is the machine sometimes user care or lack thereof of course that is not straight across the board for everyone but a someone who could but never would spend hundred on a coffee machine i am very happy with with my well cared for little pig wear her lipstick quite well w you have me looking into getting this machine now thanks for the info boba squid just want to follow up on a comment i wa buying an ecmp50 a a christmas gift for someone and noticed the price jumped a lot because of covid and increase in demand for these machine both amazon and walmart seem to have raised their price even just last year the ecmp50 wa selling at dollar79 nearly constantly if you want to buy one you might want to wait for the price to return to pre pandemic stage allie kraft thanks for the video what grind setting do you use on the capresso we miss you gail fretic exactly people kept commenting about how they wanted gail so much she had to come out and make a video people should just give the new gen a chance dude let her retire come baaack first espresso first
1,Delonghi Stilosa Unboxing & Review |,you do not have to de pressurize this machine right i am used to having to do that and it feel weird to just turn it off and be done hi are all expresso machine so noisy like this one lower price machine will be noisier more plastic le insulation but they all do make noise a the pump use pressure and those with grinder are noisier we have a video on this too can anyone tell me why the coffee doe not taste stong enough to me it seems the espresso shot is abit to watery ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you for the quick reply i used pre ground bean i will look for a coarser grind or grind my own thanks for the suggestion i am new to this malynda g might be too fine think pebble and baby powder pebble water would go right through baby powder it would never go through someplace in between i have the same problem i use the finer grind and now the water just pool above the coffee grind and i still have a watery coffee when i remove the basket it is a mess the water splash everywhere with the coffee grind ha anyone else had this issue and how do you fix it start with a finer grind gosh u said it wa good for an entry level so many time that it sounded like u were knocking it and my son just gave me this for christmas and u totally knocked my excitement to the gutter the price point is entry level good machine but keep in mind we sell a lot of machine up to about dollar5000 so we want to keep perspective i hope you enjoy it are the maintenance and cleaning required similar to performing a surgical procedure like nepresso yikes this is hilarious def not getting a nespresso lol i bought a similar machine i love it so much and decided to start a youtube channel making very nice drink with it you did a great review my video are coming soon so a finer grind make a bigger shot of espresso am i understanding that correctly my parent were thinking of getting me this machine for christmas so wa just looking into it to see what it is all about i am a beginner btw lol i also live in canada and wondering what kind of pod to buy and where to get them tia hi jamie a finer grind will not make a bigger shot the grind affect the quality of the brew if too coarse the water go through quickly and you do not get espresso if too fine the water can not pas through the coffee and you will get a low volume shot if any if you are buying pod a a beginner you are looking for ese pod only and make sure the machine ha an adaptor 5 00 if he can not say the inexpensive mass produced machine make crappy espresso then it is making good espresso the shot looked fine seems it would only need a proper grind of some good coffee to make a really good espresso bonus with the water dispenser configured a it is you can probably even do pre infusion by twisting that side control a you introduce water into the portafilter but if you can afford it a 200 euro machine might be a sweet spot before you get to 500 or so where you can get something much better for not that much more money so this one if that is all you can afford otherwise i would watch a lot of review of sloghtly more expensive one because there are some gem i think it preinfuses a little take a while before it hit with full pressure i like it a lot since it is my first one and i just wanted something to make cappuccino in hindsight i would have gotten the ec230 without the pressurized basket and the modern steamer but it is probably the best thing you can get for that price range a lot of machine around 100 buck are shit a friend ha a 3000 euro machine and yes it is way way better but it make good coffee still dialing in everything and the steamer is fine once you get used to it next machine will probably be in the 500 euro range after i have used this for a year or two anyone having leaking issue from bottom of machine help we have not seen this issue however after consulting with our service technician it could be a variety of issue perhaps a crack on the internals a gasket issue etc the machine ha a 2 year manufacturer warranty with delonghi so you may be able to take advantage of that and get it repaired or replaced so i can not put my own ground coffee in lame yes you can or ese pod great straightforward host by frothing doe this machine mean splatter it all over hell and half of italy it seems really fast i am not so sure about that the scoop is it measured 1 scoop per shot you want to make i did like what i saw i will subscribe thank you ec  1 thing i am confused about in your video you never showed where you poured the water into versus the milk do both go into the removable clear plastic container in the machine so if i fill the clear container with max water and fill the handle with espresso fine will the machine automatically only make 1 shot of espresso or i have to eye it up and stop the machine i noticed just now it used all of the water in the container so filled up my entire cup and after my shot is done when i open up the handle the entire thing is still full of fine espresso grind but wet am i supposed to have that in the handle still after i am finished i see so only water go into the back of the actual machine and that water is used for frothing the milk just pours cold into a cup onto the cooked espresso i am brand new to all of this there is no place to put the milk in the machine you will not find that in this price point the milk go into a frothing pitcher and the wand put steam into the pitcher and then you pour into your mug cup  just got mine so excited thank you for this bought this machine today did my first cappuccino just now and i should say it taste delicious doe the metal cup for the milk come with the machine no that is an extra just got this machine after using a pod only system for awhile i am trying to get a feel for how long to let the water run when making a shot should i kill it briefly after seeing the color change i think i am going a bit too long since the taste is a bit watery hey i had that same question i found an experienced barista here on youtube she ha this same unit like myself and she said 18 second is the best i found other place that said 16 20 second for a double shot taste the best i tried it on mine this morning and it wa great hope this help it is a personal taste thing play around with it you can google the perfect shot time for your length of beverage that you prefer i got this more christmas and a today the frothing is not working very sad because i really liked it did not last long not even a month very nice review doe it ha plastic rubber anywhere food touch thanks yes inside the portafilter and the tank also made in china hard pas claudia is atelier a much a i possibly can low price point machine hard to do otherwise unfortunately if i am used to starbucks espresso would this be better i am kind of picky with coffee store so that is my issue starbucks used to sell this machine in store got it a a gift for christmas i used pre ground cafe bustelo it doe not have the same depth of flavor that you would get from starbucks put another way if someone poured a shot and put it in a starbucks cup you would notice it could be my skill or lack thereof nonetheless it work for me have you tried kaladi brother coffee some of the best coffee on this planet roasted in alaska would you consider this an entry level machine yes and it is mentioned in the video can you make ice coffee with this machine fill a medium glass with ice pour a long espresso bit more liquid maybe double or bit le into a cup add sugar if desired pour over ice add milk do not stir for beautiful texture if you do not want sugar pour it directly on the ice from the machine it is instantly ready just use cold milk from the fridge just put ice over espresso shot and it will make it ice coffree eventually what brand of coffee should i buy i personally love black rifle coffee they have many different type the type you would want for this would be the all 47 espresso how similar is this to the 235 bk model and have you had any experience with it thanks for the video but this one is not available in my country nisha doe life got the ec685 instead but i agree you have to remove the metal piece otherwise it is impossible not to make a ton of bubble had to secure the inner rubber piece with something or you risk it shooting off the machine i am able to get milk to the right consistency if i remove the metal piece and use 6 oz of milk in my mug the wand is not too long so having too little milk make it a bit more difficult but still can be done deyovic thanks for the update clarissa i did not but what i found out is that is generally better to go for the dedica 685 if you want to have a long term solution and superior extraction i am hoping for a sale during the holiday season if none come i will buy it retail did you find out i am curious too hi i am between buying ec155 ec156 and stilosa any advice see my response in another thread the stilosa is better in almost every way granted it is not time proven ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you hi from greece ec 155 is proven that would be my choice how doe the taste of the coffee stack up against more expensive machine like 250 300 gbp you get more control with a more expensive machine the equipment is only one part of it but an experienced barista can pull a good shot from most machine the grind is very very important i noticed this espresso machine make you manually turn off the machine from continuing to drip why is that ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear perfect thank u so much hi tutorial tim you will find that there are machine out there that have the volume control set amount of water dispensed and some that do not often time it is a personal preference this is delonghi is entry level machine with a great price point if you wanted a machine that will automatically stop they do have that available in the dedica model and some others they are more expensive but also more convenient all of the water from the reservoir will continue to come out you have to pay attention nice vids i subbed this deserves way more view i would recommend using smzeus c o m to grow your channel please have a more experienced barista try the steam wand i would really like to know if there is a sufficient vortex being produced with the result being frothing worthy of latte art the wand is only 2 5 8 long hopefully it is long enough to do the job thanks our in house baristas can get latte art but it is a challenge with such an entry level machine hi thanks for the test this ha been done professionally i would like to ask for a small favour could you check what is the max height of cup you can use i just answered myself the delonghi site say 110mm thanks for the review that wa super helpful i wa considering this compared to the longstanding ec155 philsipad very helpful but what about the taste of coffee philsipad wow thank you for this detailed comparison very helpful i just got this machine to replace an ec155 that finally broke after eight year there are numerous difference 1 the filter click into the portafilter and no longer need a lever on the handle to stop the filter from falling out when you try to tap out the coffee ground 2 the 2 shot filter is actually big enough for 2 shot the ec155 two shot filter is way too small 3 you can see the water tank water level much easier 4 the water tank actually hold more water but only by a little 5 the frother is controlled by a lever on the right instead of a knob on the top freeing up top space for warming cup and is faster to operate 6 more space under portafilter to accommodate taller cup 7 doe not have a built in tamper 8 frother is on the right side 9 frother nozzle seems much easier to clean making it more sanitary 10 ha a slightly large footprint 11 doe not vibrate a much you no longer need to hold the espresso cup in place during extraction all in all the stilosa is better in every way except for the frother being on the right side i would not buy a ec155 again i think the biggest difference i noticed wa the steam wand the ec155 ha a panerello might have spelled that wrong which is built to be easy to use and help if you just want hot foamy milk but not great if you want to play around with milk texture but this newer model appears to have a manual which is good if you do also i do not remember the exact size but i think the newer model ha a smaller water tank but yeah honestly they are both pretty similar i feel like there must be some internal change for it to have a totally different name since on the outside it is so similar apart from the wand another thing is if you want to get into modifying or upgrading the machine with different part if you need to replace something or get it serviced the ec155 is definitely the better pick a m we always like tried and true you may have a hard time finding the older model a we have not seen them in a while thank you for the demo liked and subbed i just received an entry level machine similar in function and price i have enjoyed cafe con leche made in moka pot so i thought i would try it with an espresso machine understanding that traditionally a cafe con leche is made with scalded milk 183 degree f the cafe con leche coffee to milk ratio is standard at 1 1 with my espresso machine a 25 second brew yield 4 oz of coffee should i froth 4 oz of milk for it or is their a different rule whatever when using the espresso machine frother many thanks ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear many thanks for your reply asking the baristas around here we all believe you are correct with the 4oz of milk no difference perhaps our community can answer also
2,MORNING COFFEE ROUTINE WITH DELONGHI STILOSA (EC260BK),still liking the setup wich is your dosing funnel i have bought one but it doe not fit in i purchased this machine and now i want to upgrade to a gaggia classic pro eventually i will get a dual boiler machine but i want to stick around dollar500 hi can be used with coffee pod the bottomless should be 51mm right are there another spec nice hi where did u get the bottomless portafilter what i liked about this model is that it doe not have an onboard clock mybest kitchen i live in my rv where the 120v go off and on often a i move around so it wa impossible to set the clock therefore it came on or went off at odd time this one doe not have the temperature setting either so it is a little hotter than i wa used to i drink 5 6 cup of coffee a day caf and decaf different flavor a reliable k cup machine is perfect for me and my lifestyle two thing i recently got this and nothing in the manual instruction or any print material with the machine actually say the size of the portafilter what size is the portafilter secondly i ask because i would like to order a bottomless portafilter for my machine however i can not find one for delonghi anywhere where di you get this one thanks 51 mm with 2 ear two thing i recently got this and nothing in the manual instruction or any print material with the machine actually say the size of the portafilter what size is the portafilter secondly i ask because i would like to order a bottomless portafilter for my machine however i can not find one for delonghi anywhere where di you get this one thanks 51 mm with 2 ear same question i recently got this machine and having a bit of trouble my steamer is not even a half a powerful a the one shown and the steam is lukewarm also my espresso pours out with in 5 second if anyone ha any tip that would be awesome jackson steevens try removing the silver tip from the steamer under the silver wand should be a rubber nozzle that should work better also you can steam a little longer after the green light go off repeat the steaming process a couple time and your milk should be good it take a while but the texture i get from oat milk is still hot good and latte art usable homebaristant hey thanks for the quick response everything i have is still stock i am using one of my favorite local shop espresso blend and giving it an extra grind before packing it in the one thing i do not have yet is a metal cup for frothing the milk i have been using a mug mostly but trying to follow all of the standard instruction for frothing and it just get super foamy on top and doe not change past that usually end up being pretty lukewarm too how is your setup looking like have you changed thing like the portafilter do you turn the power knob to steam mode and wait for the green light before steaming what kind of coffee are you using fresh ground preground there is a lot of question but i think i may be able to help grind setting depending on the freshness of coffee i can grind on the breville grinder pro anywhere from 16 10 on the grind setting great video so i am wondering what is the point of the metal wand for the frother if it can not easily make nice textured milk i figured i should take it off but felt like it wa incorrect any thought on this foxotic no worry i got mine a a birthday present so i am in the same boat if you want to learn how to properly steam the milk using the rubber tip i would strongly recommend the steam milk for latte art video by lance hedrick personally have not found a better explanation than that one elliot cassidy perfect explanation thank you make sense now got mine a a christmas gift foxotic the assumption is that when people buy a machine at this price point they do not wish to spend their time learning how to steam their milk properly so they add the metal guard which leaf load of room between the milk and where the steam exit the rubber tip to inject air into the milk a you said you end up with wayyy more bubble and too much froth reality you want a little gap a possible so you can control how much air you add etc for most people buying this machine they see the bubble and the foam and they are happy whereas we see it and want it done properly hence why we take off the metal bit homebaristant what do you mean by automatically still confused because i am not sure it is me but i can not make nice foam with the metal on the bubble are always way too frothy and large but i do not have a problem when i take it off why would someone want this thank you so much i have been busy with school so i have not had the time to record or reply the metal wand automatically whip air into your milk so when it get hot enough to pour you end up with a ton of foam if you want more control over how much foam you want i suggest removing it some people also have a problem with the rubber tip popping off when steaming just use a clean zip tie where the rubber nozzle connects to the steamer what sort of portafilter do you have it wa off of amazon though the reason i did not add any affiliate link is because i can not even find it anymore it is a bottomless portafilter that allows you to see how your espresso is being extracted could i get a link to the bottomless portafilter that your using im looking to get one and i wan na make sure i am getting a compatible one hello richard sorry but the same portafilter that i have you can not find on amazon anymore there are ton that are very similar out there on amazon though so there should be no problem finding a similar one i believe this is a 51mm bottomless portafilter tooth pick in a cork genius i bought this same machine i love it so much and decided to start a youtube channel making very nice drink with it you did a great review my video are coming soon thank you for watching that is so cool too i am glad you are enjoying your machine and making content do you have link thanks excellent demonstration pre infuse to avoid early channeling great video i did not know it wa possible to get a bottomless portofilter with the stilosa good to know hello can i get a link for your 51mm bottomless portafilter please good video much better after i muted it and played in another tab have you tried any other port filter off amazon i am looking now and the one you got say out of stock i really want you his for my machine which is the same a yours thanks for any info which portafilter did you buy if you do not mind me asking the channeling wa minimal really but if it is a concern have you considered that this machine allows you to pre infuse check out this vid you can do the same thing if possible can you link the portafilter you purchased also do you know how many gram the basket that came with it hold if he did not answer after 7 month i do not think he will did you ever find one i am still looking nice wa not a fan of potential bpa plastic so the bottomless is nice i would not use the plastic steamer though but that is just me honestly i love your gadget and your hair look like latte art just purchased the same setup inspired by your video since this wa posted a few month ago have you made any change to your brewing routine would love to see more video nothing pretentious just awesome to see someone really know how to maximize an espresso machine really good stuff genuinely impressed caf zinho top do you recommend this machine what grind setting wa the breville pro set to in this video i have the same machine but i typically produce a lot le crema with each shot homebaristant i just got a similar setup and wa trying to dial it in today my breville grinder wa at 8 today and still wa way too fast that is interesting you use a light roast of dark roast i wa probably getting close to 50g of liquid in 15 second i am wondering if perhaps the liquid is bypassing the puck on the outside because it is too fine in the video i believe it wa set at 15 but depending on the bean it can range anywhere between 15 9 i have not gone finer since this machine end up choking past 9 but crema is typically associated with how fresh your bean are so the fresher your bean the more crema you should produce i recommend using fresh bean that are one to two week past it original roast date you do not want it to be too fresh oddly enough and you do not want it too stale old which might be your case i am thinking about picking up a delonghi stilosa myself since my budget is pretty low i will be using lavazza pre ground to make my espresso shot what is the purpose of getting the bottomless portafilter rather than just using the portafilter that come with the machine also what is the purpose of the distribution tool homebaristant i depressurized my stock basket and the result is ok with lavazza preground espresso perfetto however i ordered a single cup la pavona basket that i modified with plier and a vice grip a explained in several tutorial here on youtube excellent ristretto with this filter and self grounded coffee bean the portafilter that come with the machine is a pressurized portafilter this mean that your grind quality will not really matter and will pretty much make something similar to crema but not quite the bottomless portafilter is not necessary but it is a regular unpressurized portafilter meaning your grind quality will most definitely matter the bottomless just allows you to see what is going on during extraction you can always depressurize the original portafilter but then you would not want to use preground thanks alat grinder nya pakai apa pak how many mm is your portabfilter and what portagfilter do you use thank you nice video i am a coffee drinker i recently had some nespresso and oh my goodness wa it delicious i would like some espresso at home but can not find myself to pay so much for nespresso i may consider this machine what coffee brand do you buy one problem that i have is that i do not like milk or cream is drinking espresso with sugar good homebaristant thank you doe that coffee taste better than nespresso pod hello vanessa i usually buy bean from my local coffee shop i try to buy the one that have been roasted fairly recently the latest being a week from the day i purchased you should also take a look at cat amp cloud bean online they are a santa cruz ca based company that ha cafe is but also roast their own bean i have taking a liking to their best friend blend a for espresso and sugar you can definitely do an americano with sugar it is just adding hot water to your espresso to make a full cup try it out i definitely have to a well thanks for the nice video i searched amazon for the portafilter but the one i can find ha some bad review concerning the fixing screw of the filter getting loose constantly could you please confirm either if that is no issue for you or point to the portafilter you actually bought thanks so much oh i found it down in the comment thanks great work how do you got the expresso taste where can i buy the naked portfilter with 2 tip for my ec 235 hey whats your process for cleaning the inside of the machine to prevent limescale build up i usually descale the machine once every one to two month hello doe your basket disassembles from your portafilter and get stuck in the machine because i got the same basket an in pare with the stock delonghi portafiter it get stuck a it also doe not lock in the portafilter i ordered the same bottomless portafileter from aliexpress and im waiting for it to get delivered hoping that i wont get the same result with it ah it look like this is one piece no filter to exchange like with the original piece homebaristant did you buy an extra filter a well i am wondering a you did not list any and it doe not come with the portafilter doe it homebaristant ok thanks for the answer i will continue to use the delonghi is basket from which i have removed the spring to depressurise it until i get the new portafilter hello i would wait to use your aftermarket basket with the new portafilter i had the same issue trying to use the basket on the original portafilter you can also play around with the spring to make the basket a little tighter but i would not recommend that haha i just bought the same machine i am pretty happy with it too i used to work at a coffee bubbly tea shop a while back and missed the feeling but did not want to spend dollar200 dollar700 on a home esp machine when i do not drink coffee everyday did the rubber spout ever pop off for you though i read about it popping off for some people while they were steaming milk and some are recommending to keep it attached with a cable tie which i did too work wonder even though i wish the spout were longer i even saw a vid of a dude modifying a different model delonghi wand and switching it out with a rancilio wand stuff wa legit not sure if delonghi caught up to that and made change to their model so no one can modify it though ha anyway great vid how many gram of coffee doe the portafilter take can the portafilter hold 21 gram homebaristant thank you very much the pf can take around 16 18 gram of coffee i have played around a little bit and feel that 16 gram is a good dosage nice video i just bought the same machine and i m getting wet puck with a fine cut 2 2 2 any advice can you also send a link of the distribution tool 51mm michael aye are you using the portafilter that came with the machine if so i have the same problem homebaristant i got the same filter a in the video now and i do not understand it huge filter size with grind setting 5 on my virtuoso i barely can make 14 gram fit in using one go using an intermediate tamping i can squeeze about 18 gram in but then the shot is so very strong using my dark espresso roast and if i just use 14 gram the puck will be soup like any advice is there a filter size reducer available to only make single shot with this portafilter thank you wet puck are going to be a common thing on machine that do not have a three way solenoid valve a long a your puck is not soupy you should be fine if it is very soup like try increasing your dose or go finer on the grind setting hope this help edit almost forgot here is the link for the distribution tool can you show how you changed the frothing wand hello catherine if you have the same exact model a i do removing the pannarello wand is fairly simple it is a easy a turning the pannarello wand sleeve counter clockwise about 1 4 of a full rotation and you should be able to pull it down and out just be careful if you have a different delonghi model a some have much shorter rubber nozzle underneath than this one hope this help can you send a link for the bottomless portafilter and distribution tool please of course no problem the bottomless pf went up in price but this is the exact one i purchased distribution tool is that art of a but whole for an age restricted video i had high hope for a topless barista preferably female i should thumb down this video for setting me up for a big disappointment haha sorry i am just concerned about mindlessly saying or doing something that fall under the age restriction category i will try to not disappoint next time how can yours possibly push through coffee tamped that hard i have the same machine and it can not do that have you changed the basket or depressurized the original one what kind of grinder do you have how about your dosage
