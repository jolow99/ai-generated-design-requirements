0,DeLonghi Stilosa EC260 Espresso Machine | Crew Review,thanks coffee grinder info great video but i wish you had shown the cleaning process i am lazy when it come to cleaning that is why i do not have a juicer they are a nightmare to clean this machine is very sweet working i just bought a brand new one from a reseller super satisfied with the espresso i make with it for it is price a little noisy but worth it thank you for this video wondering what i am doing wrong my shot drip into my cup instead of having a nice stream a yours did i am brand new to the espresso machine can you help me out still delonghi is a dishonest company with stupid engineer doing bad designes and lye 15 bar lol not even close can you use pod with this machine mine ha the ese label on it and i do not know how to use pod or if i can i have one but idk if i am using the right ground coffee i am confused a to how to use the extra coffe holder how doe that fit into the portafiller so doe it come with a tamper are the maintenance and cleaning required similar to performing a surgical procedure like nepresso doe it come w the grinder already hi there what wa that coffee grinder called cheer i have a similar machine and i am just confused at when to stop pulling the shot i thought the machine would stop on it own after the shot is done but it keep going so i really do not know when to stop it could someone help me on that im also very new to espresso but i recommend getting a 1 ounce espresso cup and once it is full you turn it off one ounce is one shot of espresso so if you want 2 shot use 2 one ounce cup then after brewing your shot you can pour them into your big cup hope this help haha i bought a similar machine i love it so much and decided to start a youtube channel making very nice drink with it you did a great review my video are coming soon we warm our milk to 140 degree and end up with half foam half milk she mention removing a metal piece on the want but we do not see how any suggestion we are wasting a lot of milk other than that love the machine you probably already figured this out by now but the metal tube on the wand twist off this video is very helpful my machine is weird i used to be a barista and could make pretty decent coffee and froth milk and get microfoam with this one nah when the machine say the frothing setting is on it will work for about 12seconds and then get weak and stop the green light will come off a if the water got cold then i have to wait till it come on again it is always interrupted never just one time i am having the same issue one strategy i found helpful is to let it prime a little longer after the green light come on like 3 5 extra minute hope this help out of 14 gram of coffee how many gram of brew about 43 gram when i am doing my espresso it is always water coming out from the evaporator why any help please u have to rinse them out a u can see in this video this machine only work with ground coffee i use my grinder and the machine make a lot of noise and do not brew and spit the water from the frot not from the portafilter is a mess can someone help me pls is this the same a stilosa 235 bk i would like to comment that on this machine you have to stop the dial when making your shot i time mine to about 30 second for the double shot and i like it that way good luck update for a double shot i usually stop it around the 17 second mark it depends on the espresso and the grind but i find that with some brand more than 20 second end up tasting pretty watery thank you this is why i came here this is exactly what i wa wondering so then should i fill the water well all the way or should i also try to measure guess how much water to use for one serving this is my only complaint with this machine i do not want to guess when my brew is finished okay thanks i wa thinking the machine wa going to stop on it own and it never dead lol so i appreciate that i wa wondering how much a shot would be just bought this machine and have had really terrible shot the espresso come out unbelievably watery i have fiddled with the grind tamp pressure etc but still no luck doe anyone have any suggestion really want to give this a chance before returning it ana mcdonald how many ml do you end up with at 30seconds i got like 105 and i stopped at 25seconds taste watered down i time my shot right from the first drop i start the timer and leave it for 30 second then stop the machine it a little annoying to have to time them every time but worth it since this machine doe not stop on it own so is the bigger filter for a double shot amp the smaller filter a single shot trying to figure it out yes that is correct doe the green ready light go off and on while you are frothing mine doe also i like to steam my milk to 160 degree so there are time when the steam stop altogether or slows to a slightly audible hiss i have to turn off the steam wait a few second then steam again but in doing this i get water mixed with steam for a few second afterward sometimes the steam quits mid frothing sometimes not i have experimented using a glass bowl to watch how the steam peforms and it is inconsistent at best any input here also there is a tiny indentation in the silver frothing sleeve about 1 4 inch from the top collar is this an air intake if so why is it sealed doe it come with the pitcher no i like the delonghi also i am very interested in the grinder can anyone tell me the make and the model of the grinder thanks so much in advance my email is chungchencho icloud com how do you know when to stop time it i start my stopwatch on the first drop i see i leave for 30 second then stop the dial thats for a double shot how to change the basket when i first bought it the basket wa already in the portafilter and i can not get it out hi i use a wooden spoon fork thing there should be a little gap near the handle where you can insert something under the basket lip to apply leverage to the basket i love how your video are naturally presented with these beautiful little mistake tx scg kannon keanu scammer kannon keanu instablaster i know im asking the wrong place but doe any of you know of a way to get back into an instagram account i wa stupid forgot my account password i appreciate any tip you can give me hi im having problem with my shot it doe not have any crema or bubbling this machine is full of rubber hose and soft plastic it water temperature is too high and overextracts coffee if you knew what you are taliking about you would have 1 run water through the machine several time before 2 tasted the espresso without the milk 3 shown the water tank is made out of white soft plastic with bpas and 4 would have noticed the basket filter is 50percent rubber which would have hopepully doubtedly alarmed you you would know there is no such thing a a cheap and decent espresso machine because a decent espresso machine offer at least some control over the water temperature and doe not have a soft plastic water tank you would know any brand new decent espresso machine cost a lot because it would include rock solid material and technology of temperature and pressure control espresso drinking is a science and an art espresso coffee is tested first without milk actually it is not tested with milk first but you are just a sale person who display a total lack of knowledge of the espresso industry it take at least more than dollar1 000 to buy a decent machine without rubbery and plasticky material soft plastic and rubber cause cancer this machine in particular smell like rubber and leak rubbery smell all over not only because it interior is made of rubber hose and soft plastic it basket filter is made of rubber but also because it pump produce excessive pressure and heat it water at too high boiling temperature but of course you would not care to even notice that it portafilter and filter are 50percent rubber because you belong to the fast coffee culture who think expresso mean fast boiled latte and cappuccino mean steam wand this machine is for the most ignorant population and it saddens me that delonghi make such dirt i fell in this trap a a prey consumer of this cheap and rubbery machinery until i learned what it take to produce balanced and finely tuned coffee drink if you like your expressos taste like rubbery coffee go ahead and keep drinking out of unpacked rubbery machine and keep believing you can buy a brand new decent and solid espresso machine with it interior made of healthy copper and steel for le than dollar1 000 keep enjoying your commercial coffee drink might a well be all you know a far a espresso culture go bro go touch some grass lmao how doe it compare to the dedica from the spec it look really similar for a lower price these machine are truly bad plastic interior and fake basket filter it is sooo sad nah you did not taste the espresso in it pure state you do not know much about this abueloraton this machine is just a simple device for prosumer use for those who want a reasonably priced espresso machine for their counter top it is not meant for professional use in a cafe or restaurant and most people are not wealthy enough to afford a dollar1 000 gigantic machine in their kitchen get a grip on what this product is designed for it is not for coffee snob i know enough to beat the quality of a number of coffee shop i have been to i know enough to enjoy some very nice cup of espresso and i certainly know enough to save a heck of a lot of money in the process for thing more important and long reaching than drinking espresso needing hundred or even thousand of dollar worth of equipment to have a 10 minute drink anyone have leaking from bottom of the machine issue this is not a leak it is some kind of overflow protection these machine are the successor of the former kenwood kmix espresso machine and they also do have this hole on the underside hello how much time should the coffe extraction be or how many ml should the coffe be when it ready for both single and double shot abueloraton cmon you do not have to write 100 of comment about how bad this machine is reading youtube comment to understand how many people like the machine and most of the time i read a negative review it you which is annoying jianli pan i do 30 second for a double lol everyone got ta find their grove with this machine since it doe not automatically stop this machine is so bad it will not produce a balanced extraction no matter what i am wondering the same thing doe the water flow stop automatically you had to turn the dial to stop from the little experience i have with the machine you have to stop the machine after you pull your shot i ended up with a weird americano after my first use lol just ordered one of these for dollar99 off best buy can not wait to try it ha to be an upgrade from my old steam powered goodwill find lol but i understand everyone is frustration you should not need to mod the hell out your machine to get great coffee when you can just buy a breville lol i got mine for dollar25 dollar at a salvage store intact and it really good to use a an introduction into espresso my cup come up great i use lavazza coffee once i feel comfortable enough i think i will up grade to a breville good luck efren ramirez chavez yes it wa dramatically worse redfishcarolina damn fr even compared to your steam powered machine efren ramirez chavez it wa wretched i returned it i blew dollar30 in bean trying to get one decent cup from it but everything wa bitter sour or weak this machine is an outrageous waste of money is a nice machine but even with the double shot i still need a little more punch on my coffee which make a little inconvenient because it will take me longer to make the coffee the way i like it other than that is very user friendly i just need my coffee stronger are nespresso pod compatible in this model or can you open a nespresso pod and dump the content in for the same effect opening the pod or even opening kcups work great which is bettef ec260 or ec235 or ec221 thank u but where the frick is gail look cheap and ugly wtf your espresso will taste like crap after 8 sec if you do not immediately mix it with steamed milk fyi always have your milk steamed and ready to go ghislaincarrier i am a barista and usually the shot of espresso would die in like 15 second if we do not put the milk in there quick enough i hope your realize you said something stupid if i order an espresso at a coffee shop i have 8 second between the time the shot is done and i am done drinking it i hope the barista doe not waste 6 of those 8 second before giving me my cup old myth can not get micro foam no matter what i try i have watched countless video and milk is either too thin or too foamy i have been practicing with frothing soap and water and a cup of water with cocoa powder in it to simulate espresso got tired of wasting my milk but on the plus side the espresso that come out of this machine are very tasty i have had the machine about two week or so and i like it so far gina steimle hi not sure how i would even post picture on a reply but i watch a lot of the people that do latte art either here on youtube or tiktok lot of really good people out there author erica r stinson could you post picture of your latte art i work on mine occasionally and it is just atrocious i need some inspiration thanks author erica r stinson glad to know congrats paulina thanks for writing i have practiced all this past year and now i get microfoam and have been doing latte art fairly decently for a few month now the machine is still working great the latte are good and i am very happy with it all author erica r stinson hey we have replaced our coffee machine it wa new and now it is working perfectly it is actually quite easy to make froth there is no special trick also the milk get hot very quickly before it took like 3 minute to warm up but now it take 20 second so just wanted to let you know this maybe your coffee machine is also defective what kind of grinder is that zach sheffee i know that is she not grinding the coffee bean with a grinder at 4 00 zach sheffee she is not using a grinder to grind the coffee also do you have to change out the coffee every time you brew an espresso and use new coffee every time i am a newbie yes fresh coffee each time the coffee filter came in a bunch of piece doe anyone have a video on how to put it together abueloraton is there any that use glass and the water tank is soft plastic which cause cancer bpas in soft plastic 50percent of the filter made out of rubber and the portafilter ha plastic i just got this and it a pretty nice upgrade from using my aeropress the instruction were not clear about this when you first put water in it to flush the machine out it gon na take a few min before the pump prime and water come out first thing you do after adding water is switch to the brew water setting not the heat up setting then you wait a couple min before the water even come out abueloraton you talk about knowing high quality espresso yet bought a dollar100 piece of junk machine and you should have known what your in store for avolate fpv no it is not consistent you will have problem with it not opening up just wait a few month this is ine of the lowest end machine ever abueloraton ive used high end machine before but they were at restaurant and i do not have the counterspace for a large machine at home sure the portafilter ha some rubber in it but so doe the aeropress the portafilter in this machine ha a spring loaded check valve that only open when it at the right pressure i seems to work pretty good avolate fpv you might not really know high quality espresso this cheap machine overextracts and overpressurizes make coffee much bitter and acid than it is supposed to taste besides it filter and portafilter are 50percent made out of rubber which is absolutely unacceptable and unhealthy avolate fpv it interior are made out of rubber the brew filter check it out is half rubber compressed filter fake pressure it tank is made out of soft plastic which ha bpas it hose are all made out of rubber it overheats the water which cause extra bitterness in the coffee it pump is waaaay too powerful cause coffee brew flow to exceed the standard brew flow rate for espresso which cause poor extraction acidity and it smell and taste like rubber the aeropress is a machine with huge acceptance and following by coffee expert now aeropress is not an espresso brewer if you want espresso aeropress is the wrong tool this delonghi machine make overextracted fake espresso for people who do not really know what espresso really is i am having to return this piece of junk and i have had to switch to french press for the time being at least the french press is not made out of cheap plastic and rubber hose if i ever have an espresso it better be finely tuned that is the whole point of espresso and just so that you know compressurized filter do not generate a full extraction also for your info basket filter should be percent metal not half metal half rubber like the trash you are drinking your commercial supermarket burnt coffee out of how doe this compare to the 230 and the 235 samhondros can you get th 230 in the u it seems to be the only difference is the non pannarello steam wand on the 230 which i see a a plus what kind of coffee grind were you using here how do i make a caramel latte i did not see the step where you added either milk or water to the machine but i did see milk and water come out do you put the milk and the water in at the same time in 2 separate reservoir wtf is wtrh doing rubber hose and soft plastic tank disgusting i had to return it the next day decent espresso machine are sadly expensive because they require solid built alex simone oh good info thanks very much i purchased this exact machine online delivering to me this sunday hi the milk and water do not come out of the machine the espresso just look creamy to make a caramel latte you add caramel syrup to your cup add espresso and then add milk in this video she made a latte without flavor hope that help how long should i hold for the broth i like creme but i am having a hard time with broth milk hold the cup that you are steaming in and slowly pull the container downward until the tip of the frother is just below the surface of the milk this will give it the best froth here is a list that helped me out whinyl com espresso guide in the end i went with 1 4 01 specifically what is it about this machine that make it definitely not latte art worthy i have the machine and not been able to obtain the proper milk consistency for latte art so why doe it have this shortcoming the reason why is because the steamer wa made to make the milk really frothy like in a cappuccino thicker foam is very difficult to create latte art because it is stiff what i managed to figure out is to just steam it like normal with around 8 oz of milk then when done take some of the foam out with a spoon then swirl the pitcher to combine the frothed milk perfect latte art steamed milk should be glossy and look like paint i have a very similar machine ecp 3420 and my understanding is that the steam that come from the wand is not strong enough to spin the milk which is a requirement for making microfoam anyone else is coffee from this machine really weak i have bought really nice bean and it not doing it for me any advice jack brennan i would say if you are grinding your own bean crank your grinder to the finest grind setting you can i have a little mr coffee that ha a pretty fine grind setting on it also i do not believe the machine ha an auto stop for pulling shot are you using to double shot filter or the single shot filter thiccynickyy hey thanks for the great reply i have bought both pre ground bean and whole bean myself and noticed very little difference the water pressure seems okay too so i am really not too sure i have nice bean at the moment but still the coffee is not a strong a it would be from a cafe obviously you can get better machine than this one but i still expected nicer coffee there are either 2 problem why this is occurring the grind of the coffee is not fine enough or the machine doe not use enough pressure to expel the coffee i am not sure if you grind your own bean but you have to make sure whether you do it yourself or have a barista do it for you that it is a fine grind it should be like fine sand if it is not fine enough then it will come out watery and sour and also i forgot to mention but another thing could be that the coffee bean you are using are too much of a light roast lighter roast are usually not a strong a darker one and are used for drip coffee or french press so if you are using a lighter roast i would suggest trying a darker one and finally the machine may have a pressure problem because if you notice it drip slower when brewing then the machine probably doe not expel enough pressure to be consistent i would try troubleshooting it from their customer service or maybe get a replacement if your machine is noticeably broken sorry if this is too long i am just a barista bored at 11pm i have had this machine for a few month now and recently have had issue dispensing espresso after consulting the manual i bought the delonghi descaling solution i followed instruction to the letter and even did an extra cycle of clean water to ensure i wa not going to be brewing the solution into my espresso ala i still can not get my espresso i normally always use the double shot basket i have disassembled and cleaned thoroughly by had and nothing i do not over fill or under fill the basket with ground i tamp it lightly not to light or too firm i still have had no success ha anyone had an issue similar or perhaps any suggestion fill with 4 cup vinegar and run machine till empty do not rely on delonghi customer service they seem to purposely drag out your case so you run out of warranty replacement take a long time to accomplish try a coarse grind because it is already a pressurized portafilter can you use any bean or ground espresso if you use like a starbucks ground coffee in it is that technically espresso espresso is style of coffee but yes there are also espresso bean which are roasted a bit longer than coffee bean when i first had mine 3420 almost the identical machine functionally i tried starbucks bean and asked them to grind it espresso it wa fine like talcum powder and simply would not drip because it became thick sludge in the basket when it got all wet there simply wa not enough pressure to get through the sludge from that extremely fine powdery grind i bought a bodum bistro grinder for dollar70 on sale keep it at the finest setting grind 14 gram using my dollar12 scale tamp it very firmly and there you go make a decent 1 1 2 oz shot in 20 second or so if you do not have a grinder explain to starbucks that you have a pressure basket machine and need the grind to be about like granulated sugar in texture that should get you there you need coffee with an espresso grind it is a good deal finer than you would get from a preground bag you could go to starbucks or a shop that sell bean and have them grind it for an espresso we always recommend grinding what you are going to use right away and keeping the rest whole bean for freshness but if you do not have a grinder it is just fine i do not get how to pull the double shot using the second filter provided the instruction manual doe not provide a good explanation nor illustration and the woman in the video did not provide an explanation either this is frustrating the double shot doe not mean pulling a typical 18 19 gram double shot delonghi call 7 gram a single shot 14 a double shot they should call their double shot a single and a half shot just tamp 14 gram in there real firmly and if your grind is about the fineness of granulated sugar you can manage a nice little 1 1 2 oz to maximum 2 oz espresso partly depends on the bean a to whether you want to keep your shot 1 1 2 or stretch it to 2 it look bigger so two shot is this similar to an ecp 35 31 and would you recommend replacing the pressurised arm thingy with a non pressurised thiccynickyy ok thanks author erica r stinson that is right the more fat in a milk the more foam it will be able to take 2percent will be a little better not much i would try non fat since it is really hard to create foam even if it is a different milk fat content the machine attachment is still going to produce that higher foam level most likely thiccynickyy one thing i may try is 2percent milk a i have been using whole i usually take half and half in my coffee so the more fat in my milk the smoother the coffee will taste but if i am not mistaken the instruction manual state to use 2percent milk i think i saw another answer on here about whole milk having too much fat in it that creates a lot of foam i am willing to try it and see author erica r stinson yeah do not feel bad it is the machine fault you can take the attachment silver part off and steam it with the nozzle which can be more manual to steam milk but even a a barista myself it is pretty hard to get it perfect thiccynickyy i have been using a spoon to take the excess foam off the top when i go to far so this is a really solid piece of advice what is killing me is i think i am really close but i am still missing the mark somewhere got one of these for christmas these type of machine are not really for coffee drinker these are for people who just want stuff pain in the as to get a good cup of coffee save yourself some time money counter space mess and just get a moka pot lauryn hatten hi how did yours go im having the same trouble mary ligon thank you so much for your help lauryn hatten hi lauren i grind mine about the texture of granulated sugar the finest setting on my bodum bistro plus grinder then i tamp it very firmly and run the machine till the top of the crema hit 1 5 2 oz maximum that take around 21 24 second and can vary just slightly with the type of bean and how it is roasted it seems in my experience since the grind is not a fine a might be ideal it is important to really tamp it very firmly it is when i learned to do that my coffee started being really good because the very firm tamping had slowed the extraction down you will read people advising 26 30 second from first drip but this would be for more coffee than a paltry little 14 gr basket try 1 5 oz espresso max 2 and in between i think you might find an improvement good luck with it mary ligon hi thank you how long do you brew it for i am still getting sour shot but i do not want to give up on it just yet lauryn hatten hi lauren i use 14g for the double shot tamp it real firmly and it work great enjoy your ne a machine and some real good coffee anyone else think that is a horrible looking cup of coffee not necessarily the machine is fault i am guessing tony gibbon i wa aware of that when i first got it too but even without the outer part the steam pressure is horrible so it doe not create consistent foam thiccynickyy if you take the outer cover of the steam wand off you can get creamy micro foam milk the weird thing about this machine is that the steamer can only basically steam milk to create thicker froth for like cappuccino so it just look weird and milky probably because of that it is not a cup of coffee it is a latte hi thanks for the video wa exactly i wa looking for also i am gon na start buying my coffee supply at your bellevue store hey how is this different from the dollar150 ecp3420 other than more plastic on stilosa amp more stainless steel on the ecp3420 is there any functional difference also i find it interesting that the more expensive ecp3420 ecp3620 ecp3630 come with 3 filter basket one shot double shot amp ese yet the stilosa only come with two basket with the single basket used for the pod can someone explain that i have the 3420 it basically seems identical just with more stainless trim the basket are 7 gram 14 gram and the other one is for the ese pod never tried the ese pod a i like to use freshly ground coffee rather than old ground coffee wrapped in filter paper this lady make me nervous wa she drunk what am i doing wrong that my machine is so loud check the water container if it is not in right it make it louder andrew savoy i think so too i have not found any solution lol manos fragkiadakis unfortunately not haha i think it just loud lol everyones is loud innthe comment right now my coffee machine is so loud to maybe you found a solution what type of milk shouls i use and also what type of grounded coffee should i buy thank you if you buy your coffee bean from a starbucks peet is or any coffee shop they can grind the bean to an espresso grind fine grind for you if you buy bean from the store however you are going to need a grinder to grind them you can use any type of milk but if you want creamy and foamy milk you need a milk with fat which the best is whole milk non fat you can use but it will be incredibly hard to froth since there is not any fat to froth nicely you have to grind the coffee yourself the grinder is actually much more important than the machine and you should invest more in a good grinder is this better than nespresso original line i think so for my taste the nespresso make a tasty cup but any time one us the pod the coffee ha been ground for a long time and sitting in paper which further absorbs aroma from the ground bean i prefer grinding my own bean and using them immediately i have only had nespresso coffee a few time and do not know if they can use freshly ground coffee or if they only use the pod my e260 is not giving me the green ready light anymore you know why thx is the portafilter stainless steel no half plastic the filter is half rubber this machine is rubbish returned it the very same day nauseating aluminum alloy i would love to know what you think about how this machine compare to the ec155m that your channel reviewed a while back i like the ec155m better prefer the steamer on left side mine just broke after 5 year noticed hardly any creama on video shot what grinder have you featured in this video and what is a good espresso bean grinder for this espresso machine i really like my bodum bistro with my delonghi ecp3420 very similar to this machine being reviewed the bodum go on sale direct from the company fairly regularly mine wa dollar70 scg sell it a well at the lowest setting the grind just work great with this machine just tamp it firmly and hope it all work out for you this is a pressurized machine so most grinder that can grind a bit fine and preground coffee will work it will make you fine espresso if you want some good espresso you could always buy a normal depressurized portafilter and a good grinder though if you want to get into good espresso i would save the money and get a good machine and a good grinder you can find pretty nice second hand deal on a gaggia classic a a machine and a compak grinder or something like that that will be a setup that make damn good coffee i assure you hi thanks for the video i just bought the stilosa and i do not know what i am doing my shot come out watery i want to make cuban coffee and i am just learning about the pressurized basket amp how i have to eyeball the shot can i use something like pre ground bustelo supreme or pilon on this machine please h e l p m e also the delonghi ecp3420 is just dollar22 more did i make the right choice maribeth russell hi maribeth and congrats hope you really enjoy your new machine mary ligon thank you for your comment just bought one and your tip are so helpful tony gibbon hi tony thanks for your thanks no problem with the delay my machine is still going great just like new and am still using it and the steamer daily i have indeed cut my caffeine consumption down a bit but if i need a better jolt and a bigger cup for an early morning with not enough sleep i use 22 gram of dark grind in a pourover i have a big mug that hold 250 gram of poured coffee 100 gram of steamed milk for a total of 350 gram weight of liquid perfect for me and an espresso in the afternoon if i can work it in decaf french roast bean also perfect for me hope you are well and that covid impact is lessening in your world all the best mary ligon hi mary i just wanted to say thanks so much for that thoughtful and helpful reply not sure if i did not see it or i forgot to reply with it being christmas and covid season but i just revisited this video and saw it thank you hope you are still enjoying your machine and maybe your body ha adjusted to the lower dose of caffeine adding that i used the double shot filter with 2 scoop of espresso grind for the 1 1 2 to 2 oz shot what grinder is that capresso infinity hi what will be the best espresso machine for home that will vive una good shot we only make 4 cup daily of coffee kind of depends on what is really important to you in your coffee drinking and what your budget is there are so many option and machine it is impossible to say broadly what is best for you what are the most important feature and result for you and how much do you want to spend good question to start with good luck utter drivel 14grm double sum it up how can any serious coffee shop sell this pap philip davidson what planet do you live on 7g single and 14g double is standard where espresso wa born philip davidson seriously dollar2k for a setup to make a home espresso seriously man i have been using a damned goodwill find steam machine with cheap lavassa bean and a dollar20 blade grinder in other word the most cringe tastic espresso by most standard and while it is definitely just really strong coffee i struggle greatly at tasting much difference between it and what i get at local coffee shop with professional equipment yes different but still pretty good t god just research double boiler machine look at the state of her steaming wand double shot industrial standard 18 gt 20 grm you will be shocked at prosumer price and she admits a much ie it is not up to the job save up buy once the grinder is more important than the machine coffeegeek com is a good start but budget for about 2k for the pair educate me please i want to understand what you are talking about thanks for the video what grind setting do you use on the capresso mary ligon hi mary do you use the smaller version of the bodum bistro grinder or the larger one with the coffee bean is container on top i want to order mine and would like to order the one you mention it is just fir my personal use at home thank you i would suggest the finest since the capresso doe not grind powder fine i use my bodum bistro on it finest setting and tamp very firmly give a pretty good shot and a dry puck espresso is a very fine grind on most commercial grade grinder it is either a 1 or 2 yes what grind setting did she use she should have shown u doe it make a lot of noise when brewing using the machine there is a special place in hell for those who make these little low power espresso machine have you tried using this particular model which wa recently improved i have a 155 i bought for 25 buck on craigslist run a la pavoni unpressurized basket in it and get great result is it a rocket probably not doe it make shot better than 40percent of the shot i have bought out in the world yup now i do agree that making thing not to last is frustrating but i am also happy to be able to get into the hobby without dropping a grand or a special place in heaven for those who make something of espresso affordable to u humble mass is a scam unless you get one and return it before the grace period personally find the cheap breville machine are superior to the delonghi one mrmarki134 you nailed the exact issue with rancilios they are dumb tank they are heavy duty but to a fault just like every industry technology improves most people expect their machine to last 3 5 year and then they will upgrade even with the heavy duty material ranchilios inners are subject to same set of issue of calcium build up rubber seal aging etc even with proper maintenance many component do not out last other machine by a meaningful and useful way i think your argument about build quality is mostly centered around the concept of using metal versus plastic in that regard plastic technology improves and you can see breville is good at adapting those new technology to improve durability and touch feel of their product in that regard phillips also do a good job at it are breville perfect is every sense no but they are pretty darn close a you spend more time making coffee and get to know all the little nuance about the process i think you will appreciate breville more most of u have gone through the same process path w that is quite a good reasoning i completely agree with your point on delonghi and gaggia it kind of pain me to see that a once great company that made awesome machine now make cheap pressurized machine superautomatics and one good machine that is kinda pricy rancilio is machine i like more bc i think i would prefer le feature and more solid build i do not have a machine and i am sure i would love an infuser but i have heard that while they are very convenient they are not tank made to last year and year but who know i am kind of a noob and breville is also a bit young a a company maybe some machine will last a lifetime mrmarki134 i disagree rancilio make trim down commercial like machine for home use they are basically feature and convenience stripped their only claim to fame is the the heavy duty of the material used but their design lack finesse if you look at the price point for a simple silvia you can get heck a lot more feature under breville brand i find breville be very reliable and if they fail it is likely because of user error or improper maintenance and of course because their machine are way more sophisticated than rancilio and have more moving part gaggia is owned by philip saeco and have long merged product line and is known for superautomatics their manual product line like the classic were designed prior to the merger and have a lot of quality issue for a rather simple machine if you balance out feature modern day convenience quality and price point breville brand seems to always hit the perfect balance so much so others are copying their design just so you know i own quite a few delonghi everyone of them have very notable design flaw poor design choice tradeoff and reliability issue but because they have such a strong retail presence so it is hard to ignore when you are dealing with a sea of product i now basically have a rule that we will not buy any more delonghi brand product at my home and a well a workplace w while breville make some nice machine i would not talk that way about them they make very good machine with lot of feature but a far a i know they are not build to last a long time like a gaggia or a rancilio breville is absolutely the best delonghi can not compete i rank delonghi in mr coffee is league cheap mass produced stuff with cost cutting a principle a a technical person i am amazed by the product engineer and product manager at breville the amount of thought going into every detail is just fantastic they do make the best of the best of semi auto machine but they do cost a bit more i have delonghi super auto at home god worst engineering in the world after my delonghi dy i will go back to breville not to be a snob coffee troll or anything but i am somewhat surprised you are reviewing a dollar100 dollar machine these are rarely reliable and rarely can you produce even an adequate shot of espresso with them this is like trying to put lipstick on a pig i have owned one returned it express postage and watched several reputable review with similar priced machine and the quality technology is just not there at least for now mary ligon i have seen folk that do testing remark since my post that of all the cheap machine out there the delonghi probably give you the best shot at getting a good shot my good machine needed some fixing and i picked up i can not remember the name but it wa a disaster glad it is working out for you though delonghi is a reputable maker my dollar120 delonghi ecp3420 work great i get better espresso than anything i ever had at xbucks or many other coffee place take experimentation but i have settled on the coffee and method that work very well for me at least 4 espresso a day with this machine for 6 month it is running like new important to keep the basket clean clear the little hole in the bottom of the basket descale etc mine is been reliable so far with taking care of it i know people who have had serious problem with their machine costing several hundred of dollar sometimes it is the machine sometimes user care or lack thereof of course that is not straight across the board for everyone but a someone who could but never would spend hundred on a coffee machine i am very happy with with my well cared for little pig wear her lipstick quite well w you have me looking into getting this machine now thanks for the info boba squid just want to follow up on a comment i wa buying an ecmp50 a a christmas gift for someone and noticed the price jumped a lot because of covid and increase in demand for these machine both amazon and walmart seem to have raised their price even just last year the ecmp50 wa selling at dollar79 nearly constantly if you want to buy one you might want to wait for the price to return to pre pandemic stage allie kraft thanks for the video what grind setting do you use on the capresso we miss you gail fretic exactly people kept commenting about how they wanted gail so much she had to come out and make a video people should just give the new gen a chance dude let her retire come baaack first espresso first
1,Delonghi Stilosa Unboxing & Review |,you do not have to de pressurize this machine right i am used to having to do that and it feel weird to just turn it off and be done hi are all expresso machine so noisy like this one lower price machine will be noisier more plastic le insulation but they all do make noise a the pump use pressure and those with grinder are noisier we have a video on this too can anyone tell me why the coffee doe not taste stong enough to me it seems the espresso shot is abit to watery ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you for the quick reply i used pre ground bean i will look for a coarser grind or grind my own thanks for the suggestion i am new to this malynda g might be too fine think pebble and baby powder pebble water would go right through baby powder it would never go through someplace in between i have the same problem i use the finer grind and now the water just pool above the coffee grind and i still have a watery coffee when i remove the basket it is a mess the water splash everywhere with the coffee grind ha anyone else had this issue and how do you fix it start with a finer grind gosh u said it wa good for an entry level so many time that it sounded like u were knocking it and my son just gave me this for christmas and u totally knocked my excitement to the gutter the price point is entry level good machine but keep in mind we sell a lot of machine up to about dollar5000 so we want to keep perspective i hope you enjoy it are the maintenance and cleaning required similar to performing a surgical procedure like nepresso yikes this is hilarious def not getting a nespresso lol i bought a similar machine i love it so much and decided to start a youtube channel making very nice drink with it you did a great review my video are coming soon so a finer grind make a bigger shot of espresso am i understanding that correctly my parent were thinking of getting me this machine for christmas so wa just looking into it to see what it is all about i am a beginner btw lol i also live in canada and wondering what kind of pod to buy and where to get them tia hi jamie a finer grind will not make a bigger shot the grind affect the quality of the brew if too coarse the water go through quickly and you do not get espresso if too fine the water can not pas through the coffee and you will get a low volume shot if any if you are buying pod a a beginner you are looking for ese pod only and make sure the machine ha an adaptor 5 00 if he can not say the inexpensive mass produced machine make crappy espresso then it is making good espresso the shot looked fine seems it would only need a proper grind of some good coffee to make a really good espresso bonus with the water dispenser configured a it is you can probably even do pre infusion by twisting that side control a you introduce water into the portafilter but if you can afford it a 200 euro machine might be a sweet spot before you get to 500 or so where you can get something much better for not that much more money so this one if that is all you can afford otherwise i would watch a lot of review of sloghtly more expensive one because there are some gem i think it preinfuses a little take a while before it hit with full pressure i like it a lot since it is my first one and i just wanted something to make cappuccino in hindsight i would have gotten the ec230 without the pressurized basket and the modern steamer but it is probably the best thing you can get for that price range a lot of machine around 100 buck are shit a friend ha a 3000 euro machine and yes it is way way better but it make good coffee still dialing in everything and the steamer is fine once you get used to it next machine will probably be in the 500 euro range after i have used this for a year or two anyone having leaking issue from bottom of machine help we have not seen this issue however after consulting with our service technician it could be a variety of issue perhaps a crack on the internals a gasket issue etc the machine ha a 2 year manufacturer warranty with delonghi so you may be able to take advantage of that and get it repaired or replaced so i can not put my own ground coffee in lame yes you can or ese pod great straightforward host by frothing doe this machine mean splatter it all over hell and half of italy it seems really fast i am not so sure about that the scoop is it measured 1 scoop per shot you want to make i did like what i saw i will subscribe thank you ec  1 thing i am confused about in your video you never showed where you poured the water into versus the milk do both go into the removable clear plastic container in the machine so if i fill the clear container with max water and fill the handle with espresso fine will the machine automatically only make 1 shot of espresso or i have to eye it up and stop the machine i noticed just now it used all of the water in the container so filled up my entire cup and after my shot is done when i open up the handle the entire thing is still full of fine espresso grind but wet am i supposed to have that in the handle still after i am finished i see so only water go into the back of the actual machine and that water is used for frothing the milk just pours cold into a cup onto the cooked espresso i am brand new to all of this there is no place to put the milk in the machine you will not find that in this price point the milk go into a frothing pitcher and the wand put steam into the pitcher and then you pour into your mug cup  just got mine so excited thank you for this bought this machine today did my first cappuccino just now and i should say it taste delicious doe the metal cup for the milk come with the machine no that is an extra just got this machine after using a pod only system for awhile i am trying to get a feel for how long to let the water run when making a shot should i kill it briefly after seeing the color change i think i am going a bit too long since the taste is a bit watery hey i had that same question i found an experienced barista here on youtube she ha this same unit like myself and she said 18 second is the best i found other place that said 16 20 second for a double shot taste the best i tried it on mine this morning and it wa great hope this help it is a personal taste thing play around with it you can google the perfect shot time for your length of beverage that you prefer i got this more christmas and a today the frothing is not working very sad because i really liked it did not last long not even a month very nice review doe it ha plastic rubber anywhere food touch thanks yes inside the portafilter and the tank also made in china hard pas claudia is atelier a much a i possibly can low price point machine hard to do otherwise unfortunately if i am used to starbucks espresso would this be better i am kind of picky with coffee store so that is my issue starbucks used to sell this machine in store got it a a gift for christmas i used pre ground cafe bustelo it doe not have the same depth of flavor that you would get from starbucks put another way if someone poured a shot and put it in a starbucks cup you would notice it could be my skill or lack thereof nonetheless it work for me have you tried kaladi brother coffee some of the best coffee on this planet roasted in alaska would you consider this an entry level machine yes and it is mentioned in the video can you make ice coffee with this machine fill a medium glass with ice pour a long espresso bit more liquid maybe double or bit le into a cup add sugar if desired pour over ice add milk do not stir for beautiful texture if you do not want sugar pour it directly on the ice from the machine it is instantly ready just use cold milk from the fridge just put ice over espresso shot and it will make it ice coffree eventually what brand of coffee should i buy i personally love black rifle coffee they have many different type the type you would want for this would be the all 47 espresso how similar is this to the 235 bk model and have you had any experience with it thanks for the video but this one is not available in my country nisha doe life got the ec685 instead but i agree you have to remove the metal piece otherwise it is impossible not to make a ton of bubble had to secure the inner rubber piece with something or you risk it shooting off the machine i am able to get milk to the right consistency if i remove the metal piece and use 6 oz of milk in my mug the wand is not too long so having too little milk make it a bit more difficult but still can be done deyovic thanks for the update clarissa i did not but what i found out is that is generally better to go for the dedica 685 if you want to have a long term solution and superior extraction i am hoping for a sale during the holiday season if none come i will buy it retail did you find out i am curious too hi i am between buying ec155 ec156 and stilosa any advice see my response in another thread the stilosa is better in almost every way granted it is not time proven ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thank you hi from greece ec 155 is proven that would be my choice how doe the taste of the coffee stack up against more expensive machine like 250 300 gbp you get more control with a more expensive machine the equipment is only one part of it but an experienced barista can pull a good shot from most machine the grind is very very important i noticed this espresso machine make you manually turn off the machine from continuing to drip why is that ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear perfect thank u so much hi tutorial tim you will find that there are machine out there that have the volume control set amount of water dispensed and some that do not often time it is a personal preference this is delonghi is entry level machine with a great price point if you wanted a machine that will automatically stop they do have that available in the dedica model and some others they are more expensive but also more convenient all of the water from the reservoir will continue to come out you have to pay attention nice vids i subbed this deserves way more view i would recommend using smzeus c o m to grow your channel please have a more experienced barista try the steam wand i would really like to know if there is a sufficient vortex being produced with the result being frothing worthy of latte art the wand is only 2 5 8 long hopefully it is long enough to do the job thanks our in house baristas can get latte art but it is a challenge with such an entry level machine hi thanks for the test this ha been done professionally i would like to ask for a small favour could you check what is the max height of cup you can use i just answered myself the delonghi site say 110mm thanks for the review that wa super helpful i wa considering this compared to the longstanding ec155 philsipad very helpful but what about the taste of coffee philsipad wow thank you for this detailed comparison very helpful i just got this machine to replace an ec155 that finally broke after eight year there are numerous difference 1 the filter click into the portafilter and no longer need a lever on the handle to stop the filter from falling out when you try to tap out the coffee ground 2 the 2 shot filter is actually big enough for 2 shot the ec155 two shot filter is way too small 3 you can see the water tank water level much easier 4 the water tank actually hold more water but only by a little 5 the frother is controlled by a lever on the right instead of a knob on the top freeing up top space for warming cup and is faster to operate 6 more space under portafilter to accommodate taller cup 7 doe not have a built in tamper 8 frother is on the right side 9 frother nozzle seems much easier to clean making it more sanitary 10 ha a slightly large footprint 11 doe not vibrate a much you no longer need to hold the espresso cup in place during extraction all in all the stilosa is better in every way except for the frother being on the right side i would not buy a ec155 again i think the biggest difference i noticed wa the steam wand the ec155 ha a panerello might have spelled that wrong which is built to be easy to use and help if you just want hot foamy milk but not great if you want to play around with milk texture but this newer model appears to have a manual which is good if you do also i do not remember the exact size but i think the newer model ha a smaller water tank but yeah honestly they are both pretty similar i feel like there must be some internal change for it to have a totally different name since on the outside it is so similar apart from the wand another thing is if you want to get into modifying or upgrading the machine with different part if you need to replace something or get it serviced the ec155 is definitely the better pick a m we always like tried and true you may have a hard time finding the older model a we have not seen them in a while thank you for the demo liked and subbed i just received an entry level machine similar in function and price i have enjoyed cafe con leche made in moka pot so i thought i would try it with an espresso machine understanding that traditionally a cafe con leche is made with scalded milk 183 degree f the cafe con leche coffee to milk ratio is standard at 1 1 with my espresso machine a 25 second brew yield 4 oz of coffee should i froth 4 oz of milk for it or is their a different rule whatever when using the espresso machine frother many thanks ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear many thanks for your reply asking the baristas around here we all believe you are correct with the 4oz of milk no difference perhaps our community can answer also
2,MORNING COFFEE ROUTINE WITH DELONGHI STILOSA (EC260BK),wow ty for this i just ordered my machine today i am so excited to try it out still liking the setup wich is your dosing funnel i have bought one but it doe not fit in i purchased this machine and now i want to upgrade to a gaggia classic pro eventually i will get a dual boiler machine but i want to stick around dollar500 hi can be used with coffee pod the bottomless should be 51mm right are there another spec nice hi where did u get the bottomless portafilter what i liked about this model is that it doe not have an onboard clock mybest kitchen i live in my rv where the 120v go off and on often a i move around so it wa impossible to set the clock therefore it came on or went off at odd time this one doe not have the temperature setting either so it is a little hotter than i wa used to i drink 5 6 cup of coffee a day caf and decaf different flavor a reliable k cup machine is perfect for me and my lifestyle two thing i recently got this and nothing in the manual instruction or any print material with the machine actually say the size of the portafilter what size is the portafilter secondly i ask because i would like to order a bottomless portafilter for my machine however i can not find one for delonghi anywhere where di you get this one thanks 51 mm with 2 ear two thing i recently got this and nothing in the manual instruction or any print material with the machine actually say the size of the portafilter what size is the portafilter secondly i ask because i would like to order a bottomless portafilter for my machine however i can not find one for delonghi anywhere where di you get this one thanks 51 mm with 2 ear same question i recently got this machine and having a bit of trouble my steamer is not even a half a powerful a the one shown and the steam is lukewarm also my espresso pours out with in 5 second if anyone ha any tip that would be awesome jackson steevens try removing the silver tip from the steamer under the silver wand should be a rubber nozzle that should work better also you can steam a little longer after the green light go off repeat the steaming process a couple time and your milk should be good it take a while but the texture i get from oat milk is still hot good and latte art usable homebaristant hey thanks for the quick response everything i have is still stock i am using one of my favorite local shop espresso blend and giving it an extra grind before packing it in the one thing i do not have yet is a metal cup for frothing the milk i have been using a mug mostly but trying to follow all of the standard instruction for frothing and it just get super foamy on top and doe not change past that usually end up being pretty lukewarm too how is your setup looking like have you changed thing like the portafilter do you turn the power knob to steam mode and wait for the green light before steaming what kind of coffee are you using fresh ground preground there is a lot of question but i think i may be able to help grind setting depending on the freshness of coffee i can grind on the breville grinder pro anywhere from 16 10 on the grind setting great video so i am wondering what is the point of the metal wand for the frother if it can not easily make nice textured milk i figured i should take it off but felt like it wa incorrect any thought on this foxotic no worry i got mine a a birthday present so i am in the same boat if you want to learn how to properly steam the milk using the rubber tip i would strongly recommend the steam milk for latte art video by lance hedrick personally have not found a better explanation than that one elliot cassidy perfect explanation thank you make sense now got mine a a christmas gift foxotic the assumption is that when people buy a machine at this price point they do not wish to spend their time learning how to steam their milk properly so they add the metal guard which leaf load of room between the milk and where the steam exit the rubber tip to inject air into the milk a you said you end up with wayyy more bubble and too much froth reality you want a little gap a possible so you can control how much air you add etc for most people buying this machine they see the bubble and the foam and they are happy whereas we see it and want it done properly hence why we take off the metal bit homebaristant what do you mean by automatically still confused because i am not sure it is me but i can not make nice foam with the metal on the bubble are always way too frothy and large but i do not have a problem when i take it off why would someone want this thank you so much i have been busy with school so i have not had the time to record or reply the metal wand automatically whip air into your milk so when it get hot enough to pour you end up with a ton of foam if you want more control over how much foam you want i suggest removing it some people also have a problem with the rubber tip popping off when steaming just use a clean zip tie where the rubber nozzle connects to the steamer what sort of portafilter do you have it wa off of amazon though the reason i did not add any affiliate link is because i can not even find it anymore it is a bottomless portafilter that allows you to see how your espresso is being extracted could i get a link to the bottomless portafilter that your using im looking to get one and i wan na make sure i am getting a compatible one hello richard sorry but the same portafilter that i have you can not find on amazon anymore there are ton that are very similar out there on amazon though so there should be no problem finding a similar one i believe this is a 51mm bottomless portafilter tooth pick in a cork genius i bought this same machine i love it so much and decided to start a youtube channel making very nice drink with it you did a great review my video are coming soon thank you for watching that is so cool too i am glad you are enjoying your machine and making content do you have link thanks excellent demonstration pre infuse to avoid early channeling great video i did not know it wa possible to get a bottomless portofilter with the stilosa good to know hello can i get a link for your 51mm bottomless portafilter please good video much better after i muted it and played in another tab have you tried any other port filter off amazon i am looking now and the one you got say out of stock i really want you his for my machine which is the same a yours thanks for any info which portafilter did you buy if you do not mind me asking the channeling wa minimal really but if it is a concern have you considered that this machine allows you to pre infuse check out this vid you can do the same thing if possible can you link the portafilter you purchased also do you know how many gram the basket that came with it hold if he did not answer after 7 month i do not think he will did you ever find one i am still looking nice wa not a fan of potential bpa plastic so the bottomless is nice i would not use the plastic steamer though but that is just me honestly i love your gadget and your hair look like latte art just purchased the same setup inspired by your video since this wa posted a few month ago have you made any change to your brewing routine would love to see more video nothing pretentious just awesome to see someone really know how to maximize an espresso machine really good stuff genuinely impressed caf zinho top do you recommend this machine what grind setting wa the breville pro set to in this video i have the same machine but i typically produce a lot le crema with each shot homebaristant i just got a similar setup and wa trying to dial it in today my breville grinder wa at 8 today and still wa way too fast that is interesting you use a light roast of dark roast i wa probably getting close to 50g of liquid in 15 second i am wondering if perhaps the liquid is bypassing the puck on the outside because it is too fine in the video i believe it wa set at 15 but depending on the bean it can range anywhere between 15 9 i have not gone finer since this machine end up choking past 9 but crema is typically associated with how fresh your bean are so the fresher your bean the more crema you should produce i recommend using fresh bean that are one to two week past it original roast date you do not want it to be too fresh oddly enough and you do not want it too stale old which might be your case i am thinking about picking up a delonghi stilosa myself since my budget is pretty low i will be using lavazza pre ground to make my espresso shot what is the purpose of getting the bottomless portafilter rather than just using the portafilter that come with the machine also what is the purpose of the distribution tool homebaristant i depressurized my stock basket and the result is ok with lavazza preground espresso perfetto however i ordered a single cup la pavona basket that i modified with plier and a vice grip a explained in several tutorial here on youtube excellent ristretto with this filter and self grounded coffee bean the portafilter that come with the machine is a pressurized portafilter this mean that your grind quality will not really matter and will pretty much make something similar to crema but not quite the bottomless portafilter is not necessary but it is a regular unpressurized portafilter meaning your grind quality will most definitely matter the bottomless just allows you to see what is going on during extraction you can always depressurize the original portafilter but then you would not want to use preground thanks alat grinder nya pakai apa pak how many mm is your portabfilter and what portagfilter do you use thank you nice video i am a coffee drinker i recently had some nespresso and oh my goodness wa it delicious i would like some espresso at home but can not find myself to pay so much for nespresso i may consider this machine what coffee brand do you buy one problem that i have is that i do not like milk or cream is drinking espresso with sugar good homebaristant thank you doe that coffee taste better than nespresso pod hello vanessa i usually buy bean from my local coffee shop i try to buy the one that have been roasted fairly recently the latest being a week from the day i purchased you should also take a look at cat amp cloud bean online they are a santa cruz ca based company that ha cafe is but also roast their own bean i have taking a liking to their best friend blend a for espresso and sugar you can definitely do an americano with sugar it is just adding hot water to your espresso to make a full cup try it out i definitely have to a well thanks for the nice video i searched amazon for the portafilter but the one i can find ha some bad review concerning the fixing screw of the filter getting loose constantly could you please confirm either if that is no issue for you or point to the portafilter you actually bought thanks so much oh i found it down in the comment thanks great work how do you got the expresso taste where can i buy the naked portfilter with 2 tip for my ec 235 hey whats your process for cleaning the inside of the machine to prevent limescale build up i usually descale the machine once every one to two month hello doe your basket disassembles from your portafilter and get stuck in the machine because i got the same basket an in pare with the stock delonghi portafiter it get stuck a it also doe not lock in the portafilter i ordered the same bottomless portafileter from aliexpress and im waiting for it to get delivered hoping that i wont get the same result with it ah it look like this is one piece no filter to exchange like with the original piece homebaristant did you buy an extra filter a well i am wondering a you did not list any and it doe not come with the portafilter doe it homebaristant ok thanks for the answer i will continue to use the delonghi is basket from which i have removed the spring to depressurise it until i get the new portafilter hello i would wait to use your aftermarket basket with the new portafilter i had the same issue trying to use the basket on the original portafilter you can also play around with the spring to make the basket a little tighter but i would not recommend that haha i just bought the same machine i am pretty happy with it too i used to work at a coffee bubbly tea shop a while back and missed the feeling but did not want to spend dollar200 dollar700 on a home esp machine when i do not drink coffee everyday did the rubber spout ever pop off for you though i read about it popping off for some people while they were steaming milk and some are recommending to keep it attached with a cable tie which i did too work wonder even though i wish the spout were longer i even saw a vid of a dude modifying a different model delonghi wand and switching it out with a rancilio wand stuff wa legit not sure if delonghi caught up to that and made change to their model so no one can modify it though ha anyway great vid how many gram of coffee doe the portafilter take can the portafilter hold 21 gram homebaristant thank you very much the pf can take around 16 18 gram of coffee i have played around a little bit and feel that 16 gram is a good dosage nice video i just bought the same machine and i m getting wet puck with a fine cut 2 2 2 any advice can you also send a link of the distribution tool 51mm michael aye are you using the portafilter that came with the machine if so i have the same problem homebaristant i got the same filter a in the video now and i do not understand it huge filter size with grind setting 5 on my virtuoso i barely can make 14 gram fit in using one go using an intermediate tamping i can squeeze about 18 gram in but then the shot is so very strong using my dark espresso roast and if i just use 14 gram the puck will be soup like any advice is there a filter size reducer available to only make single shot with this portafilter thank you wet puck are going to be a common thing on machine that do not have a three way solenoid valve a long a your puck is not soupy you should be fine if it is very soup like try increasing your dose or go finer on the grind setting hope this help edit almost forgot here is the link for the distribution tool can you show how you changed the frothing wand hello catherine if you have the same exact model a i do removing the pannarello wand is fairly simple it is a easy a turning the pannarello wand sleeve counter clockwise about 1 4 of a full rotation and you should be able to pull it down and out just be careful if you have a different delonghi model a some have much shorter rubber nozzle underneath than this one hope this help can you send a link for the bottomless portafilter and distribution tool please of course no problem the bottomless pf went up in price but this is the exact one i purchased distribution tool is that art of a but whole for an age restricted video i had high hope for a topless barista preferably female i should thumb down this video for setting me up for a big disappointment haha sorry i am just concerned about mindlessly saying or doing something that fall under the age restriction category i will try to not disappoint next time how can yours possibly push through coffee tamped that hard i have the same machine and it can not do that have you changed the basket or depressurized the original one what kind of grinder do you have how about your dosage

4,De'Longhi Stilosa Manual Espresso Machine,view on amazon con we had to read the instruction and the frother is noisy are you kidding me this channel is a joke
5,DeLonghi Stilosa EC260BK First Impressions,i did not see you remove the water tank from the back of the machine do you have another video showing how that is removed and replaced my main reason for watching your video is to see if it wa a removable water tank awesome thanks yes it ha a removable tank very nice machine here is another video sad to say it to loud tried to deal with it for a month thinking it would stop being so noisy use to have a krups for year and really miss it hi i wa wondering if you could pull a shot of hot water and take the temperature to see if it is accurate for espresso making i have a cheap espresso maker which i noticed is pulling hot water at around 145 which is not nearly a hot a required for espresso so i am considering taking it back for this one but i want to make sure about the water thanks hi can you tell the brand of the coffe grinder thanks i added the link to the description see my other video in this case i used the cusiniart grinder only con that i have to say is the noise it is normal that sound waiting for mine to arrive in the next couple day if you are a newbie like me remember that you will need a burr grinder awesome video the instruction say to do that initial rinse with a full liter 2 time but i am sure that cup you did wa plenty two cup but can not hurt to do more i would love to see a versus between the ec260bk the stilosa amp the ecm680 the dedica i have been hesitating for week between those two and i wan na know if the dedica ha more advantage than just the design and the fact that it is automatic and ha an auto stop mode and happy new year what size wa the tamper sorry i can not remember but i think it is the 53mm what size are those glass i thought espresso wa meant for around 2oz per shot at most doe this just make it a bit weaker when filling up what look to be 2x 5oz glass why the machine it is making that noise thank you for the video got one for my daughter for christmas and we were a little nervous setting it up we went step by step pausing you along the way and she just handed me the best coffee i have ever had that wa made at home thank you and merry christmas if you celebrate awesome happy holiday to you and your family glad the video helped a marche mais le caf est deguelasse amertume la cafeti re lidl faisait mieux une krups est tr s largement au dessus de ce 2 fabriquant thank you for your great video it helped me a lot i have a couple different shot glass from costco is that are from dessert but mine have no handle so my husband came home with this espresso machine for me today so i am trying to figure it out i have only ever made coffee espresso making is new to me what kind of coffee should i use can i use my same coffee i buy the big grey bag from costco is you will love this machine you will never go back to coffee lol yes definitely use lavazza who would give you a thumb down what is wrong with people you did great on this video oh wow thanks for the kind word i usually just ignore negative comment but you sure made my day excellent review thank you thank you for the review did you buy it i do not think you are supposed to ruin your coffee till you mug got full it is one ounce for a single shot and two ounce for a double i do whats he is supposed to do with the rest throw it out great demo video on this model i went to bed bath amp beyond and picked it up for the price i actually find it to be well made thanks i third the motion best coffee i also got mine from there and have been enjoying the quality and design nicely glad you found my video useful enjoy your new espresso machine what a po are you kidding me the cup are trying to walk off meanwhile the neighbor are like wtf is that noise thanks for the video i almost bought that thing phew it sound like a wood chipper that is four shot of espresso yikes i think you pulled for too long it worth spending money for real machine if i had to do this in the morning i would be late shavinmccrotch every machine vibrates and sound like if the roof is collapsing d josephine so is a bicycle i think she meant a machine that is not a slow vibrating piece of crap that sound like a wood chipper this is a real machine wake up earlier the espresso would have tasted better if you would not have pulled the shot for so long you do not need to fill the cup all the way the espresso should not be coming out white best of luck d josephine you are the one who is coming at me arguing nonsense purely for the point of arguing you do not even know what you are talking about shavinmccrotch lol sound like you are the one who need it lol someone is cranky shavinmccrotch so a dollar50 machine made le noise than this one right d josephine i obviously would not own this hunk of junk if you paid me i have had smaller machine that were better faster virtually silent and literally half the price and i wa just looking at a dollar998 machine if you must know but they are too bulky for me if i put 2 scoop into the 2 cup filter doe that make it a double shot i guess if you want to get technical 1 shot should be between 7 9 gram and 14 18 gram for a double shot yes appreciated tried mine my 1st coffee machine the other day complete fail and blew my milk all over my face and the wall  it doe take some practice congratulation thank you nice review the video is great hi there where i can get those clear glass cup what is the brand and model thank you im a nerd when it come to coffee can you make a video using this machine showing you make some latte art that would be very cool have you been to a coffee shop i would like you to compare the flavor please and thank you i want to get one of these machine forest something lol right just made sense when i saw them wow thats where i got my shot glass too lol they were actually from mousse dessert from costco they work great a espresso shot glass did yours leak at all from bottom no thank you man nice review nice presentation much appreciated

7,De'Longhi Stilosa Espresso and Cappuccino Maker Review,thanks it is very helpful everything i hoped it would be i love the simplicity of this keurig mybest kitchen i have had the old school original keurig for forever i decided to upgrade to button lol same great quality without having to measure your water this keurig doe all the thinking for you i also love not having to put water into the machine every time i want to use it simple and perfect ok so it is not cappuccino maker it is just steamer now let me tell you secret before you steam milk add one or two spoon of sugar than steam it it will make better foamy milk and last longer also using 2percent milk it is not the best in my opinion this is not a review this is a tutorial for god sake and a terrible one at that she ha no idea what she is doing i have one of these that i will be returning it is dreadful i have wasted nearly a half pound of lavazza bean on various grind setting and have yet to pull a shot that ha the strength and complexity that i can get from something a cheap and ineffective a my old krups steam powered machine carrie anne i just bought a moka pot it is quite tasty lol and take up a ton le space same husband bought this for my bday and we will be returning a well and making a big leap to the breville barista express no matter what we do the shot are so weak waisted so much coffee several brand simply trying to figure this out one reason we did not go for a nepresso is because we read the shot are weak but this machine wa such a let down tip you ha to pour milk in a stainless pitcher and make sure it is chilled before frothing yes i am a master barista is the machine a huge a the dimension say what the froth milk well it wa just milk but you really do need to get a frothing pitcher the milk will froth more and you will know the difference that wa just heat milk you are not doing it correctly very terrible just the the pitcher and try it again i had to do it like 20 time until i could get the froth really nice and even though after keep doing i still know i have more work to do because sometimes you get it and sometimes you do not i wa thinking the same when she poured it out disappointing same it take a lot of practice and tutorial to reach a decent level of good milk foam same issue the frother is basically non existent we have a smeg espresso machine with frother which is amazing we bought this delonghi for our summer home sorely disappointed with the frother it is just heated milk no foam thanks for the review it wa nice to see someone actually make a cup of the espresso for reference
8,De'Longhi Stilosa EC230.BK Review + Disassembly. Comparison with EC235 and EC260,anyone know where to buy online the original unpressurized basket that come with the ec230 to use it in the ec260  thank tou really nice video hello dmitriy i have recently purchased an ec 260 and i am having an issue with the basket getting stuck in the head of the machine it seems to be too tight when it connects and so the pin in the portafilter is not strong enough amazing video great to know the exact boiler size hey dmitriy great video bought this 2nd hand what size of grind do you recommend for this machine also ceramic or stainless steel burr doe it even matter cheer ceramic burr usually can not give fine enough grind level thus s burr would be better hi what is the size of porta filter and tamper for ec230 thanks 51 this review is very bad and the the explanation are wrong thank you for detailed feedback justin which particular explanation you find to be wrong doe it come with a milk jug no can you buy a pressurised basket for this model i am not getting any crema at all i have a good grinder and it ha done me well so far dmitriy yurchenko awesome thanks for replying man really appreciate it sure part number 7313288199 should fit i am an idiot i do not want panarello and i do not want a pressurized basked since i have a decent grinder and i got the 260 it wa on sale and i got it on impulse and now i have to mod it wish i could trade for a 230 hi which of these three machine is the best in your opinion 1 cheap gaggia like viva etc basically rebranded saeco poemas 2 delonghi ec31 3 delonghi ec230 from this review 4 ariete picasso i would like to try unpressurized filter when i buy one of these machine i mostly drink milk coffee latte and cappuccino but sometimes when i want stronger drink i drink espresso dmitriy yurchenko thanks i suspect gaggias are best because best they have quality component inside why not delonghi definitely viva poemia lol he open the machine before telling u how the shot taste  how many steam hole unpressurized basket with no panarello if u want to start ur latte making journey in hard mode i m struggling to get a good crema on this using the finest setting on my grinder it pours fast and a bit too watery any tip probably your grinder can not do grind enough for espresso which grinder do you use hi what is that manual grinder used in this video 1zpresso q1 mym54 on aliexpress they did not produce it anymore here are some photo why it is not good a a gift so ec260 is best overall can you elaborate on why you can not use coffee from the supermarket with this one and which one you can crensh i am writing 6 month later i suggest you invest in a good grinder a this is just a important a a good espresso machine i personally have a breville barista express that ha an integrated grinder in the machine and i love it i bought the machine based on the review and 2 friend that bought and recommended the quality of the machine i am a big fan dmitriy yurchenko thanks i buy lavazza oro and use french press daily for my americano i want a coffee machine but seems there is a lot to consider because prepacked ground coffee usually ha too coarse grind level on the ec230 they install single wall basket not pressurized basket which require finer grinding if you will find properly preground coffee buy it at local coffee shop for example of course you can use it

12,The Best Espresso Machines Under £100,that rubber gasket is supposedly for ese pod compatibility my delonghi also ha one and it is branded a ese ready but it never really worked properly with pod i always hate it when people try to school me on what good coffee is they never even agree with eachother and let alone with me i have the swan one and i really love it not only doe it look good like im sorry man if the 3 button make you confused they really tried with you to make it a easy a possible but it make coffee that me and my boyfriend like and a some people have frowned at me when i told that i like my coffee with milk sorry man i just love myself a good cappucino those people exist too so let u exist it just creates a really nice frothy milk and the coffee ha way more flavour than from a cupmachine which ha the same price i tried the real thing in a cafe and i always found that coffee way too strong which then force me to add way too much sugar just to soften down the bitter flavour so yeah do your own thing not all of u have killed our tasting bud due to everyday coffee drinking that we can barely taste coffee anymore and need wildly strong flavour to even taste something if you are someone thats more sophisticated with taste and look that swan one will be your happyness in the morning and remember do not be a peasant to tell other people what taste good and then go to some extreme with your yellowed coffee teeth what about gaggia viva style anyone have experience i picked up a delonghi ecp 3420 on ebay for half price dollar75 package damaged but not the unit and am very pleased with it please review the gemilai crm3605 day 3 you are absolutely hilarious and insightful what a blessing your video are on my journey to hopefully become le ignorant in the realm of espresso what is your coffee grinder i have this delongi ec156b model for alsmost 20 year back then it came with a proper portafilter non pressurized i brew every day and this poor thing it just will not break to replace it with something new but i just love the shot out of this machine use coarse grinded coffee and a i had many occasion to try other espresso machine even a lot more expensive i still prefer this old machine love the marc rebillet shirt oh i am so pretentious ariete pump espresso maker coffee powder or coffee pod can be used metal espresso coffee maker art 1381 is it any good ok now i finally understand those scene from mulholland drive could there be a mesh filter on top to prevent the channel from being made i wish u tried the milk steamer krups crap if you simply chose the delonghi because it doe not have a pressurized portafilter why did not you simply make a more beneficial helpful video by selecting better quality machine still within budget of course amp simply encourage the option of buying a non pressurized portafilter which is an easy affordable add on someone on a budget can still have access to someone really on a budget will want a decent machine decent affordable hand grinder amp will be willing to buy an additional non pressurized portafilter for a better experience yet still not break the bank this is the combo of solution you should work on to provide u with machine under at dollar100 or dollar150 max amp a hand grinder at dollar100 max non pressurized portafilter i value your assistance amp hope you will make this video thanks just a an owner of the admittedly bad krups machine is there any way to mod it in order to get even extraction or is it more worth it just to throw it out this video is the ultimate expression of a first world problem hell yeaa would a second hand machine that wa more expensive when it came out be better is the effort in finding one in good working condition while being cheaper due to age worth it you should do a yearly top 3 of each item type of item ie grinder coffee machine under certain price point i am trying to figure out grinder and although i am 90percent certain i will end up ordering a niche zero but i read watch all these niche killer video on other channel and they end up being well not very helpful like some for the eureka mignon then there is the fellow ode which you have covered a couple of time in great video it would just be nice to have something a tad more definitive could even be a table on your website great to see that james is a loop daddy fan this guy like his coffee kitchen aid espresso machine hello james found your channel just yesterday i only drink espresso or my version of i just have it a a le water version of i suppose a regular coffee in a five ounce juice glass the shot about 3 ounce of water and a spot of milk some have called it an american it is just something that i have enjoyed for many year and it is both better tasting than anything perked or dripped every now and then i will have a straight up traditional shot with a spot of milk not into that froth stuff i have an ever changing bar a far a the coffee i use mostly bean ground at or near time of use but i mix many style of bean and sometimes some preground mixed with the ground bean coffee like offering from lavazza for example for variation to varying effect some good some not so but nothing is ever perfect i have a crusinart burr grinder model dbm 8c and a crusinart espresso maker model em 100c have had them both for year and both have been from coast to coast to coast in canada in my truck exploring the country and served very well on those trip at family get togethers and at home probably around 25000 espresso from the one machine so far in at least a decade great value for the cost it wa around 180dollar canadian it is a pressured portafilter i thought they all were but you say not i drink a lot of coffee the only addiction i have the drink went in 1987 the smoke went in 2000 but the coffee remains coffee seems to get people talking and it is the second most valuable legally traded commodity on the planet behind oil that is an amazing statistic tagged to coffee thank you james cheer rick armstrong aurora ontario canada i have the swan retro under the brand of arielli do you think by upgrading the basket to a non pressurised and having a decent grinder could result to major improvement and getting a decent tamper also honestly james you should drink le coffee it really affecting your voice by making it more coarse i compared your voice in this video to video you posted 2 year ago bought the delonghi a my first coffee machine in my first own flat used capsule previously it wa on sale and costed about 80 euro back then i wa amazed to see that it still worked fine after 3 to 4 year of use however i recently upgraded for a sage which no surprise is by far better try instant coffee it the best i will stick to my moka pot and french press can you please review gevi machine i got one for dollar200 and i am trying to figure it out i am new lol i have amazon basic under the brand starlight and it my coffee machine from 2012 and i really enjoy the coffee it produce james i have only just found your channel but really enjoy it already your video on how to make proper frothed milk ha improved my froth overnight however i must tell you that 99percent of average people will be buying precisely these machine if they are at all interested in better coffee very few people will ever dream of spending more than gbp100 on a coffee machine even 100 seems too expensive i discovered great coffee on an italian holiday and when back home bought a mokka pot to try and emulate that compared to instant coffee it wa light year better and it only cost gbp5 after a few year i saw a delonghi espresso machine and it looked so pretty i bought a refurbished one that lasted me about 3 4 year and wa another step up from the mokka pot i make exclusively cappuccino it produced the same result a the delonghi in this video i assumed this wa the pinnacle of coffee making when it packed up i bought another gbp100 delonghi which packed up last week after 5 6 year of use not having seen your video i replaced it with what i could afford a euros100 sencor espresso machine just because i wa tired of the noise and incessant dripping of the delonghi like most people i simply do not have euros500 to spend on a coffee machine or euros100 on a grinder gbp30 for the grinder which is actually a nut grinder i say all this to help you realise that most likely 99percent of your subscriber are like me so please keep that in mind when making your video i do wish manufacturer would give u real espresso machine for euros100 since that is alot of money just to make coffee and it is downright terrible of them to offer a sub par experience to an unwitting public who think they are now getting coffee shop quality at home this is fever dream shit we cuban have been making expressor coffee for decade with cheap expresso machine paying more than dollar 30 it is just for the look thanks for the review this wa very helpful not sure if you will see this comment but i would love to see you do a review of the new chefman 6 and 1 expresso maker i have seen a ton of review from just regular people and i never trust anybody but you well that is very helpful i wa thinking about swan machine but i saw review and people say the coffee taste like plastic is that right you get a power light that never go on and a heating light that never go off lol really what a company deja brew hehe hehe that made me giggle i will get my coat i could not sleep the other night and i wa browsing some used thing online found used old espresso machine for 10dollar delonghi good condition they were selling because they bought a newer more expensive one i cleaned it descaled it and now every morning i am enjoying a nice shot of espresso today i rewatched this video and realized that my delongi is the delongi from the video feel good why is no one commenting on dejabrew i had such a good giggle i have and use the amazon basic espresso machine although it doe not look like the one you have on this video but same function i have been using it for about a year and i love it to me it a much le wasteful drip coffee maker i wa tempted on the delonghi but went for an aeropress instead by putting limited boiling water and 2 scoop of fine grind powder i can pull a basic crema on my aeropress good one james have you found a good espresso machine not for million i am tempted by delonghi but willing to add gbp100 more cheer i am guessing if i am not rich i can not drink coffee at home every machine you try is just full of negative comment i totally get it you are very into coffee and i am sure more educated than most people and can tell many other difference that we can or at least me love your channel is incredible the amount of knowledge but honestly dunno if i want to drink coffee anymore at home i have the feeling i am drinking liquid shit do i pas the test if i make moka coffee following your tutorial any one else spotted the marc rebillet t shirt come to islam n success amazon sell a 4 bar espresso machine von shef for gbp54 and robert dyas sell a similar looking 5 bar machine salter for gbp35 ideal for any coffee lover i am fascinated and would love to see a review of one of these not really espresso machine i will stick to my bialetti but it wa an interesting test who in the wild west could afford to do this however i wa once invited here in winnipeg a loooong time ago to an ethiopian coffee ceremony where a woman roasted many coffee bean in a pan and then tossed them into a rolling boil of a hot pot of water where they seemed to explode before getting immediately covered with some large green leaf which i seem to remember a being pointed though what is really pointed ha to do with how unexpectedy thoroughly shockingly and subversively complete it wa in it is flavour i have bought the same model machine a the amazon one yes they are all cheap chinese oem for 24dollar for the price it is great for everyday milk drink but i would not recommend paying more than 25dollar for it i beg to disagree i used a delonghi for about 10 year the machine is very reliable very simple to operate and no fuss yes coffee is inconsistent but i love the randomness of it and yes it doe an ok espresso and from time to time you get lucky and you get a great espresso for the price and simplicity there is nothing a great at this just bought silvercrest espresso machine today from lidl for gbp49 99 why spend dollar100 or so for an electric espresso machine when you could instead spend a little le money for a cafflano kompresso espresso maker i would like to see mr hoffman do a comparison between say the delonghi and the kompresso and share his thought precision consistency and control thats not the impression i got after watching the 1 500 pound video amazing how the same coffee can taste different according to how you brew the coffee the shirt me oh look thats the machine i bought it make decent coffee i am loving it james this espresso machine is awful the espresso it make taste disgusting it make me sad me oh this fella would pas out if someone offered him a three in one coffee stick i just picked up a silvercrest espresso machine from lidl for euros60 along with a euros13 grinder the only inconvenience being that i have to hand hold a consistently a possible at every step to make sure a lot of stuff is being done a well a can be doe it make perfect espresso not by a long shot but with a bit of effort i can make a pretty good cup 80percent of the time for euros60 it is honestly been worth it for the learning experience alone and honestly the coffee is just a good a it is from most standard coffeeshops so yeah probably sub par i will probably keep at it for a year or two before selling it on and upgrading i think your krups is defective mine doe not disperse water like that i just stick to instant coffe the delonghi wa the machine i came into coffee with i modified the portafilter and used a basket from another delonghi model and managed good espresso from it before grabbing a rancilio silvia and mazzer mini electronic now looking for another upgrade 8 49 wrap up 9 17 the answer is no i wa looking on amazon and i found one breville all in one from the review there is seems like the machine ha alot of issue can you review it 5 29 i did not but thanks anyways i know this video is old james but could you teach u how to improve our espresso in cheaper machine i know you want u to save our money and buy a better machine but it ai not gon na happen i am okay with good espresso and not great espresso because i would not be able to taste the difference anyway please you could get good result with any one of these machine with a bottomless portafilter and a distribution screen to place on top of the puck most of these cheap machine use a 51mm basket there used to be this machine that would help you make nespressor pod at home in a metal filter basket i can not find it for the life of me i love my office is nespresso it is small easy to manage and easy to clean everything else ha just felt big and clunky hi james just bought the salter 3 in 1 barista deluxe have you done a review on this thanks ah rocking a marc rebillet shirt a man of culture and taste my dream machine is the izzo myway alex duetto iv plus beautiful my friend dad bought to celebrate his promotion i have never been more jealous my sad evil villain backstory another top video james what grinder do you use doe he have a video on how to hack and make a passable espresso with a cheap machine setup i am literally just getting into this my wife got me a capresso maker and a spice coffee grinder for xmas i am really not a fan of regular drip coffee most time this thing is pretty good for me at the very least i feel like i am making something more akin to a very bold spanish coffee with all the sweet taste i like and none of the bitter of drip coffee i can not stand idk if i would call it an espresso or cappuccino though lol i would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction for an absolute entry level novice please and thank you well i d assume to get something brewing reasonably close to an espresso like coffee with that money one would just skip all the cheap non sustainable electric appliance once and for all james talked about their reliability durability only implicitly and go for a wacaco picopresso etc instead this one you could a well use offroad outdoors where and when nothing else wa in reach anyway and you may have spare for decent therno cup even if you want something like espresso and really do not have more than 100 buck im doing the math in euro so the budget is even tighter than in pound go for a timemore c c2 a 4 6 cup moka pot two bag of good coffee and one bag of not so great coffee to figure out how to use all that what do you think of buono espresso maker buo 265001 is there such a thing a tell tale sign of the quality of the coffee i will be getting if the construction hit a certain criterion i have come back to this video and realised you are wearing a marc rebillet t shirt this guy already got his mind made up that these machine are trash the old krups cheaper end machine were great they dispersed water nicely did not have the pressurised basket and ran very clean by which i mean almost zero coffee grind would end up on the shower i could have cried when mine broke about 2006 7 it wa already a second hand machine such a work horse i went out and got the latest cheapest krups budget restriction thinking it would be a solid game plan but ended up using a filter cone and paper a the drippy nonsense the modern krups made wa not worth the effort i now have a genericshire mocha pot but hanker after a cheap espresso machine with a plain steam wand why do some cheaper machine insist on putting plastic cap on them so that i can make up some fancy coffee a a treat problem is that most current espresso machine appear to have gone all in on istyle and the pod system which is no use to me hope something come up in the sale bummer about the krups i know they are just made in china now but i have had good luck with their other appliance currently have a toaster from them thats really nice for the price i wa using delonghi like this for a while it can be helped from vibration and noise a little by the smarter arrangement of line between pump and boiler so they do not touch the body also it ha solid user following for praise and modification however i ended for now on arietta miro that wa here for the price of 59 99 eur quite a goodie my arietta a others of their entry model ha brittle plastic for portafilter handle with an ending screen inserted in the way it start to crack handle while yet on display at retail most disappointing mishap machine itself however is very nice baby with normal lockable basket silicone cappucino insert for crema included which work nearly a pressurized basked doe it is quite enjoyable to master this little thingie to decent result great video what about the neo flair i am sure i have seen the bottom of the range machine for le than gbp100 which coffee grounder did you use shoutout to marc rebillet useful i have that exact delonghi machine but did not pay 100 quid for it i bought it from a cash converter for 15 pound and it a you say okay looking to upgrade now though what grinder are you using pitty the livivo wa not covered little disappointed to find out the delonghi ec146b doe not seem to be available anymore and most of the newer model all appear to come with pressurized portafilters now and even with the rubber ring inside the cup why tf are 90percent of comment de longhi this de longhi that i had to do a double take at the t shirt a man of culture i see this is how to do review honest highly attentive to every detail and almost snobbishly picky i am surprised the amazon basic machine is that bad basic is generally pretty okay you should review the terra karraffe not me watching the 4th review of espresso machine even though i actually hate espresso delonghi 3120 is about dollar120 or so it make a good cup of brew outside of that cost your looking at dollar600 plus for a better machine not everyone is going to want drop that much for a coffee maker james you are hilarious and very knowledgeable i love your content please continue to make your video how long doe this coffee machine last please month year 1 41 i have changed my mind of buying one thanks do you have a video that show the cheapest machine you would use and that is show why you like it the only think i got out of this video wa at 3 34 in the video you said it come with a proper basket when your looking a basket how do you know what a proper basket look like from the others do you have a video that you go over what is needed to make the espresso a video for people that are new to this in this video you keep going over thing that wa not good but you did not say what wa needed you said at 4 08 there wa no gauge if there wa a gauge what would you want to see the pressure or the temp of the water or both is the amount of pressure the water is being pressed out into the basket important if so what psi do you want i have a steamer and it ha a pressure regulator switch in it i can turn the adjustable screw on the top of the switch to set the pressure of steam that come out there is a pipe that go from the tank to a pressure gauge so it not a big deal to add a pressure gauge and a adjustable pressure switch when the pressure i set is reached it shuts off the power to the heater that go around tank i guess when i am controlling the pressure in the tank i am controlling the temp of the water so i guess what i would like to know is what is more important in making good espresso the pressure it coming out or the temp of the water or both what is the magic pressure or temp wanted at 9 03 you said the delonghi doe not have a pressurized portafilter but you did not say what system the delonghu us what should we be looking for do a you have a link to the bare minimum espresso video your were talking about making hi james i am not a hobbyist barista or anything but i know good coffee from a lot of time spent in italy france and other part of the world where i have encountered real espresso that wa glorious i only have a 70 quid john lewis espresso pump machine but regarding your mention of pressurised basket my portafilter setup is pretty much the same a on the swan machine you look at first and others with that extra plastic filter screwed to the bottom so following your video i tried removing that additional plastic filter but it made the coffee taste revolting every time however i ground and packed it with it on the difference is night and day the machine certainly doe not make stellar espresso but it make a damn good one for the price it just take a little playing around with grind size and packing grind size absolutely make a huge difference even with this pressurised basket and a perfectly respectable cup of espresso can be made with good flavour when you are mixing it with frothed milk etc it is completely adequate for a nice cup so if my espresso machine came with a pressurized basket could i buy proper basket to replace it i use moka pot or aluminum french press and go to coffe shop for a decent espresso the amount of money i would need to spend is not worth just having it at home serving two people in the long run good info and demo on these machine i am just wondering why you did not demonstrate the steamer insanely unpleasant man i have a machine like the swan but with a different name all the part including the basket and sexy tapper are the same i am no expert i used to use nespresso machine including a vertuo next i do like the espresso i am getting from my machine much more than the nespresso stuff i use various preground italian espresso like lavazza creama i gusto and some from segafredo and those taste good to me the best preground are the one that look dark and have a soft feeling when i tap down i know i do not know shit about espresso and have probably never tasted the gold standard so i am happy and satisfied when he dropped that cup thing from that holder thing i wa expecting to hear a loud and annoying cling and then he robbed me of that experience by muting out the sound i want my cling hoffman give me the cling untempted you thought i would say deja brew but i did not because i do not hate you or me best line i think anyone it better than instant coffee i get one of them and i just use spensive bean and flavour it great i do love the look of the swan retro hope if performs well 7 43 james hoffmann at his best james hoffmann is all the good thing about british people yet somehow none of the bad thanks for the video very good explenation so far i use caffitally capsule wich brings the creamy foam the strong coffe taste without much acidic taste but is not eco friendly and cost efective and reusing the capsule make not good coffe i am looking to by an espresso cuz i love how my father grinded the bean and the taste wa the same coffe to coffe but do not want to spend to much just for coffe machine im not that addicted for the perfect result amazon literally copied another kid is wrong answer on the test i am going to buy the delonghi i do not have the money to be a coffee hobbyist i just want coffee slightly above the quality of my mr coffee maybe quality is not the right word i want stronger tasting coffee with more punch and i can not afford to go to a coffee shop twice a day and spend dollar12 14 how old is this guy it like mr rogers when he wa in his 30 please remake this for people who can not afford the expensive shit what should i actually buy all of these apparently make terrible tasting coffee should i stick to aeropress so we did formerly own the delonghi my partner had started working at a large coffee chain a a barista whilst saving up to pay for her master degree and i wa a phd student so budget were tight but she cared enough to want to practice her coffee at home and make espresso and latte we did get some ok coffee out of it despite a horrible cheap grinder or preground but it proved to be quite frustrating and fiddly so eventually we stopped using it and it went to the charity shop i would not recommend it pity swan do not make a dolce gusto machine co they all look a bit cack tbh id buy one if they looked like this swan retro swan retro owner here mine ha another name it is the same cheap asian product which sold under various brand name i have drilled out the pressure thingy which leaf me with a regular portafilter it hole are pretty big though which make it tough to have good pressure this modification alone improved the espresso by a lot given that i have a decent grinder and good coffee bean also a good third party tamper is pretty much needed overall the espresso is not great but good enough and much better than one might expect at that price point you get uncomfortable really quickly do not criticize thing just because they are cheap which delonghi is this the link doe not specify thing is what taste poor to james is perfectly nice for about 99percent of the population it is like being a wine connoisseur you end up ruining cheap wine for yourself bruh my old machine wa like a combo of all the bad stuff of these one pinprick hole terrible knob no dial single temperature bitter acid like coffee weird spout design aggressive water rattle loud made entirely out of plastic and cost dollar180 i have switched to the breville barista express and it is 100percent better if you drink milk drink espresso every morning or at least every few morning i suggest making the investment with good care it will last for quite a while 5 30 but you did say it if you are just listening to the video he sound like winnie pooh and it is kind of amazing oh man why on earth wa there a tim horton is advert in the middle of this review i bought sort of an expresso machine like those and i am quite satisfied when compared to instant coffee or coffee made with drip machine it taste the hell better also this allowed me to get into this coffee world learn something new every day and i will buy a better machine thanks for sharing your knowledge i do not want rubber in my brewing environment said my wife and now we have 2 kid i wan na see a james hoffman and marc rebillet collaboration imagine lood daddy making song about espresso with sample from james delightful review can you review the delonghi stilosa absolute espresso snowflake 100percent agree what is the grinder in the video thanks for all the video i just bumped into this channel yesterday and i can not stop watching it learning a lot and feeling fool for considering my coffee accessory they were good just by being manual despite being cheap cheer these machine are made for hotel with terrible customer big thanks james before i saw this video from other research id done i chose the delonghi thanks to a trip to italy i became a dedicated albeit beginner espresso drinker who never really drank anykind of coffee before your review of the delonghi wa spot on all the little deets true whether it the bean or the grind i have a basic cuisinart or a little of everything i can definitely taste the difference between my little beginner machine and an espresso pulled from an dollar8 000 lamarzocco it good at best and acceptable at worse imho im ready to move up to a better machine keeping the budget lt dollar500 w i pull an espresso 5x better than my novice machine or 2 3x better a experienced outside and will follow you accordingly thanx again what scale used in video great grinder cheap machine exactly what i want to learn and they all suck honest review love it thanks you can not call a video best budget espresso machine and then proceed to just slag them all off most people come here for a bit of insight on what they can afford and then just watch 10 minute of a man shitting on the ability of a machine should be aman slag off espresso machine most reasonable people can afford true it is better to take a flair espresso than that machine funny everyone raf about the swan machine so i just bought one the secret to good expresso is in the preparation i will let you know how i get on with the swan very handy i am in the market for a machine and have ruled out these doe anyone have experience with solac or klarstein espresso machine i have learnt so much through you james thank you so much love your video so much real unbias opinion are hard to find on youtube i am swinging between a rocket apartmento or a breville double boiler i am a novice but do not want to waste time on the lower end machine lelit might be another brand in that price range that could be interesting if you like the e61 group head style of the rocket the marax is also an hx machine but it ha some cleverness to help work around the issue james did a video machine under gbp1500 covering both the rocket apartamento the lelit marax and then breville dual boiler by the way if you do not mind not having the e61 group head style the lelit elizabeth is a slightly better performing dual boiler type machine similar or maybe even a little bit better than the breville dual boiler but with a different styling which can be more pleasing to some thick metal casing for example good luck in your search i hope you find the right machine for you and enjoy it the breville dual boiler is a lot of machine for the money there is some better machine out there but they are much much more expensive the apartamento is not a bad machine but it is a heat exchanger hx type machine which is a way to get almost a good result a a dual boiler type machine at a lower cost the issue are lower temperature stability needing to flush before pulling a shot on most hx machine and not all can steam while pulling a shot the way a dual boiler can a closer equivalent to the breville dual boiler might be the rocket r58 but that machine is about twice the price and will not outperform the breville broadly speaking i have an inexpensive coffee grinder and the longer i grind the finer the coffee is so what is the deal for spending more money on a grinder excellent vid thanks for making thank you for this late night impulse purchase hit hard on me really really thank you i will just hold on to my v60 and origami for now taking control is in fact a priority i never thought watching someone talk about coffee machine would be this interesting xd any thought about the gaggia viva anyone how would it compare to these thank you for making a video for poor people much respect subscribed keep up the good work i never knew coffee could be so interested tha k you for sharing with u the gordon ramsay of coffee with gbp100 i would get a moka pot and a grinder loop daddy x coffee papa collab when james fine is excellent for my tongue have u tried petrus coffee machine what is the mein conclusion which one do you would choose can you do a video manual v automatic machine this video should be called do not buy an espresso machine for under 100 quid they all suck i have bought the wmf lumero a bad mistake because it also doe not spray hot water evenly on the coffee surface and make this giant hole that you talk about you can even hear the channel going through my ascaso dream machinr give bad coffee why i have a beko espresso machine which i paid gbp40 for it make a great cup of coffee the price ha gone up to gbp65 now though late night impulse purchase cough i wa lucky enough to wake up to discover some variant of the delonghi machine headed my way but i can not claim to have made that choice on purpose i agree about the machine mounted tamper i am already having issue with that but i am enjoying the experimentation i would hardly call my attempt so far good but even my initial fumbling attempt have already made the nespresso pod available at my workplace barely palatable by comparison so i am not complaining i just love it when people are this honest it s a review that s what we want to see thank you sir have you by any chance reviewed the ariete 1389 vintage expresso machine what model wa the delonghi i really wish i could taste the coffee that make you bend over in pain back to back with the coffee that make you nod with approval would i taste the difference so how about full automatic coffee machine like the philip lattego series or siemens eq s800 for example are we sacrificing quality for the ease of use oh my i have just realized who is merch you are wearing and it blew my mind i have used the de longhi machine for about five year every day the review wa pretty close i used illy expresso blend and heat it on the milk setting it tends to give a hotter pull ok expresso but not great it is durable and ha held up best espresso machine at 100 is the hamilton beach one i would put that up against any 500 dollar machine thanks jeff killed me what do you think about anza coffee machine james hoffman it is okay me go and buy it the whole machine actually just bend that wa beautiful james broadly unpleasant hehehe love your vocab thanks for doing this science for u would the coffee be better with a non presurized portafilter please could you suggest me what coffee machine to go for my budget max gbp500 please help it wa really very informative an useful video that should definitely help people who want to buy a coffee machine thank youuu i use a hand held travel expresso this ha a leak in the pressure pump boiling your water first i am also a construction worker electrician i have to be at the job site at 5 30 in the morning i have an electric battery back up on to heat the water it is a quality product in the filtration system is it is good i just enjoy my espresso in the morning or a break and i do a good job at work and my friend smoke weed in the morning but i appreciate not buying a garbage machine thank you god you are so pretentious not at all you just lack the ability to differentiate between passion and pretentiousness thats a you problem lmao fine but a bit dull my reason i did not buy a cheap machine right now i am sticking with my gb moka and learning to perfect it after using it wrong for 10 year but if i wa to buy a machine i am leaning towards the gaggia classic pro thanks for comparison awesome work mr hoffman someone just gave me their de longhi caffee rialto and it ha the same problem a most of these machine dig a channel the puck look like mud no crema do not even attempt to use the steam wand it just shoot out hot water like an evil super soaker i accept that after a year it is unlikely that anyone will see this comment but here it go when you say if you are willing to put in the work you can get decent espresso out of this machine exactly what do you mean how doe one do that here is a possible solution buy 4 of these cheapo espresso machine and you can use them a foot for a la marzocco gs3 how many of you would like to see a video about which espresso machine can at minimum produce a starbucks quality shot for at home espresso drink even with all these video i have no idea what to purchase i do not want this to be a side hobby but i will do what i got ta do to stop giving money to starbucks what is the grinder i would not enjoy having coffee with him and i wouldnt enjoy having coffee with you i actually bought the delonghi one to try out espresso glad to see it is the best out of the cheap one looking to invest in a better one in the future please can you review lidl is silvercrest 1100 espresso machine still waiting on a pixar movie about a charming but broadly unpleasant tamper scoop can you do a blind test coffee will be service and got to guess if it is from the cheap espresso machine or not when james talk about pre ground coffee or grocery store pre ground coffee doe anyone know if he is referring to preground espresso that come in the tin or is he talking about actual non espresso ground coffee bean in the bag curious a i am looking into buying a moka pot and want to know if i also need a good grinder what do you mean by in tin instant no actual ground coffee bean condolence for those who have krups 6 19 i found the delonghi machine in this vid at a thrift store for audollar5 and for that it make great audollar5 coffee i grind my bean in a kitchen blender it is a beastly little machine and only used for coffee 8 second for a fine grind for the delonghi 5 second for a coarser grind for the plunger yes i am a heathen lol tomeccho hah i loved covid got to work from home a software dev it wa best two year lol plus i got pay increase so i gave a shot to new hobby and i love the ritual of making espresso peter vansan daym i would have to start an onlyfans to afford one of those i love my coffee and that luscious crema but oh hell no covid and that associated b hit some of u hard lol life is all about minimalisation right now did i just make up a word go me tomeccho damn d i am happy with sage dose control pro 200dollar grinder for my espresso need with gaggia classic pro because where there is a will and no eff you money for expensive coffee grinder there is always a way just why what about the gazzia gran deluxe an awful lot of plastic but would it be better than these he would probably turn his nose up at it a well a that also ha a pressurised portafilter however i have one or at least one of the variant and i think it make really nice coffee and it is from a well known and respected manufacturer in this field fucking bezos please could you review the breville sage barista max just ok for him it 11 10 for is mear mortal could you review the x bar you can remove the tamper from the machine to use i have used it like what you did in the video for 2 year lol is this one good your definitely qualified to ass the coffee is quality is with your feature benefit i would not be able to detect hollow taste from full body and yea them tamper are not enjoyable idk why but i hate that part i bought a combo delongi and 90 day it broken with a problem that i can not find a remedy for in a ocean of other complaint it steam off the water before the coffee pot make 2 cup adam what his preference are should not even come into it if you start with good quality freshly ground coffee quite frankly it is b to suggest it is not good coffee because it came out of a pressurised portafilter maybe it is technically not a good a from a non pressurised but suggest that it is no good at all is total nonsense what exactly is the point of this video answer me that because i got very little from it and i like his other video other than that he ha a dislike for pressurised portafilters the one chance he had to give some real info with the first sample he did not tell u anything informative at all graham west the thing is taste is subjective but his preference is for high quality coffee because that is the whole point of this channel pressurized portafilters do not produce good coffee they just do not if you think they do it is because you have low standard of what good coffee is adam in what way is coffee not real just because it is been produced by a pressurised portafilter you do not seem to understand what a review is with a review you are supposed to come at it from an unbiased and neutral perspective by coming at this already having decided that they were no good because they use pressurised postfilters despite the coffee that is actually being produced make the whole thing a complete waste of time and quite honestly he should not have bothered graham west he didnt miss the point at all you did this channel is about real coffee not what normal people think good coffee is he is simply judging them fairly the trouble is i get the impression that he came into this with the preconceived attitude that he wa not going to like them complaining about minor issue with build quality what do you expect for this price moaning about coming with a pressurised portafilter missing the point that these are aimed at people who just want to make a coffee not faff around for half an hour trying to dial in grind size with an expensive grinder they are most certainly not aimed at mr i like perfection in my coffee and these are not delivering this is the type of machine i bought and got me into making expresos at home good news i can make even better coffee with a better machine bad news i just had someone telling me for 10 minute that my machine suck ball great review but if any of you have the krups one unfortunately i have i had the exact same issue i did this fix here youtube com watch v jbrndtjnzvw and omg i can drink coffee now wow never would have guessed you like mark rebillet the delonghi is something i have on my desk at work and outside of the first month i had it it is been very consistent it doe not make a stellar shot of espresso but it is good and head and shoulder better than starbucks and the money it is saved me from having to buy espresso from a coffee shop ha more than made up for it price that said i did buy mine on sale for dollar69 99 roughly 2 year ago i had one a well wa fine for about 1 year then the quality of the coffee dropped significan notly and after 6 12 month it kinda exploded with steam going everywhere so i threw it out it is the marc rebillet shirt for me jordan shlanski irl hey andrew james is my name what impact would a metal shower screen have on the poor channeling machine cheap espresso machine are cheap if you are tempted to go that route get a moka pot if that shape make you uncomfortable you are doing the wrong thing with it marc rebillet quarantine tour if one ha one of those crappy water jetting machine is there something like a mesh on top that can help 100 punds is 141 61 u dollar btw my delonghi 146b ha finally started to die due to corrosion around the heating element i like the coffee it is been making me for almost 11 year i am scarred badly by the jura brand i ever owned the impressa series can not remember the exact model but it wa not cheap to begin with grinder is problematic often get jam issue a it is very sensitive to the type of bean being used bean can not be oily or the shiny type and can not be too hard all these will cause jamming so i tried using coffee powder alternative which also cause jamming i do suspect the design of the grinder and their choice of material used is seriously inferior the sensor touch menu look cool but it also presented many problem such a not being able to detect touch and menu hanging had the jura staff back several time until they can no longer service my machine for free for something which is not my fault after le than a year i wa so damn frustrated with this jura machine that i literally threw the stupid machine out of my house please people do not buy jura swiss brand but china quality i love watching all of your video but i think i will give up finding a good espresso for home it would be nice to have one affordable because the nearest coffee shop to me is over an hour away but most affordable machine are just cheap and i refuse to drink nasty espresso your video are very good and i love all the information you give warning my coffee journey started with a krups gbp90 a year later i upgraded to an isomac venus gbp500 never happy two year later i purchased rocket giotto gbp1k eleven year later i have not looked back que marca e tu molino de cafe 1 pressurized portafilter can be changed did that on mine already 2 pressure controll could be modded in maybe 3 temp controll could be done i guess 4 what else would one wish for i found the delonghi machine at goodwill and covered in grime for dollar4 after cleaning it up it work pretty well considering hand down my biggest frustration are the mounted tamper and the weirdly positioned basket which doe not make for good knocking of puck would i spend gbp99 on it absolutely not is it worth the dollar4 i spent absolutely will i be buying a better machine in time 100percent lol sitting here drinking regular coffee from my dollar10 mr coffee pot this must be the single most hipster video on the internet i love it i want this candy as to fight a bear and squid in the ocean then do a blind test with crap and expensive machine if he get is it wrong he get cained in malaysia hey i have the delonghi machine and struggle to even get any crema i am using pre ground espresso from a local roaster argghh i need a step by step for how to tamp and steam are you ever gon na make that video for the bare minimum you need for good espresso 6 40 i love how elegantly disgusted he wa putting it simply this guy is annoying not including these machine which machine would make the best result for the minimal price point that video would be the most helpful i watch this on a rainy night give me the most comfortable feeling you could imagine i had that delonghi before slightly older model although only difference i could see wa that my basket wa with rubber seal and driptray cover wa from metal it cost 79euros i sold it recently because it wa just annoying to make anything indeed it wa noisy and my cup moved around on that metal driptray when it wa vibrating also when i wanted to make cappuccino the gap wa too small to put any decent cappuccino there so i had to pour from smaller cup just purely from preparation experience it wa terrible never again maybe you may try ferrati ferro ecm 3605 unpresurise basket 58mm portafilter for price about 150 pound what is the name of the grinder machine you are using broadly unpleasant love it thank you very much for making this video a little late in the day and i have seen this video before but i have watched it again at an oppurtune moment yes i wa looking to buy a cheap machine now i am not i suspect from what i have heard that my present machine is also not good enough but it suffices for now but i shall save some more money and get a better one what coffee is your most enjoyable i am a pheasant mine cost gbp50 and it is rubbish from aldi and i have seen your aldi one lol awesome video bud the main coffee man when i wa a student i inhereted an older model of that delonghi from someone who did not want it any more i had no idea what it wa worth or much of anything about coffee machine at the time i wa a french press and electric blade grinder user i used to make crap espresso with it and terrible attempt at latte art but it wa good fun and i learnt the bare bone basic of pulling shot a bit later i got a cafe gig and did some barista training and found out all that i did not know i am not sure what ever happened to it in the end this had given me a hit of nostalgia and pride in my terrible little delonghi these machine will put you off making espresso at home i have a dollar250 dehlonghi and it make ok latte for my wife but it make crap espresso and i really do not want to use it a crap machine will kill your desire what is the best home machine and best grinder i hope to holy god i never have to make you a coffee man you should start a cafe with all the patreon money i have a similar machine like those but i wonder how to get the amount of water needed for an espresso in the usual time of 25 30 in this range of time i get half a cup way too much for a small espresso even if i use 2 espresso cup i bought the delonghi twice the first one i used for year until it broke and the second one i eventually replaced with a more time convenient method i learned to get get okay espresso by watching video and practice i have always had a limited budget and i wanted to make espresso a inexpensively a i could instead of spending all my money at coffee house i am considering going back to this delonghi machine because it wa an easy machine to maintain and i do not have a quality experience to compare it to so i wa used to having to hold the machine while removing the filter and live with it is other cheap quirk i bought a real tamper instead of using that weird attached one which also helped for true espresso under gbp100 indeed not happening meanwhile im over here having grown up with dollar50 latte cappuccino maker that probably make worse espresso still enjoyable to use and thankfully not a pressurized filter i do need an under 200 or even 250 so i can catch it while in offer thanks how is that grinder called niche zero grinder i think lmao if you look at the review for these machine people are calling them amazing what grinder he is using would like to see your thought on the lavazza mio moda line pod machine be interesting to see how well a pod will compare to a grind in term of freshness etc so basically the winner of this contest is still the bialetti moka express lol no james it is hollow empty sour and butte me that is my ex lmao i appreciate this man is honesty but to be honest i am bothered by this man is honesty speaking a someone who just one one of these thankfully it wa one of the one that did not get the full brunt of his disdain redfishcarolina which one wa it graham west no actually everything it brewed tasted like cigarette ash and i am not kidding i wasted nearly a pound of lavazza that otherwise tasted great in my old steam powered machine i returned it are you happy with it that is the important part the trouble is this video appears to have been made from the perspective of i am a man who like perfection in my coffee and these are not delivering it coffee people are so pretentious your voice really make me angry but u clearly know what ur on about oh my god the marc rebillet shirt this is exactly what happened with the argo machine for gbp50 gbp60 range a hot mess awesome review a always i know this video is old james but i suggest to you adding a quick shot of the machine after the review in your newer video when you say the machine is good it prompt the viewer myself in this case to look on the internet for the name and model for buying purpose and that is almost always at the end maybe middle of the review a i know you are very well versed in video production i thought it would be a good insight if do not you already know that thanks i owned a delongi espresso machine age ago the sound of that delongi pump take me back a lot like the one you tested it made pretty good espresso when you did everything exactly right but it wa terribly fussy to do so maybe one cup in 4 wa good it wa particularly sensitive to the grind which wa not good in a time before burr grinder were affordable great video james thank you for doing this and it saved me from that impulse purchase for an espresso machine that will probably end up in the cabinet looking at the flair instead now what make is the grinder james and have you ever tested the rancillio silvia i have had it for year and only drink cappuccino but we are happy with it hi james id love to see what do you think about the gaggia ri8423 12 here in germany you can find it in amazon new for 100euros but most of the time you can buy a new used one also from amazon for 35euros and i did buy it and i have done what for me is good coffee i would still like to see what is your opinion please make a good coffee making guide for the broke 100 pound is expensive in my opinion is there anything that jh like xd speak louder 2 33 the only good shot that were shot were the camera shot spot on in term of the weird design of the delonghi machine collecting crud and on the older version of this i have it need hand cleaning to avoid build up and it is noisy and you need to know it is weird little way but with a good grinder and my limited palette we have been happy for some year oh and a tamper that is not attached because wtf this guy is such a bellend do they make a screen aftermarket that could sit between the puck and the group head to stop that flow issue what i got from this wa coffee snob think cheap widely affordable made for common espresso drinker machine are rubbish crap and make disgusting espresso so you should buy gbp400 500 machine for one type of drink i have that swan but from a different brand i never make shot but normal coffee and it is just fine i am pleased with it considering i only paid about 70 for it drip a lot when it is heating up though and the noise omfg dayum bruh i thought i wa a coffee snob this guy walking in would be evey coffee shop worker is worst nightmare food dollar200 data dollar150 rent dollar800 espresso stuff dollar30 600 utility dollar150 someone who is good at the economy please help me budget this my family is dying i think you have just got a thing about expensive machine you complain too much about stuf that do not really matter when you are american and you are confused on why he is listing how each one of them are heavy by the pound good thing i watched this video i wa just thinking of buying an espresso machine myself i am feeling guilty that i bought a gbp50 cookworks machine to make latte now my gbp50 argo one wa better than that gbp200 aldi one you showed bit trial and error at first but make a really good latte i bought the krups calvi for 130euros a an experimental secondary espresso machine to my bezzera magica and i surprisingly have to admit i tend to keep going for the krups because i do not have to wait for it to heat up especially since my magica broke i only started missing it after a year my krups make good enough espresso that it feel rewarding to make one and that is enough for me most of the time can you get good espresso from a cheap machine no you can not but you can not get it from an expensive machine why because espresso suck cowboy the f up and make some real coffee so you can move on with your life i have had for the last decade or so various iteration of the dollar100 delonghi i know there are way better machine out there for a lot more money but for the level of espresso drinker i am they have served me well one day i may upgrade but it is lower down on the list of thing i want to throw money at the problem with this kind of machine work half a year unrepairable then you will have another piece of bulky unrecyclable rubbish after going through two of them i just went with a bialetti since paying hundred doe not seem worth for an occasional coffee i have a de longhi ecp 3121 machine and i am totally satisfied with the result but it milk frother is awful can you review smeg espresso machine ok i think i might quit drinking coffee now surely the next video is best home coffee machine no max price limit another caffein addict not accepting his addiction nothing more there is no such thing a good or bad coffee we all just drink that stuff to get caffein why am i watching this i do not even like coffee hi mommy do not have enough money get more money great advice thanks james did you try klarstein passionata rosa 20 it belongs to this category and ha some great review i noticed you did not include the gevi in your comparison i wonder how you would rate it available from amazon for dollar99 to anyone willing to respond i started my espresso journey just recently and to be honest i wanted to learn alittle before just buying the best home use one so i picked up for dollar11 a used one of fb marketplace local i spent an hour or two cleaning it and used citric acid approach rather then vinegar based on many video now first time making espresso i only have two coffee option atm cafe bustelo espresso fine grind or pre ground christmas starbucks blend only used once will try it again next my model is also the delonghi ce 20 all black model which i can not find a picture of or review anywhere on the internet so i have made several attempt and i think i have improved but they all do not seem to make a creamy foamy top and seem disappointing compared to when i get espresso from local bakery venieros in nyc so asking for any advice before i do more research and just use this one till i finally upgrade price really is not an issue just space is and i have only just started my journey any tip or recommendation i am all ear i love your voice and way of speaking and explanation to your video will be a long time fan going on a month now jameshoffmann i have the krups one at home and i slightly disagree with you i learned how to work with this machine it took a lot of time and i need to tell you if you make the coffee more properly with a proper tamper you can make quite good coffee and i know what i am talking about but yeah it is a bit challenging machine and the thing with the spitting water is a normal thing i guess it happens to me too and it is annoying hi sir james maybe you can review a much cheaper espresso machine in the market specially the china made cheap espresso machine thank you so glad your channel exists i started out wanting to get an espresso machine to make myself some latte at home that led me down a rabbit hole and learning i can not make espresso for under 500 buck that then led me to your channel where i have learned a ton so thank you i got a dollar70 sowtech espresso machine from amazon and work wonder with it to make cappuccino latte etc they have their kink have you tried not pressing a hard with the tamper and using mix of coffee not just one type seems to take away the bitterness and give a good flavor and crema also with these if you leave it to the full brew time it will taste awful i always count for 20 30 sec then remove the cup and replace with another for collecting the rest this first part is always the best tasting and if it is concentrated with the burnt coffee produced after 30 33 second it give you the bitter dull tasting version you are getting just try szarvasi coffee machine which is insane cheap manufactured at hungary at a small town called szarvas where the name is from szarvasi from szarvas it is like a moca pot machinized jesus christ i love this guy he know coffee subscribes it would be great to see aliexpress under 200dollar coffee machine test too hahahaha i like dejabrew do not hate me on you got the first machine at 50 euro and it make wonderful espresso i can not believe the other one being so wrong you could make good espresso with all of them but you would need to adjust the grind size and get used to the difference roasting bean by day and roasting machine by night 2 20 how doe thst shape make him feel uncomfortable but he go on about how the buttplug looking one are cute lol i do not know what you dear mr hoffmann regard a terrible coffee or at which point you even start to call something coffee but i am very happy with the amazon basic machine and the very similar mesko and camry machine at different place i am regularely at all of them produce coffee with crema that is very well drinkable especially with some milk and far far better than anything one of these ten time a expensive jura full auto machine that are otherwise omnioresent at my company ever produced sure it is not a gourmet expresso shot but that is what nobody expects from these machine to have these i go to a coffee shop if you want an entry in the world of espresso machine at home then what you get for your money from these machine between 60 to 80 euro in my case is just amazing worth for your money if you ask me the grinder is very important though and that is a good point you made at the beginning one should be willing to spend at least an equal sum for one if not more i wish i wasnt poor you were clearly sponsored for this video joke lol could any of these make good coffer if you change the pressurised portafilter for a standard portafilter to compensate for the finely ground coffee my delonghi stilosa ha a pressurized portafilter with a new design it using a spring loaded check valve so the coffee only come out when it at pressure i think it working much better than the old type of pressurized portafilter basket those have a tiny hole that liquid spray out of causing aeration and foaming but the check valve allows for a much more even flow the crema is better i have a similar machine a krups il primo circa 1994 with a made in switzerland stamp on the bottom it is true that every coffee puck ha a blast mark from the water but i have been using this for decade and i enjoy my cappuccino far more at home than at most high end coffee shop which to me taste bitter and acidic maybe i am a coffee wimp but to me it should taste bold rich and full bodied and not have me needing to add sugar to compensate for bitterness with the exception of a few fine portuguese restaurant it seems no matter where i buy coffee from out i need to temper it with sugar krups of course doe not make machine under dollar150 in switzerland anymore but maybe that is the secret in my case heck i do not trust myself with a grinder so i have a subscription for lavazza qualita rossa which i have enjoyed for age now to each his own i suppose thanks for your video it wa entertaining and educational i do not know how many more year i will get from my 27 year old machine so i will keep the delonghi in mind d i am not agree about krups i have one and it doe make a great espresso thanks for taking the shot i wa gifted the delongi a while ago amp if i am honest the only thing i want more than a decent espresso machine is the space it take up on the sideboard so useful learning about the pressurised basket i have the swan and i thought i wa getting my coffee too coarsely ground a it run so fast so i wondered if this meant i wa not getting the best extraction i asked for it finer last time and it is running incredibly slow on that grind size it ha a lovely crema with the courser ground coffee but not so much with the finer grind i guess this is to do with the basket doe anyone know if it is worth getting a regular basket for any of these machine or altering anything else or is the reason for the pressurised basket to do with the pressure of the machine perhaps they are not powerful enough for a regular basket i have to say i have been enjoying the coffee i have been making with this machine but still feel in the experimentation stage and would love to hear if anyone ha made any change to improve their espresso with a starter machine or of it not worth changing anything what grinder is he using the niche zero a coffee grinder time to start dreaming thanks james have been looking at that retro and delonghi machine but now i will go for something else i have a gun just kidding for a person that love coffee this is the worst horror movie i have ever seen the delonghi wa my gateway drug into espresso haha now just a few day ago iv spent a small fortune on a lelit mara x chasing better tasting quality espresso need to wait now for the end of march for it to turn up can not wait what about vertuo line or the original line from nespresso is that a good option or you would go with a moka pot wow love the marc rebillet shirt he is a crazy but very good artist i love his music and really like the video just starting out on my coffee exploration and almost watched all of your video already haha next video variety of expensive espresso machine pleazzzz james u rock james again thankyou dajabrew omg i itttt thankyou james james make a review about the staresso sp 200 my wife wa really confident that your name wa alex goggle my first machine wa a krupp very nasty indeed second a swan which lasted about 1 5 year also poor third a dualit so so at best fourth a sage ok till broke after 2 5 year you are honest i respect that thanks james very good and insightful review i wa indeed looking to buy the swan or delongui but will save myself the trouble you might have covered this already but which machine you recommend for those of u that are price sensitive but still want good coffee without costing too much to the environment either i want to say thank you for your charisma for your good explanation and your sharing anybody know the grinder hi james at one point i had a la pavoni europiccola excellent machine after taking year to get it dialed in made great espresso sold it and now have a nesspresso pixi not a good but make acceptable espresso for the convience i have a logik machine like those thought i wa getting good espresso until i had a chance to use a barista grade machine they say there is no such thing a a stupid question only inquisitive idiot consider me the latter with this question is it possible that these unit with the pressurized portafilters would perform better with the coarser grind of coffee that the manufacturer assumed the end user would buy or is that a nonsensical notion that go against the law of coffee physic in response to your question i have the swan machine aldi gbp39 used it three year solid two cup morning and intermittent through day and evening i use a braun grinder and with a bit of experimenting get pretty decent coffee probably not the best but better than a lot of cafe coffee i have paid through the nose for aldi italian bean ground almost to talc are good enough and easy enough to use for every day brew i accept it is not top quality but forty quid and much better than instant cafeteria filter etc and quick to use the guy look like a person that need coffee just inorder to breathe que marca e el molino de caf this is the most snobbish video i have ever seen it is ok to feel superior about our coffee choice you must be new here please talk about smeg how do 450 people dislike this are they 450 amazon employee shareholder you are wearing a marc rebillet t shirt i had this window open to show my wife that we should not get a machine that cheap and i just came back and noticed that it is just disgusting lol my sister gave me a mr coffee espresso machine i am pretty sure it is cheap but i can manipulate it into giving me a great espresso sometimes and good one most of the other time but it all depends any different bean type or bean origin or roast and grind change everything bit of a bummer id like to see someone do some engineering on one of these cheep machine to see if it could be modified to pull better shot the high cost of good espresso machine sort of offends and depresses me at the same time if i can only spend dollar100 on an espresso machine i probably can not afford a dollar700 grinder a better video would be a dollar150 machine with a dollar150 grinder james i do not wan na put my hand on a warm ish machine to remove the portafilter also james will put both his hand on the machine just to mock the quality of the plastic these coffee snob are worse than wine snob okay but your opinion on moka pot they are more affordable and that is how i grew up drinking coffee a a cubana so none of these are the best i would love to see a video for the best cheap grinder how low can you go and still get great result a few year ago i went though three delonghi machine all were defective and each broke in under two month they were all the same model which wa step up from the one in this video i bought them from three different vendor in different part of the country i will never buy another delonghi device of any kind i did not know what i wa doing and had not done proper research i just went ahead and bought something to make myself a morning americano or so i thought i wa a a complete beginner yes but the machine were all piece of junk and the coffee they made tasted crappy before thy broke btw they still sell that model gordon ramsay of espresso my dollar99 00 delonghi ec155 ha gotten me laid thousand of time the video wa very interesting i enjoy espresso every day with delonghi is magnifica s i also subscribed to the channel please come visit me on my channel with love from japan best under 200 this video wa not a review but a statement that dual walled basket machine are junk you should have used a tiny bit coarser ground dial it in a the instruction likely state of course you already knew that so who wa this video for it wa not for the mass i do wonder how the machine would perform if the portafilter wa swapped out i have one and modified it the coffee improved massively i am sure there are still drawback but i do not have the palate to taste any remaining short coming and what wa the grinder brand only just noticed your mark rebillet shirt of course you do time for grandma hmm i thought the delonghi is also a pressurized portafilter or maybe that model doesnt have that one i have a delonghi espresso machibe and it come with a pressurized one i saw on scg they recommend running the steam to help bring down the heat of the machine when pulling shot we had exactly the same delonghi espresso machine at the office and i can confirm it made drinkable espresso unfortunately we upgraded to a bigger machine a if that make it better that make hot sewer water and this is when my journey to discovering manual coffee started so at least something good came out of this situation i wa looking at buying an espresso machine around this price after watching your video i do not think i i will bother how much will i need to spend to get a machine that will make good coffee please thanks buy a used gaggia classic for gbp150 the amazon basic is not even amazon is it is a gruppe italiana just with a different name and worse quality you ll all grow out or this sort of thing that marc rebillet shirt i think these test would be better if james use same basket and a proper tamper for all i think people will definitely buy a proper basket and tamper after buying an espresso machine deja brew this is a comment this is basically a video on not to buy espresso machine under gbp100 where i can contact you for seeking solution to my coffee mechanic problem in extraction i own the delonghi one it work really well in the technical sense but it is it is so haphazardly put together come with the world shortest and hardest to clean steaming wand the top is heated but if you dare to heat a cup up there it will slide right off if you so much a look at it wrong you have to throw your shot from the left side where the steaming wand is on if you are unlucky it will drip boiling hot water directly on your hand it is a terrible little cube shaped menace that torment me every time i walk into my kitchen but i would buy it again if i wanted an espresso machine and had a budget of exactly dollar100 what is the grinder he should do a blind test he is obviously a biased snob broadly unpleasant hi james i have recently bought a swan retro any idea if there are any naked portafilters i could buy for it for all u freak ojt there who are seeing this have a nice day the end extremely spoke to me thanks best fucking way of doing a review no unnessecary talking just plain fact thanks man wow thank you i am not going to buy any great voice by the way for those of u who are financially challenged when or where can i find the bare minimum video you have trailled here many thanks i would say look at his flair neo video pair that with the same hand grinder he us in that video timemore nano or timemore slim and you got exactly the setup james used when he called the shot he pulled wouldecent it is about 245 dollar for both grinder flair you can add a 30 dollar aeropress and you can make great non espresso coffee too i have a flair neo and i am very happy i froth milk with a french press and i like my cappuccino more than most cafe i go to and i have yet to upgrade my grinder to a decent one this is supposed to be the most important part for taste hi james i bought the delonghi from your link i have fine ground coffee but when i am drawing espresso for my latte i am not sure what is going wrong should i use a single shot and if so how long should i draw it for it also seems quite weak any idea why thanks beautiful video thank you what grinder wa used savage i appreciate the honesty imagine making this guy a coffee in the office chris haha i agree i just imagine a 6 hour lesson on coffee after making it james is a pretty nice guy he would just smile and drink it even if he found it unpleasant he is definitely particular but he is not an asshole i would like him to make the office coffee only to be told it is hollow finnicky and offensive to him a a cup of coffee hey mate thanks for the video did you have a chance to look at the sage barista pro please have a great 2021 i am loving your video james if your budget is gbp100 and you really want something that can make good espresso look up staresso or 1zpresso y3 those are manual espresso maker under gbp100 that can make better espresso than all these poorly made machine and they are well made and you can even upgrade the y3 with proper basket and electric pump to control the pressure if you want to later on nice shirt marc rebillet is freaking awsome i love his show this guy voice is similar at time to chris eubank if your eye are closed why doe james look like he is solely responsible for gentrifying the entire district he life in but he doe not come across a a hipster from his attitude though fr thumb up for the marc rebillet shirt i got a good experience with a silvercrest kitchen tool expressor after almost one year of using it how do you drink so much coffee without being jittery this channel is a total lifesaver this man is saving u potentially thousand of dollar thank you thank you thank you dunno about you but i wasting so much more money now on coffee but i am loving it have a shot everytime he say frustration i am wasted james the advert running within your video are for a scam website that claim to sell niche zero not sure if you can do anything about it back when i worked at starbucks jeeze over 10 year ago now i remember my manager intentionally calibrated the machine wrong to pull bad shot and had me drink them so i would know what a good shot wa like i ended up becoming ocd about it same thing happened to me with foaming milk they changed how they wanted u to do it and i refused to change my method cause it ended up being more inconsistent the amazon one ha nothing to do with amazon it is a first austria chinese espresso maschine made for amazon rebranded a a student i had it cost about 50 60 euro you can do some ok coffee with it if you put an effort but it is 50euros what did you expect i had a delonghi ec155m i believe that it is about identical to the ec146b it certainly doe look it except for more metal in the body i got one new on clearance for about 80cad nearly two year ago a friend who know espresso better said it is ok on it own right and for half the regular price a must buy if you are on a budget i mean i understand where the whole enjoying it and hobby thing for coffee but i am of a long time coffee drinking culture it doe not have to be a hobby to enjoy the end result i find this delonghi to be the absolute best you can buy in this range bar none i get that you are running on a budget level that most people just do not have i enjoy your video and have tried to do what i can with what i have got to match but you honestly make it sound like unless you are in the top 10percent of income earner you can not enjoy ok to good espresso at home and i am not a fan of the inference spending 400 dollar on a machine is considered expensive even if good quality machine run into the thousand with the little ec155m i have converted so many friend from drip onto espresso and i think that speaks volume and really earns it the title of best only decent entry priced machine and hobbyist exist outside of the top 10percent earner and you do what you can with what you have got half a year ago i upgraded to a delonghi ec860 used for 200cad i like the automatic option it had a pid default is a pressurized basket but you have compatible basket you can buy for cheap the portafilter is solid metal save for the handle and ha a decent weight to it i think that it doe just fine one day i will upgrade to something prosumer and likely away from delonghi certainly something with a better steam wand design although it steam well enough and quickly i use a bodum burr grinder 100 cad yes i spent more on the grinder than my first espresso machine it grind really well for the price review i have seen give it a 7 10 for grind consistency i try to buy better quality coffee and keep it fresh i sincerely feel like i get 80percent of the quality for 20percent of the price even if i had to go to brand new the sage breville bambino wa recently 350 cad on year end sale currently 380cad is the delonghi better than an nespresso thanks some of you may be wondering what he meant by pid controlled well basically the temperature of the water ha a sensor which talk to a computer the way pid control work is if the temperature get too low you need to add more heat to get it back to the right temp and if it get too high you have to remove heat but then you get iunto a back and forth where the temperature is always dipping and rising trying to catch up the way pid work is it us the area under the curve to calculate the error from the desired temperature and it also take the derivative to calculate how fast the error is changing that way it can correct the error and find the sweet spot without having lot of temperature fluctuation no one ha said this yet but thank you that is really interesting krups xp3208 is very good espresso machine but james do not know how is make coffie espresso with krups xp3208 is perfect coffee machine help i want buy my first coffee machine in home only i drink coffee can you help choice something not very expensive but good product sorry for spelling mistake best wish from poland what a wanker m fine but a bit dull just what i want from a cheap espresso i want to ask my friend had a cheaper espresso machine but accidentally lost the tamper a an exchange can i use a rockpresso tamper instead thank you a ton it very amusing to me to watch this obvious coffee snob judge broke people espresso machine i am very broke i need guidance xd had 3 krups side by side never had that hole in the middle made ok expresso first lasted 12 year second 6 3rd 3 year they kept using cheaper plastic for planned obsolesence now i have an electric delonghi and the stove top bialetti good expresso is great but primarily for caffeine and well you know wa hoping there wa a decent machine c est la vie 7 40 that terrible taste likely ha to do with the cheap plastic being heated up that leaf a distinct flavour i have had it with a princess pie maker that delonghi is literally a watered down version of my original dcm 1385 thats been out of production for like 15 year some how mine came with a 58mm group tho the extra filter on that cream colored one is probably to stop rust chunk going into your drink p so delonghi it is what i have learned from picking up a handful of hobby and becoming a bit of a nerd in each is that the amount of knowledge and equipment that you need for a hobby is just a much a it take you to enjoy it for some people that might mean investing thousand and seeking perfection in every aspect but for others it might be a cheap machine that doe not get up to 10 bar pressure and pre ground coffee from the dollar general point being if you like the coffee you make and you have fun doing it then you are doing it right i feel like this is one of those thing where you need to spend quite a bit to get to the point where it is really enjoyable and not just a gimmick that end up unused on a shelf i have had a cheap espresso machine and preground coffee a terrible blade grinder it wa not fun and i gave it away i am not saying that anyone is wrong for enjoying messing about with a cheap and nasty setup but i did not and i suspect they could get more fun and nicer espresso adjacent coffee spending the same money on a burr grinder and a moka pot and maybe some way to foam milk for a little latte type drink but that could be an gbp8 french press from the supermarket that is certainly been my experience and there is a good reason why the moka pot is the standard way of making coffee in italian household they are delightful and although what you get out is not quite espresso it scratch the same itch mountaindew267 interesting comment weird example but i get where you are going with it i do not happen to think everything is subjective i think there are somethings that can be measured a good or bad right or wrong but the fact of the matter is everyone can not afford a dollar2000 professional machine or maybe they can afford it but do not want to invest that kind of money on a machine if comparing head to head a professional machine with anyone of these machine the professional machine win hand down but that doe not mean people can not enjoy using a cheaper machine jordan everything is subjective say you were on an island with 20 people and those 20 people really enjoyed drinking piss you prefer pineapple juice but they think that is disgusting and piss is the only drink that is really good are they right something doe not have to be good for people to like it mcdonalds is successful after all it ok to like bad thing i just do not like when people can not admit it a bad thing because they like it lol the reason for the pressurised filtres is simple people want to brew 60 to 80 gram of liquid and have a nice crema on top they then add a drop of milk and some sugar they then have an espresso cup filled with what they think is espresso if you skip the milk and sugar you actually get something espressoish this is a feature not a fault it suit customer taste mr amazon want to save the world but waste resource and carbon making crap and selling it world wide more crap in the atmosphere and ocean have you ever thought about taking over for sebastian cabot hw cn i get it in pakistan but james no matter how long i save up i will never be able to buy a good espresso machine i spent gbp100 on a secondhand gaggia classic instead it is lovely and make very good espresso hey james i am in the market around 100euros i came across gaggia vivo style for around that price would you recommend it over krups planing to buy non pressurized portafilter for any sure but budget machine do not last long my lt dollar100 barsetto just died lasted 18 month and pump died i am pissed and getting a delonghi i got the delonghi ec155 for christmas and after a little trial and error i learned how to make a really enjoyable cup of espresso it is my first espresso machine i got it to get the latte budget under control with a little practice people should have no trouble using this machine one thing i learned is to tamp it lightly this seems to make a big difference another thing is to drain any water out of the frother or your milk will be watered down there are a number of helpful video on youtube for anyone interested i think this is a good first machine for anyone just starting out with making home espresso can not wait to hear what he ha to say about the 35 dollar machine i got on target in my defence i am a broke college kid if you are going through the comment before watching the video and after proudly have bought one of these espresso machine because finally you could afford it please get out i have something very similar to the swan basically the lidl version gbp50 i felt alright about it i use it every day multiple time usually have an americano or just espresso sweetened with sugar or honey i have just ordered a non pressurized filter hoping it will fit and anxious to see how much difference it will make in the meantime i will be saving money to get a proper espresso machine like a gaggia the delonghi i have had for 9 year it is ok but it no longer work so i have to get a real machine sadly james doe not like the next step up the delonghi dedica deluxe but i do not want to go to dollar700 for a coffee latte in the morning so hmmm nvm i loved him instantly with that thank you jeff line i really appreciate this guy is passionate commentary but goodness could not you sound just a bit le pretentious so i have a retro coffee machine close to that retro one im pretty sure that they are the same just different brand and different layout mine is a retro coffee machine by vintage cousine do not ask me wth is that brand because i do not know xd and at least the water come out softly the only real problem is the basket will it be a good machine if i wa aible to switch to a non pressurized basket and where to find them thanks p i need help because the coffee i make even tho it ha ton of cream taste weak even if i put like 10 gram for a single espresso also take the shot extremelly fast like 10 second or so i have swan myself in germany we have aldi oursson brand for them and i bought a single and double shot basket non pressurised proper tamper hario skerton pro grinder and proper naked portafilter in that set it work surprisingly well so yes you can not just buy this machine and be satisfied with it but it work for a tweak base i think anyway thanks for this review reminds me that all home espresso machine under 500 euro are more or le shit by alone without modification hi good detailing and appreciate the honest opinion when are you planning on releasing the budget machine for full esspress experience video hi james i have the de longhi 15 espresso machine since 2014 it is been 6 yr now and i still use it when i bought it it cost about dollar64 u dollar i am still using it to this day it doe not make great espresso but it make a decent one if i want to spend le than dollar500 do you think i should do with a manual espresso machine or a non manual one what is more enjoyable to you thanks finding out james is a marc rebillet fan is such a trip should have looked at something like the staresso modified a krups still can not get good espresso out of it worthless what do you think of the breville bambino whats the best commercial grade espresso machine i feel like swan retro is better you can simply depressurize it a shown in other channel and the analog thermometer help you to gauge when to pull the shot better than the ec146b i have which i have totally no idea what is the temperature imagine being so privileged that drinking espresso out of a dollar100 machine is not good enough for you i am over here enjoying the hell out of my dollar45 mr coffee espresso maker i am a huge fan of starbucks and used to go a couple time a week and now that i have learned how to pull espresso shot i make my own at home for penny i even buy the starbucks brand for use at home and it come out amazing every time time your shot for 30 second and pack your coffee firmly and evenly into the portafiller that is all there is to it save your money for a nice vacation instead of a pricier machine like this snob suggests just my opinion though thank goodness i watched this video hi doe anyone know if the breville one touch coffeehouse coffee machine ha a pressurised portafilter i watched this because i wa considering the de longhi but my budget is about dollar150 so is there an espresso machine you would recommend in the price range of dollar100 to dollar150 what grinder would you pair with these entry level machine imagine how insufferable this bloke is in person my favorite part of this is the marc rebillet shirt listening to this in the background then about spit my coffee out at 5 30 in love you james this hipster convinced me to go for nespresso i would be interested to see you review the coffee pod system a an alternative i bought a tassimo and it is poor do any of them actually produce and shot of acceptable quality wow i am glad i watched this the swan ha been rebranded by kmart in au nz and ha become really popular after a couple of consumer advocacy group rated it better than a dollar1000 espresso machine and a dollar4500 fully automatic machine i really suspect that preground store bought coffee wa used in all machine but paywall prevents me finding out i have a delonghi but an older model with a drip filter side by side with the espresso section i have always found it a bit of a faff and easier to just make a carafe in the filter but it doe make a decent espresso by my standard when i choose to i just choose to use one of my other machine more often this video is brought to you by china i have the same delongi machine i am trying to get something resembling ok coffee out of a gaggia gran which also ha a pressurized portafilter so far accidentally i managed to succeed once which i ha not been able to reproduce ever since now i am trying with various grind size and output volume and hoping it is just my hand grinder which i am about to replace for something better or is it generally impossible to get anything good out of this impossible i have tried just buy a regular portafilter can you suggest your top 5 espresso machine for under gbp450 dollar600 i am looking at the breville bes870xl barista express a my top one right now but also considering a pod machine nespresso lattissima one original is my top one right now love the t shirt ahah i bought the swan recently after having a bean to cup jura machine that cost 12 time a much i prefer the swan and only ever drink black coffee espresso he described that third one like i do my ex hollow empty sour and bitter lmao it is just disgusting xd best comment ever made my day dude dddd   extreme channel flavour i bought the delonghi just to see if i enjoy expresso making and if i like it i am going to find a good one in the use market delonghi any input welcome trying to decide between breville esp8xl cafe rom stainless espresso maker and de longhi 15 bar pump espresso maker ec702 metal for christmas gift or is there another in same price range that is better thank you you made me stop giving a wrong decision thanks how about nespresso machine marc rebillet merch shoutout so i presume you would not buy one full stop krups is a german brand and it is pronounced like oops pretty accurate in this case check out james other review including the new stretch me strap on that he personally recommends this may humor you or make you cry in this documentary learn the process of design and manufacture of crappy western product designed for the mass there is a coffee machine in the doco chinese communist labor camp or why can i not get my employee to be so loyal joke it is what it is we human are a weird bunch unfortunately for krups thats how they all get water out i have an older model krups about mid range in term of how expensive and it ha been spitting water out like that since day 1 what brand wa the grinder though i have a black and decker that seems very similar and it wa like 75 usd got it 5 year ago spent a day or 2 getting it to work passingly to make ok shot and because my morning coffee wa usually a shot in the dark or something of that nature mixing a shot into iced cold brew or hot drip coffee i got a lot of use out of it it never pulled great shot obviously and it did take a lot of dialing in grind size and tamp weight to keep it from channeling it worked fine for foaming milk too and keeping it on the counter wa nice for surface cleaning because steamed as water on a rag very informative thank you sir i am currently searching for an espresso machine to buy and happened to see the video hoping that it could help me save some dollar on my choice look like i am naive and being completely wrong aeropress i bought this inexpensive lumen espresso machine thats very similar to amazon in my frustration i stopped using after 3rd attempt and junked it a year later been using french press eversince thanks jeff i have a bean to cup machine i use it daily i know that the espresso out of it is not perfect i would love to see a similar review series of bean to cup machine please i have watched your best machine under gbp100 and also gbp500 i found both hugely entertaining i also had the realisation that i know nothing about making espresso i do know that espresso in the chain coffee shop nero costa etc for my taste is undrinkable very thin and bitter and unpleasant i do know that i can get great espresso in a bunch of cafe in dalston bethnal green etc my only knowledge of making coffee is with a french press with is ok sometimes i do not have a grinder yet so i rely on supermarket ground coffee i have a budget of gbp200 no real knowledge other than an appreciation of good espresso and i want great espresso at home can you help i really like the way you editing the video very short concise and straight to the key point very pleasant for viewing and understanding shout out to the marc rebillet crew kau je la terpaling kopi sekali must say i enjoy your video i have a delonghi 3420 my first machine i use an unpressurized filter and have mastered a decent 25 30 sec shot have been pleased with what i have been able to pull off with this cheaper machine now i want to go to the next level i have a budget of dollar500 what would you recommend a my next machine within this price range hoffmann please when you do these test make them blind i mean tasting the coffee without knowing which machine have made it until the end with marked cup for exp if more people like this one make this kind of video maybe just maybe we make those company stop making shit product and james speaks of 60 to 100pound machine do u know how many coffee machine below 50 are there like a milion and ppl buy this shit lol now im drinking coffee for year but stil do not know when coffee is good or not digging the marc rebillet t shirt kudos ma dude  james please do a vid on the cheapest way to make a sweet nice coffee but not great coffee using any method thank you coffee steve buschemi you have helped me a lot i wa really hoping one would be a winner mokapot or the delonghi machine yes love that shirt this is the most pretentious video i have ever seen and i am in love with it only to discover you should save for something better and a subtle humor is no one going to mention the marc rebillet quarantine tour shirt i do not have one of those exact one but i do have one thats fairly cheep however it pull decent espresso from what i can tell it doesnt use one of those pressurized filter but it doesnt really have any form of regulation please could you do one for filter coffee machine i wa tempted and made a purchase on the delonghi stilosa e260 it ha a pressurized portafilter and i have a cuisinart automatic grinder i can not get a decent shot with either of these product i would appreciate some feedback or help on how to get the best possible espresso using these two machine i realize that you get what you pay for the delonghi stilosa is coming in at dollar100 it feel a bit on the cheaper side a well i usually end up making milk drink without ever actually tasting the shot of espresso all my other coffee i drink black with a wide variety from chemex french press or pour over for a simple coffee enthusiast like me i am highly considering the delonghi i wa initially into picking up a nespresso machine since due to it wide variety but i find it costly on a long run idk how much coffee this guy drank while making this video what is the difference in construction between a pressurised coffee basket and an unpressurized one seems like a metal filter with fine hole on the bottom can any of these brew a full breakfast mug of coffee instead of tiny espresso cup i have a simple machine that make a mug that is supposed to be divided up into little cup and it make better coffee than drip machine because the brew basket is perfectly clean every time one more thing to look at is the material of the boiler aluminum alloy are more tender and can not take regular cleaning with acid an espresso machine is not a breakfast mug machine it is two very different thing if you need mug sized amount of coffee try the hario v60 or the chemex alternatively you can add hot water to the espresso and make an americano a a sort of crossover between the two what is that grinder this guy is hilarious he is so dissatisfied with these machine i do not want to buy any of them for sure this comparison wa very helpful after two year of improving my espresso skill i am looking to move up from our trusty breville barista express and into a prosumer machine i do not suppose you have a video coming that would include the rocket espresso mozzafiato timer type v espresso machine by any chance any opinion on the rocket brand in general but what about the illy espresso machine that cost about 100dollar i wa hoping i could find some feedback on that thanks for any further feed back on that one i have a swan not bad for it price mr coffee espresso machine dollar40 usd been using for year on my 5th one could not afford the more expensive one great video i love marketing and the first espresso machine ha a great retro look and color too bad it crap time to start saving my money for a machine hopefully never on this list i am just sad the swan one is so cute but is shite amazon seems to have redesigned the amazon machine like completely redesigned i am anxious to see a review james it is the bean stupid not the machine would a non pressurised basket have made a big difference to the other machine so this also fall into spend a little bit more to get a lot more category avoid anything at budget level hi james i would love to know what would be the best used vintage machine to buy under that say dollar1000 dollar mark cnddollar love the show and in just a couple week you have upped my espresso game thank you is the de longhi magnifica espresso machine good asda smart price coffee 50p nice loop daddy shirt i just like that he is honest he tell you if it crap and which one he would go with if he had to pick one but the downside to it would love to see that bare minimum video a i can only spend bare minimum grinder amp machine i have the de longhi it made decent coffee for almost a year many per day the filter that fall off is very annoying is true and it is light that piston on the side also is inconvenient but in the absence of another one is good to have it come off if necessary everything wa fine enough a few day ago it changed i descaled it twice with no success and then i took it apart all the component seem fine one valve wa a little stuck so i reduced the tension on the spring a little calcium came out i guess the descaling did not quite work completely the acid dissolved the scale but even after two tank flush it wa still retaining some powder will test again tomorrow i had too many coffee today the sad part is that it is supposed to be 15 bar pressure but i have no way to measure it and neither the temperature of the water unless i just measure the temperature of the coffee that come out of it inside i can see the pump that ha an extra check valve at the end and a boiler no apparent solenoid but two set of contact in the boiler one definitely the heater the other not sure i am a tech but first time opening this kind of machine and with limited time i would like to know what the other set of contact are internal solenoid or a second heater what grinder did he use would not it be easier if you switched to cocaine same or better kick without the surrounding pretentious circle jerk of look at me i know what i am doing i am an expert environment would be better off too for those in australia the swan cream coloured coffee machine ha been voted by choice a one of the best cheap coffee maker sold in kmart for dollar89 hehe what gear do you use to record james camera mics etc brilliant review thank you thanks james i will go for a delonghi is it possible to switch the basket to see if that help the crappy machine should i change my pressurised basket and if so how to know what basket is compatible what a bitter video doe anyone know if you can pimp the swan retro with a real portafilter just asking for a friend of a friend obviously there is an even cheaper machine john lewis have re branded the krups machine a jl some say it is cheap and nasty but by placing a piece of filter paper over the ground before inserting in the machine the taste is improved slightly for 100 quid all i ask for is is the coffee ok ish get a small used professional gastro machine if you want to save money have you find it yet it would be great not to waste money the cheapest machine which offer you a barista experience can i still get crema with a dollar50 espresso machine what is the brand model of the grinder love the marc rebillet shirt wild to see my two favorite creator in the same video even if it is only via indirect apparel cameo omg i love marc i just found this channel and could not believe i wa seeing it what grinder are you using when he bent the one machine i almost died great review extremely helpful thank you 4 of those have the same portafilter and use the same chinese thermoblock with the same switch mechanism they all fit 51mm basket you can use ec685 non pressurized basket single or even ese though i am not sure how well that would fare with some practice and a dollar10 non pressurized portafilter you can get decent shot out of the one with a working dispersion screen just like you did from the delonghi my experience with non pressurized basket is that these machine have simply too much pressure for a normal basket high pressure and a pinhole is the formula for constant flow rate regardless of what you put in the basket it seems to me that slowing the flow with actual coffee mean a grind so fine that you are on a knife edge between flow and blockage and for me that meant i definitely got better coffee but it wa very inconsistent my grinder is not great so i can see how a better grinder would improve thing but i am thinking that even with a good grinder you are fighting against the law of physic it seems a pity they can not add a low pressure switch i can not seem to shake my skepticism that decent machine must be expensive thank you so much i wa considering that krupp machine i purchased a krupp coffee maker before and i rather enjoyed it obviously there is a lot of difference between good coffee and good espresso thing i learned in this video the reason my coffee might be tasting bad is that i simply am not preparing it right i had no clue that thing that seem like small detail could affect the flavor of the coffee so much i am glad i know now with the pressurised portafilters if i wa to drill the single tiny hole to say 2 mm pressure can not develop and i would essentially have a standard portafilter would i not i have a delonghi that look almost exactly like the one you have but it come with the rubber gasket basket like the others when ii make espresso at home with the same bean a they use when i get espresso at starbucks and it taste nearly identical but i only paid 50 buck usd for mine from amazon the only thing i do not like about the machine is the basket it wa hard to find a decent espresso machine that didnt cost over 500 dollar all the one i saw between 100 and 500 didnt seem to be worth the price i wish there wa a decent espresso machine for 100 200 link to grinder please great video hi delonghi ec 156 is good machine for espresso long story short all rubbish that shirt would it possible to try comparing drip coffee machine i got a delongi one recently it is really plasticy and feel really bad the coffee wa okay would be keen to know if you could really make any good coffee out of these kind of machine well that wa fun love the marc rebillet quarantine tour shirt i am 50 my son is 16 we both love youtube and each found you independently i am a conservative he run liberal we bond over coffee amp your video we love you ty the real question is what grinder is it krups doe not make a good anything a a drip drinker generally with a crappy steam espresso maker and french press a well have you tried the aero press of all the beautiful glass brewing option that are unrealistic for some people like me the flavor control on this device are the most interesting i roast my own from sweetmarias com great channel you have also any opinion on udaini coffee if you have tried it i imagine roasting that gold is le problematic than gesha curve there wa so much gentle disappointment over the course of this video marc rebillet shirt i would like to hear james hoffman is opinion on nespresso capsule machine that is what i just spent money on and now a i watch my first video of his i am rethinking my purchase probably will not be good he despises them basically nicko persilion thanks look at his cisno portable nespresso review get a used delonghi and install a pid and tinker around with it you will get a pretty good cup of espresso comparable to machine about 15 time the price lol love your review on this video love the humor too i have a 20 y o de longhi espresso and drip coffee machine at home the espresso part is basically the same my sister ha espresso machine for 40 euro and she say it is the best coffee machine in the world i have 8000 euro machine and say it is good machine any chance you can get you hand on the grindie solo i am pretty sure it is going to be a bit towards the expensive side of the cost scale for a grinder though i have owned the silvia for five year it is a pretty amazing esoresso machine for someone that enjoys tinkering and building not only their espresso skill but their maintenance and repair skill i purchased a heavily used older model for about dollar300 and it ha held up it is value nicely i have had to replace some part but that ha been relatively simple and inexpensive about four year ago i retrofitted the steam wand it steam wonderfully i temperature surf and get great result i will say that making multiple hot beverage at once is a real pain a i need to do temp surfing for each beverage and with the milk it add that much more work it would be easier if i had a larger pitcher and could maybe steam milk for two beverage at once although i have never tried that i also find waiting for silvia to warm up in the morning can be frustrating a l that metap take a while to get to a good equilibrium i hope to one day install a pid and plug silvia into a timer i think that would change a lot of my issue i will say though i am thrilled to have such a great espresso machine that proveds very good result a is what do you think about the smeg esspresso machine i need a review that loop daddy shirt though so the best cheapest espresso machine say gbp150 i have a cheap oster machine i bought down here in brazil a few year ago it come with a pressurized porta filter ha a huge water tank and delivers hot creamy espresso every time it help that brazil is one of the largest coffee producer on the planet great quality coffee bean are readily available i followed your channel for a while and only now did i notice the marc rebillet t shirt haha anyway i own a similar krups and it seems it doe not dig a whole into the coffee like that one but i tested it to see if it overheated causing that jet of steam and it seems that is the key difference it doe not i can get some decent shot out of it the only thing that piss me off a little is that drip tray one day i will get a decent machine so the 99 pound espresso machine is better than the 300 pound aldi espresso got it you are a pressurised portafilter for many espresso drinker the portafilter is a path of initiation due to the large number of parameter to be considered it often take year until under constant discipline by the machine one is able to approach an optimum many of these coffee drinker are not driven by pleasure but rather by the search for perfection you are constantly tinkering with your machine trying this and that and never finding your satisfaction basically this whole so called coffee culture is a fallen angel of meditation completely slipped into materialism since the perfect espresso inevitably cause the perfect disappointment the smart consumer will always go for a cheap machine if a halfway drinkable cup succeeds here the delight is much more intense than a well balanced espresso could ever provide why quite simply perfection bore it is the lack that make u happy dude we just want a good cup of coffee for cheap this whole so called coffee culture is a fallen angel of meditation completely slipped into materialism that is undoubtedly the single stupidest sentence i have ever read in my life i literally just want something that taste really good not all of it is snobbery here i am eleven month later just to say this i am not sure if i agree or not but your comment wa weirdly enjoyable and calming to read we have a delonghi in work which is ok but the steam arm doe not work so i also had to get a milk frother i have noticed gentleman ha very good focus can you please review beko 5152b i like to see your thought about that one thx would using a filter paper on top of the puck prevent the channeling at this price level a used saeco barista is worthwhile if you can find one for under dollar100 one particular note though a james alluded to you have to understand that if you buy a used saeco barista it is a modified portafilter which cheapens the true draw and make it taste terrible you have to strip the portafilter down to make it a real portafilter take 10 minute at most now you can make true espresso but the beauty is the machine is a well built machine for the money nothing really anywhere close on the market for dollar100 for sure these machine are built in italy and use some fine heavy duty rust free casing many many time the original purchaser have bought the unit and have no clue how to use them or got them a a gift and hardly used them usually in very good condition they work well for the price and can teach you why buying a good grinder is more important if you are going to get into buying a real espresso machine the saeco barista will either make you want to never make daily espresso again and leave that for someone else or you will be challenged and intrigued and want to buy an even better machine and get into the fine art of making better espresso at home the way pro and enthusiast do and it is not snobbery because think of how many other hobby and interest people have that make you want to tune them out gardening bird watching cooking detail car engine painting baking wine high end bourbon and disitlled product etc 2 22 lmfao which grinder is he using here amazon machine is probably a converted shower head thaaaaank you sooo much for this review hahaha i love this guy i suggesto you to check a saeco or a gaggia are the same if you woant a good espresso for le than gbp100 what are you opinion on delonghi ec 685 bk it a little bit more expensive than the one in the video if you were to add le gram to the krups basket would you still get channeling or wa it a bit too full and that is why it happened espresso also ha a different brewing method it is made by forcing the steam to come through the finely ground bean it can also be made from any coffee bean too just like drip coffee on the other hand a pour over or filtered coffee us coarsely ground bean it is made by pouring water over it in a filter hence the name nevertheless the preparation process is what make espresso different espressomachine madeinitaly pressurizes coffeebeans espresso coffeebean dripcoffee groundbean coffeemachine coffee hi james this one slipped me by during lockdown my bad what is the grinder you are using keep up the tasting and good work slacker yes i did see that thank you i have two of the metal one he tested but use them only for pepper and spice a the grind is very inconsistent i have a hario skeleton which is great unless you need a lot of coffee then it get tedious char10tt3 hario well depends on the model is a perfectly fine starting hand grinder james made some video is about the best cheap handgrinder i do not know if you have watched it but incase you didnt ill give you the link he also made a video about the best premium handgrinders wich cost more but is cheaper then the niche and definately worth it here is the link to that video good luck but mostly have fun slacker superb thank you it is a bit spendy a you say i would most likely get slapped back to yesterday if the other half found out i spent that much on a grinder oh well back to the hario hand grind the grinder he us is a niche zero exspensive but very good grinder for espresso here is the link so you can check it out jar of maxwell house boom job done how about frothing pheew what a relief being an delonghi owner i know it not the best machine obviously yet a you have mentioned it probably give the best coffee you can find in that range perhaps espresso is one of the world is most known coffee but what make it different from a regular coffee for one it is a strong and healthy coffee variant that suit those with a discerning taste espressomachine madeinitaly pressurizes coffeebeans whenever you say interesting i take that a bad can you do an review on a seaco machine could that be better swan retro is really the best spoon is okay interesting i am looking to upgrade from my delonghi that i have had for a number of year however i do not really want to spend much more a my espresso hobby a you put it fall second to a much more expensive hobby of motorcycling hobby and my sole mode of transport i am interested to see what the cheapest machine for the best coffee would be with the caveat that it will almost certainly be different for everyone based on taste and palate and budget taurus bari and donlim dl kf600 are under 100dollar and better then delonghi great review for starter in 2008 i received the delonghi a a gift that got me started some research in 2011 got me a rancilio silvia second hand with nemox grinder only in 2019 i bought a first new one liked the rancilio but went for a ascaso although boiler might give you some extra i appreciate the thermobloc kudos for the marc rebillet t shirt love his stuff buy the gaggia new classic for 400dollar and enjoy a real espresso for year to come nice shirt 2 20 hahahaah you can make a little pixar movie about it in the future lol what coffee machine would you reccomend can you post the link to the grinder big fan of the marc rebillet shirt thanks for the truth a 1000 time saeco have you found a bare minimum for good espresso i am looking to get one but i am willing to save up a long a it is reasonable gaggia classic best entry level real espresso machine yanagi soetsu make beautiful thing make thing to be used eliminate everything that is unnecessary hi james i am your fan excuse me what do you think about the nespresso vertuoline machine thanks so i have a delonghi slightly better one ecp 35 31 i wish u could try coffee made from it and tell me how u found it it give different coffee everytime it depends on the coffee alot and on the milk too if u are makinf milk based coffee i have never had a good espresso in my life so i do not know what is good espresso espresso is always bitter is it supposed to be like that oh i have the rightmost one aldi also sold this best buy it make the best espresso i have ever drunk secret is i do not have much experience with espresso so i am happy with it d am having a blast this man it would be great to see this series continued and see which espresso machine get your stamp of approval for a price that doe not completely break the bank after seeing this review i have one question which also could be the title of the next review this kind which is the cheapest espresso machine you can buy but also ha relatively good result thats a great video and sadly i am inclined to agree that you can not get a good espresso from sub 100 machine a cheaper thermobloc machine with a depressurized portafilter and an ok grinder could get decent result it might not be a enjoyable a better machine a so many variable will be wildly fluctuating i started with a 80 euro 2nd hand saeco via venezia although a depressurized portafilter did exist for it mine sadly did not came with one i tried to mod it wrecking the portafilter in the progress and thought i could get away with preground fine supermarket coffee that wa a disaster these machine with the exception of the one with a normal portafilter will make you an espresso inspired drink especially if you froth milk it will be okish my general advice if you do not have money for a decent espresso machine which many aboout 10 year ago considered rancillio silvia to be a solid entry level machine try to see if you can get an e61 hx machine 2nd hand a second hand grinder or just forget about espresso and make good coffee by using a decent grinder and nice moka pot james hoffman i do wonder with what gear you started out with your tamper is deeply unpleasant oh princess love the t shirt i can not imagine im the first to ask but a good video would be how cheap can you go on everything in the process from bean to grinder machine even mug i did expect that shirt love you even more now what grinder is this i really appreciate this review of yours but is not this the exact kind of review you did not want to do a stated here you will never see me really review commercial coffee machine i am a little confused probably misunderstood you and would appreciate some clarification i do indeed look forward to your review of the best espresso machine under euros500 i had no other option for a time but to use a similar very cheap mass produced plastic machine i eventually found i could get something just drinkable but i had to grind quite coarse and tamp very hard putting almost all my weight on it got my faema fixed eventually and the cheapo wa given away gladly fellow marc rebillet fan can the portafilter used here can be changed with other standard portafilters used in commercial machine the marc rebillet shirt if you know you know best espresso machine for under 100 none of them looking for a hack to help the pressurised filter i enjoyed this video so much would love to have seen the breville cafe venezia in this mix up yes i know 100 wa the limit but still it built the same a the others i thought he wa gon na say on the question could you get good espresso for 100 no but you could get a moka pot i had de longi for almost two year and i do not recommend it it is very noisy and vibration are so strong that you should hold your cup moreover after 6 month of use it started to leak i have linea mini with mazzer grinder it a pretty good setup for the home james could you do a review overview of the nespresso machine i would interested to know how the automation of espresso making effect the coffee thanks could you do a review on the delonghi dedica ec685 i am interested to see what you think of this machine any update on that bare minimum espresso video deja brew anyone youtube heard me chat about coffee and the next think i knew i wa here anyways the most important lesson here is do not let your wallet do the buying for you when authority base in any field tell you something is not good chance are they are right now if you would be so kind to make a video on which expresso machine is the best bang for your buck not cheapest let is call it suitably priced for functionality we will all be happy camper mr james and community do you have a recommendation for an espresso machine and grinder for a coffee enthusiast under dollar1500 i continue to progress in my coffee journey and i am looking to make a modest investment i would love proper recommendation outside of my personal research any help or direction is much appreciated it pretty funny to watch this you know in hungary the most popular espresso machine is szarvasi which ha a lower price like 40 50gbp and you find it like every 2 nd household i want to see you do a link up with marc rebillet anyone know what that beautiful grinder is called i know you thought i wa going to say deja brew but i did not because i do not hate you or me i came down to the comment section specifically to look for this comment the sound of this guy voice sound like someone who ha smoked 20 cigar and drink espresso for hydration it is not pleasant at all just caught the genius artist name on his tshirt im a fan too so glad i watched this a i wa so close to buying another delonghi i had one that i got on ebay worked for a while during the height of the pandemic on the ne i thought about replacing it and found the one i wanted out of stock that wa a good thing a i have been close to trying again you are so right machine is noisy and not worth the effort thanks for reminding me i will stick to my moka pot and my aeoro latte to make a very acceptable latte every morning used to be a barista and when you are accustomed to the pro machine hard to get used to the at home variety thanks for your other video moka instruction helped me fine tune my method with the easy stove top and inexpensive route we all know he like coffee but now i also know for a fact he like naked dude that funk do not ask me how i know i have a delonghi ese a slightly more expensive machine than the delonghi you demonstrated it is still a basic machine no temp gauge so i always preheat my first cup in the microwave and i can only put 10 gram of coffee in the porta filter but the coffee pours nicely ha good crema and taste good i know i am cheap but i also like the thought that i am the one pulling a shot and not the machine that take a lot of the skill and knowledge out of the process at the end of the day his standard are really high what his ok for him is probably good for the average consumer who doe not want to spend 5 99 for a cappuccino everyday lol in italy a cappuccino is 0 60 1 20 euro if chris eubank were a white barista i have been enjoying your video over the quarantine a i bring the coffee shop into my house did you ever find an espresso machine you would recommend i am trying to make a latte with an aeropress and an ikea french press and it is not easy to accomplish latte art which i am currently chasing what would be the best bang for my buck espresso machine considering i got dollar500 or so to play with completely agreed with him looking forward to see part 2 so what is the grinder got ta appreciate these video it is a good way to find out if something is worth buying in store waiting for it what is the grinder you are using imagine him coming to our house and we offer him coffee what is up with his voice it is therapeutic i believe those rubber gasket are for the pre portioned easy serving espresso pod i have had a few different delongi machine never so cheap and my experience is they are all decent for the money i saw the swan model in an aldi pamflet just today thank you for saving my wallet and my sense of taste sooooooooooooo just get a flair neo if your on a tight budget and this is why i drink tea is it weird i find him and his lip attractive i am in mid 20 lol age is just a number the swan look identical to the kmart brand coffee machine we have over in australia nice video nice shirt how about the best bang for buck coffee machine i wa planning to buy a dollar40 espresso machine i do not think it worth it anymore when the 100 pound is not that great even actually with the swan retro mashine you can remove the pressurizing plate with the tiny hole to change the portafilter from pressurized to unpressurized then you can make better coffee dear mr hoffman i own a really cheap espresso machine after pressing my coffee in the basket i put a piece of round paper filter cut from a v60 coffee filter this way the really bad water distribution of my machine is kind of normalised and i get a solid puc a delicious espresso and a smile every owner of a crappy espresso machine like these should try it totally worth the extra effort gil vit dear gil i am honestly really glad to hear that dear george i used your advice and seeing great result from my cheap de longhi espresso machine shot are consistent and produce balanced and tasty shot channeling is practically gone i honestly recommend the paper filter on top to any one having trouble getting good espresso due to flow issue thanks again george i do not even like espresso but am i going to watch all 10 minute hell yeah whats the coffee grinder really looking forward to this series and finding the best cheap machine i wa thinking to get one of these but i bought moka pot instead let buy mini marzocco it cost only 4000 euro d lol but durable and the perfect shot hey james i love your channel but i need a billion dollar question answered what is the one you use at home everyday i have a lidl silvercrest espresso machine which is almost identical to the swan but only gbp50 the interface is much better but it is drippy and there is very little space between the attached portafilter and the drip tray however with that steam wand too i am very happy with the price i paid for that hoping to find a proper single dose filter basket for it one day i bought an espresso machine from lidl it is cost around gbp45 and for the money it is good please do your bare minimum test soon great channel thank you can not wait to see that bare minimim espresso machine video i would happy buy a manual lever machine if it turn out the be the best value for money i just do not want to buy crap i have got a barsetto and it look really close to that andrew james one it is a step up from instant coffee but a long way away from proper espresso good work on calling out shitty product it is sad that greedy corporation push out trash product that will ultimately end up in land fill just to make some money waitting for chapter 2 something under 200gbp gt i have a delonghi caffe treviso machine an older simpler version of the one used here sometimes it produce good espresso most of the time ok ish for really good espresso i visit a friend who ha the proper expensive equipment and know how to operate it can you get good not excellent espresso with a pressurized porta filter bought a breville barista express yesterday do you guy think that it is a good buy and a good first step into the at home espresso game i like aeropress for coffee but are these cheap machine any good for steaming milk for latte and cap a these are cheaper than a standalone steamer please do a best espresso under gbp1000 you forgot a classic the gaggia machine i bought this on sale for 63euros and i am very happy with it so far i am using it with regular moka style coffee lavazza qualit rossa and while it is not gon na win any award it still come out perfectly drinkable and much better than the crap that i have drank from many bar i am not a coffee expert or anything just a regular italian who usually enjoys a coffee so long a it doe not taste like a burning tyre it also ha a proper basket like the delonghi in the video but i have not yet tried it with a proper espresso grind coffee like the crema e gusto espresso one but i am planning to in the future can you review the gevi 15 bar espresso machine so far it ha good review i would really love to see your best basic espresso machine so le focus on price but more just simple machine for beginner without fancy extra and a massive price but with full manual espresso functionality thing like the delonghi dedica sage bambino gaggia classicx rok and flair that do not take up much space i would like to see you do a video comparing a premium bean v a supermarket bean on a breville what about sage bambino time for the best espresso machine under gbp200 gaggia baby i picked up a rather ancient salton ex80 espresso machine at a garage sale the other day for dollar5 it had never been used and came with 4 small shot cup 4 larger shot mug plate creamer and small spoon i think it wa manufactured in 1996 really loud when you use the milk frother for cappucino would definitely wake the neighbor downstairs i am not really an espresso person choosing to make my coffee one cup at a time using a manual pour over melitta basket and 2 cone filter i use a cheap dollar20 electric kettle that delivers a nice creama but it stay in the paper filter and not the cup so my first cup wa a mess i did not have the coffee holder completely seated so coffee and steam sprayed out the side next attempt went smoothly using simple preground medium grind coffee however when i got some actual espresso ground coffee at home good only half of the water got through the ground really got packed in so i think the fine grind is not correct for this machine funny the small tin of coffee cost dollar6 more than what i paid for the whole machine i am having le success with the milk frothing i had to bend the frother tube out a bit to fit my cup and be able to move the tube around the cup this step is where the machine get really noisy it is nice having the milk warmed up but a for the frothing it really doe not seem to do anything my half and half doe without all the noise hey james it would be really helpful to hear what you have to say with the de longhi dedica and also the smeg espresso and maybe other at home easier espresso machine out in the market it would be a great help thank you i had a plastic delonghi that i really enjoyed because i did not know much about espresso at the time i used it to make latte so i did not taste the awful coffee good thing i got it for 15 and that i found a breville sage bambino in a thrift store for the same price most of the part were missing so i bought the rest by contacting breville amd in the end i only paid 20percent of the price big big difference between the two what is this grinder we are looking at gaggia classic pro and a saeco xsmall trying to find a decent home machine under dollar500 any recommendation that are similar or review comment on these thanks jeff the shape make kind of uncomfortable lol could you try some china is brand espresso machine such a welhome kd 310 gemilai 3200c milesto em 30 wondering is it worth to buy those i always get a starbucks double shot on ice drink 5 shot espresso i can not ever get my coffee strong enough i make cold brew but i would love to get espresso machine make starbucks coffee espresso what machine should i buy i do not want to go over dollar250 i have a very old version of the krups machine reviewed here by james which i picked for gbp2 at a garage sale some time ago i have just spent a few day descaling it with citric acid to the point where it flow freely and will steam milk the steaming arm had to be soaked for a few hour in vinegar to unblock it it make coffee with crema maybe not good crema but any crema is a novelty for me so i am elated it will only take 16g of coffee and the flow could not channel more if it wa specifically designed to channel having watched some of james is fabulously well informed content i am ready to try and make some real espress or should that be pull some real espresso i have a krups burr grinder which is i had already realised even when using with a moka pot a bit crap so my question to other commentator is given i have not got the sort of money that in my world would buy me a fairly decent car to spend on getting a good espresso what grinder and machine should i consider getting hold of wheres the espresso machine under gbp400 review really need your insight before buying one for myself i wonder whether the main thing holding these machine back is a lack of brew pressure control no opv i have a more expensive machine the sunbeam em6910 it ha some great feature but it ha no opv it is simply impossible to pull a shot using the currently recommended brew ratio pressure and shot time if i grind for pressure the time will be too short grind for time and the pressure will be too high bug the hell out of me and i simply must upgrade i really like the look of the ecm casa v because it ha a user adjustable opv long ago i bought a delonghi 9bar machine it wa cheap and basic it made ok coffee but after a few year all the seal started leaking more and more to the point where you had to sit it on a tray to catch all the leak and eventually i stopped using it very good but this machine possible to milk stream i enjoy your delicate sensitivity yes i have the delanghi 1 month and froth light is out what would u recommend for 500 00 dollar thanks nice video but what about a second hand machine so what do you consider to be a good affordable expresso machine for home can you make a video on that please you know you got ta flush them out before using them right i never understood these cheap machine it is not pleasant to use and not pleasant to drink a big appeal of pulling a good shot is in the pulling itself working with a good machine dialing in a great shot it a hobby a much a it is great coffee there are so many other method to brew great coffee for even cheaper than these horrible machine a he say the pressurized portafilters tell the story it is for people who are not really that invested in or knowledgable about coffee or espresso that just think an espresso machine make espresso and deem the coffee acceptable because it will be drowned in milk anyway more of a cash grab from ignorant people just ordered a gbp95 75 priced at 119 99 usd delonghi espresso machine with a pressurized portafilter before watching this trusting the review on amazon now i have the worst sense of buyer is remorse thanks i just knew i would find the very best channel for finding an espresso maker on my travel looking for an acceptable espresso maker i came across the kitchen aid espresso maker have you any data on this one james i think it would be a treat to see in action it seems relatively new and seems to highlight many of the quality feature you find appealing unfortunately it is currently unavailable here where i live but i am hoping they will change their mind sooner than later why 100 pound why of course it is rubbish why do not you show some beginner machine for different price if i would like to get into espresso i would like to get a good machine for a fair amount of money it would be great if you would compare machine starting at a price where they start to make good coffee another thing to note is even if you are not a particular about the result with regular use these sort of machine often break down very quickly juuuust out of warranty and you are left with just buying a new one a repair option are limited or too costly there is always simply mile of cheap dead cappuccino machine at recycling centre and so forth but that wa not the subject of this video of course opinion the swan espresso machine can become a glorified paper weight can not wait for the bare minimum espresso machine video how about the saeco you would hate our espresso machine we purchased it second hand in a charity shop 5 year ago and it is a krups it cost gbp10 it took some experimenting but the coffee is pretty good imho i would love to go to a coffee tasting workshop to see what you are talking about btw our favourite coffee is in italy anywhere lovely coffee country coffee in france is hit and miss and sometimes a joke i wonder what european country is best for coffee we have not been far please tell me what to buy then really keen to find out what sort of money you need to spend to be able to pull good espresso realising that my dualit set up is not cutting it when are you going to do a video looking at how much you would need to spend to get a quality machine best espresso machine for least money in the uk best bean to cup espresso machine for once a day use please if james blunt gave up music and started making coffee wait what james hoffmann in a marc rebillet t shirt lovin that marc rebillet gear mate i would love to see this video updated but with blind taste test to eliminate any bias what is the name of that grinder ok i need your recommendation in the midrange price range can not wait for the upcoming review i have a 120dollar mr coffee found a fit 51mm regular basket from a breville amazon use it every day with a 75 conical burr grinder modified to work i get a decent shot semi consistantly well my mr coffee failed after 4 good year the de longhi here work well with my old accessory tamper basket steam wand and ha a mod community in which people make bottomless portafilter etc im excited about the ec155 great info thanks i wa planning on buying one of those trying to choose the lesser evil you changed my mind thank you for suffering through subpar espresso for me really thank you omg im so happy to find this video before ever having to buy a cheap espresso machine thank you so much for the insightful review hi james i am drinking only espresso and i am using a jura automatic espresso machine we bought this machine after our pad machine broke the machine is fine and also a good possibility to make a lot of coffee fast but the espresso is just ok my best espresso wa a double shot out of my friend 1960 la peppina espresso machine full of flavor so i am waiting on your video for the absolut minimum requirement to get good espresso the automatic machine will probably stay for my wife but i want to upgrade to a pure espresso machine greeting from germany i have been having instant coffee all my life and i wan na improve my coffee experience can i get any recommendation on a coffee machine i do not want it to break the bank and also a coffee grinder try a bialetti stovetop moka pot you can get one for around 30dollar and make pretty good coffee and easy to use or if youd like a little more in quantity then consider a french press bodum and oxo make good one and you can get around 30 40 for a grinder make sure they are burr and not blade cuz burr grind more consistently check out burr hand grinder like from hario or java presse due to being pretty cheap or you can try something like a baratza encore grinder for around 70 80dollar but it electric so faster and better with coarser there are some good stovepot or manuel espressomakers for that price title the best espresso machine under 100 james no jose a i do not get the vibe that he disrespect other people is preference for coffee i enjoy the fact that he is truly passionate about his love for coffee and that his standard for what make really good coffee is high enough that he will make video like this one that lay out the reason why you should not skimp on certain thing if you want to have a good cup mondaynities v because i like coffee and wanted to purchase a home espresso machine jose a then why are you even here auntiecristie good for you but i personally would not spend more than 200dollar on a machine i just want to make home made cappuccino i do not really care how hollow the coffee is if i am not even drink it alone i just find this guy kind of a purist who do not respect people who doe not have the same compulsive passion for coffe solaxe s because we are the 10percent i think that the cheapest usable espresso machine is the gaggia classic anything cheaper and you far better off with simple pour over coffee you are funny i have been drinking espresso for more than two decade but still i have learned from you broadly unpleasant i wa looking at the swan and the delonghi but i am glad i held off now thank you de longhi motivo espresso coffee machine is great for gbp60 bought on sale definitely save you a lot of money if you love capps every day what if you replace the shower screen under the krups or the amazon basic machine make with the next vid i want espresso and i am very poor coffee machine dio mio market awash wi machine price mad for me best machine cost circa gbp30 lavazza is best for smoothe rich coffee from my experience those simpler espresso machine require 10 20 water cycle extraction without coffee into it before the first extraction have you gone through them i just love the way you insulted those machine tl dr please listen to james i do not have one of those but i have something very similar i know it is a bad machine but money is tight these day unfortunately so i kinda perfected how to make something decent from it for the time being i would never ever recommend the machine i am using because there is a huge learning curve to making something nearly drinkable also keeping it clean is a really big chore not to mention water get everywhere after using it even though the drip tray is not even near full it come with the same plastic spoon tamp thingy and it is pure evil it is way too small and flimsy oh and one more thing those plastic easy frothing piece is literal garbage it is horrible to use and to clean if you really want to make a good froth you have to take it off and use the metal directly instead you would need a lot of practice for making a good one though so if i wa to take my mccheapo pressured portafilter espresso machine and press a 1 inch diameter coin into the centre of the puck at the top will not i greatly increase the area of the shortest route into the single dot exit point like a cone could pressing a coin into the puck be a very simple way to improve the quality of your espresso in other word i have made a few and they taste okay nothing blew up so pretend i am not very clever could not an enterprising person just make a metal bowl that slot into the portafilter of your mccheapo espresso machine and turn it into a multi hole non pressurized portafilter then sell them on ebay for dollar5 and you could get a professonal ish machine very cheap you should make your own machine i would buy it you know your stuff what would be the cheapest espresso machine that make good coffee that you would recommend i need that video of actually good home machine unfair and uninformative finely ground and compressed coffee for espresso is basically a fetishism only required for old school machine pressurized portafilters are an excellent innovation and only requires some learning and goodwill to provide you excellent coffee that actually taste better than old school machine thanks to the power of science research and modern technology if you fill the whole portafilters and tamper it you are doing it wrong used a machine like that for a while and i dearly miss it take your shot then put a glass shot glass under and take another shot with the same puck and see what ha not been extracted on the first shot just a coffee nerd thing i always do to see what i have missed finally content that i actually find important the best espresso i have been able to find for under 300dollar is the delonghi ec680m dedica it is not great but it make a good shot the saga or the breville are worth the extra fund or the ranchilio is probably your best bang for quite alot of money andrew james is no longer in business oct 2019 machine available are unlikely to have part or repair if needed and the warranty is not backed up by the manufacturer name of the grinder what s your opinion of the smeg espresso machine is there a vid with him cringing from a sip of coffee and a normal person delighting in it i would love to see that thank you mr james what grinder do you use should have watched this before buying a machine could you also link what grinder you used a video on how to look after your machine and clean it properly would be super useful i have been in search for a good espresso machine with a steam wand and would love to see a review of some of the more expensive one i have been debating getting an espresso machine like the gaggia classic or the breville bambino plus v one with a built in grinder i e the breville barista express my conclusion so far is i would prefer to invest more in a really good grinder and then just get an espresso machine with a steam wand rather than try to get one built in because most of the one with a built in grinder people have said the grinder is the worst part i e the breville barista express would really appreciate if you considered doing a video like that i appreciated this video did he just drank 5 cup of coffee in a row i would be shacking by the 3rd or 4th and yeah i am new here i have a delonigi that look very slimier but ha a pressure portafilter it wa given to me a a christmas present i bought a cheap hand grinder that is not particularly good and i buy my coffee from a local roaster i normally make an americano with it and occasionally a latte i do not have experience of using better quality equipment so am not used to the taste that they would provide however before having it i would buy my coffee from starbucks on my way to work or uni i feel that the coffee it produce is light year better than what i used to get from starbucks and i use in almost every day instead of going to starbucks so it is a lot cheaper in the long run plus i get to choose different bean each time i buy more coffee and i really enjoy trying the different flavour they produce so for me an entry level machine doe the job even if it not perfect and i would recommend to anyone who buy an americano every day that is also happy to get up 5 minute early to make their coffee although not one that dig a hole in the ground coffee in the portafilter a that would probably make undrinkable coffee judging by jame is reaction it is also proven to myself that i would happily make my own coffee everyday so now i know when i have the money to buy a better machine and a good grinder i know they will not just be expensive kitchen ornament hi james hoffman thanks for your work i just wanted to point something about those espresso and it is you are not using th e original maching but copy and cheap one what is the grinder please i am curious how he feel about the delonghi versus a moka pot two cheap coffee maker that purport to make espresso get an used gaggia classic great for beginner and middle advanced espresso lover watching from america why are european espresso machine so heavy what is the make of grinder bruh 60 pound is still really expensive in sweden 20 pound machine are expensive wait marc rebillet shirt nice can the cheapest emc machine make excellent espresso you are a marc rebillet fan i see you are a man of culture what am i doing here i do not even like coffee tf huge fan james but you need to lift some weight at the gym a bit more you come off a scrawny definitely looking into getting one of these for my mom my father had a krups for many year but a more expensive model i think it wa closer to gbp300 and you could get decent shot out of it a long a you dialed in your grind setting for it after it broke down he tried a couple of machine i think another krups and a delongi at that price range but both were extremely disappointing i actually own that delonghi machine and i can confirm that it is possible to make good espresso with it if the task is approached with patience and enthusiasm i am never in this mood when i wake up so the machine is only ever used on lazy sunday afternoon when i am in the mood to play about with it getting a good shot out of it is challenging so i use it when i feel like a challenge but not when convenience is required look like the italian know a little about coffee what is the grinder he is using doe anyone have experience with delonghi ecp31 21 click on me i send 2 nd hand refurbish espresso machine from krups europe wide forgive me if this wa asked already what grinder did you use and how much is it i stopped to like the video after the not hating you or me comment actually lolled wa not expecting a marc rebillet cameo when trying to find an espresso machine you got my sub the moment i saw the marc rebillet tshirt omg love him and love you lt 3 i had the delonghi for about 7 year yes noisy but it did the business cost me gbp59 it finally died replaced it with the krupp which wa awful lasted about a week before it died build quality wa poor replaced it with another delonghi for about gbp78 a more up to date version better build quieter for me i am not to fussed a long a it doe it is job every day for me the delonghi did the job and for 7 year it made at least 2 cup a day sometimes more so i will stick with delonghi i am not an espresso connoisseur but i like a decent cup of coffee so i aim for the sweet spot with price amp functionality oki i bought the delonghi a couple day ago used on facebook marketplace lady said it had only been used a few time and it looked like it she wanted dollar50 but i got it for dollar30 ive been using a moka pot and or cezve for a couple of year and wanted to try my had at espresso i figure that this is a good entry level espresso machine to see if i am interested in progressing forward time will tell but so far so good spoiler alert if you drink milk drink breville dual boiler is the cheapest best machine a pleasure to use and then diminishing return beyond that imo you can often get them for lt dollar800 usd on sale from bed bath and beyond i have seen them for dollar400 usd slightly used which delongi model did you use krups do private label production so would not be surprised if other than the delonghi they were all made by krups thanks for this review what is the best budget option in your opinion it must be awesome being able to go to work and sip coffee is it a better idea to get something used on fleabay honestly that swan retro machine just look super cool except i can not seem to buy them in the usa k mh after watching the review i guess i will look elsewhere it seems to be a real po smeg make an espresso machine which doe a similar thing though i would buy it too just for the look and use it just a little bit hehe my thought are that if your budget is lt dollar120 or so and you absolutely can not spend more then look in the used market or get one refurbished a friend of a friend bought his saeco venezia pre owned for maybe dollar100 locally and it looked to be in very good condition a brand new venezia in the u is maybe dollar300 when they were still making them that dollar100 pre owned saeco venezia after a little cleaning will out perform any of these brand new dollar100 machine shown in your video hello anorher video about coffee which i watched with big joy in this one i can also add from myself that last month i bought gaggia viva deluxe coffee machine it costed 400 polish zloty which is around 80 pound i am from poland a you might have guessee now i think it doe not have porta filter i am just learning how to make good espresso so i can not say if it worth the money but for my humble taste it i very ok maybe that one could be a good choice for espresso beginner wa tempted at the start but not by the end thanks james my history a a coffee nerd i had an earlier kru8ps model for about 6 month lightly used it lasted for that period then broke down it wa fussy to use and a bitch to keep clean which is why it did not get more use it went in the garbage and i went back to regular style coffee a an engineer and someone who like coffee that amazon basic machine wa deeply offensive disappointing but the reason i bought one for dollar300 why would anyone want an espresso machine that weighs more than 100lbs 100lbs is already too much james hoffman is my favorite coffee nerd thanks for the video liked for the marc rebillet shirt why doe not james try with coarsely ground coffee for which these machine were built espresso machine use very fine coffee hello always enjoy your video my espresso machine by capresso is only slightly more expensive than your model at gbp134 it look similar to your cheaper model with the same functionality no temperature gage just a temperature ready light but it pull decent shot with no channeling in the pressurized basket and leaf a dry puck it also come with a nonpressurized basket but i have had le success using it i would recommend the capresso for an entry level espresso maker i have used mine every day for two year and it is humming along today just a well a the day i bought it i would appreciate your feedback if any observation come to mind thanks i have had the delonghi for many year and it ha treated me well whenever i had the urge to have some espresso i am mostly a pour over coffee drinker but the delonghi is a great whenever i am feeling like having a cappuccino how do you find the milk frother im looking to practice my latte art at home so looking for a decent milk frother eight year ago i bought my used pavoni europiccola 1992 for 150 euro until now the best decision ever perfect shot now extremely consistent with tempmod and thermometer and i have a great experience and yummy espresso every time i have had that delonghi machine for over 5 year probably more like 10 now i have used it pretty much every day for my morning coffee at least a few time a week a well a serving friend family member when they visit a few thing the first is how messy it can get i am used to cleaning it now but the tamper get coffee stuck to it and fall off over the drip tray or get clumped up on top of the tamper at the back making it super hard to see it is there and even harder to clean it i remember being super annoyed at trying to get my coffee level in the porta with it i am a dab hand at it now but honestly i have looked at buying a separate tamper so many time but they cost a much a i paid for the machine the next issue i have with it is how long it take to warm up to a stable temperature it really need to be left on for a good 30 minute prior to being used if not the heating light will come on during the pour and the coffee is rather lackluster just going back to the first point a well when the machine is fully up to temp the top of the unit doe get warm but the steam adjustment knob on top can get very hot to the touch i have had the the istarbucks ground coffee given to me in the past and friend and family say it taste just like the coffee shop with this machine i know that is not saying much but for average joe who i think these are clearly aimed at if it can make a coffee shop drink at home that is good enough and that is what the delonghi delivers at sub gbp100 i had a lapavoni lever machine pl lusso which made great coffee now all broken up needing a major service in the garage so i bought the black version of the cream coloured featured here which i bought at kmart for dollar89 aud probably about 60 pound in australia changed the pressurized filter for normal one and use my lapavoni jolly grinder and it make great espresso it still work after 18 month so in my case well worth it coffee is so out of fashion now it now herbal tea keep up i have the swan rebranded a anko at kmart australia dollar89 aud which i panic bought in march before going into iso it wa a process of tinkering incrementally bit by bit but now several hundred coffee later i can consistently make myself a nice old school diner cappuccino on it i like to make the foam stick to an upside down spoon frothy like oldddd capps with a sprinkle of choc on top after two decade of moka pot coffee at home which still hold a special place in my heart it is nice to be able to have crema at the breakfast table one day i will upgrade but i get a lot of joy out of the swan cheer for a great vid good video i am currently using delonghi different type of machine but pretty much the same class do you think pre infusing the coffee will affect the result so sorry for the broken english i just bought the amazon basic espresso machine and mine is very different from what you have shown here i had a experience with that delonghi machine they are good for the price but the coffe is far from a delta q pod machine what grinder are you using what is the grinder this leaf me asking what is the best value combination of grinder and espresso maker on a budget or several level of budget hand operated or otherwise finally he review something i can actually afford i have krups xp3440 around 200e for which i had discount and paid le than 100e it in this category and i can say i struggled to make fine espresso i certainly do not enjoy in the process but now when i figured out the step i drink good coffee and for every one of my guest is really good tasting coffee so you can make it good for le money and little bit of nerve bought a cheap but nice retro looking machine to replace a nespresso machine could not get anywhere near decent n espresso tried different bean bought a good grinder bought other filter created 5kg of waste and then i came across this video and what doe james look at first the same but slightly older model that i have there is just no way i can get anything decent from this and i do not know why sadcoffeeface solaxe s yeah i agree i really do not think his reviewing style is aimed at the a more general audience i got my partner a breville one touch vcf109 from curry during black friday sale and she absolutely love it 150 quid in the end reduced from 300 and well worth it make a great espresso and the milk frothing attachment is quality latte cappuccino macchiatos all come out great doe the end product taste like i have ordered it from a lovely little cafe in italy no definitely not but it is comparable to starbucks costa etc in fact better because it all depends on what roast blend you are buying and a damn sight cheaper in the long run hasan shah i mean a horrible coffee by his standard is likely very good to most of u something we can buy it is shit so we would waste our money what grinder are you using i am not an expert i like a good espresso but in bad circumstance i prefer a lousy coffee over nothing meanwhile i am convinced on self grinding and seldomly use my machine for the stove but it can brew 3 double espresso at once so sometimes i go for it at about 6 00 i wa surprised how much pressure you put on the coffee my impression from other expert wa that you only put very little pressure on it the 174 dislike have one of these machine lol i have 1 problem i love the taste of coffee and tea and would drink it all day but the caffeine would kill me if i drank 20 cup a day i have switched to yerba mate about 50 to 75percent le caffeine i brew yerba mate like loose leaf tea in an auto drip maker 24 cup a day i started my espresso journey with a krups duo machine it had a drip brewer on one side and an espresso group on the other side it wa great for fumbling through a learning curve back in the early 90 is and early 2000s with a grinder and playing with dosage i wa able to pull something like espresso it tasted alright and honestly wa a great way to cut your teeth working with expensive machine now seems like a breeze i am poor but i also like coffee i would like to hear some recommendation on what to buy to have smth decent for your money a french press decent coffee need not necessarily be espresso the marc rebillet shirt in hyena on netflix highly recommended when they are not drinking soju they are drinking something out of a nespresso however you never really see the drink being made you just see a very good looking drink when they pick up the glass what is the likelihood that these drink are not coming from an actual nespresso my lock down experience ha consisted of walking a block for my daily white mocha a well a having bought an aeropress early and making ice coffee with it almost every day from illy ground coffee intensio since i do not have any grinder it is been better than nothing an english man trying to show u how to make espresso ridiculous go get a rokpresso guy hi james can you try hibrew espresso machine than can brew nespresso dolce gusto and ground coffee could you make a video about espresso machine between 400 and 600 pound please btw i love your video 2 27 say it james d i l d o hey james love your video i am looking to step up from my current pressurised machine but i am still at university so my budget is very small can you maybe do a video on 5 inexpensive non pressurized espresso machine please i am looking to grind my own coffee and my current machine just will not cut it andrew james machine to james no you are a drippy little group head hey james starbucks is releasing a new espresso machine look into that it is going to be in the coffee shop it is sleeker and take up le countertop space and i think the shot come up from the bottom up it doe not make good coffee it will disappoint you lord throw the whole machine away i am starting to think this dude is serious i am sitting here dying from laughter his shot are firing on all cylinder when he said putting his hand on top of the machine i died i have a krupp similar to that one and my coffee come out great and the water jet is just fine where you picked up yours the junkyard there should be stricter law regulating fitness for purpose it is almost criminal that these are being mass produced are you ever happy satisfied with anything ever watching this video after buying the krups what happens if you just make espresso from this using the coarse coffee doe it still make good coffee wondering challenge of the year you should collaborate with a manufacturer and design your own entry level unit you can not make a good machine under 100 these brfands are not stupid it is just not possible okay comrade electronic engineer right here i can design cheap electronics for those coffee machine with a lot of functionality 10dollar for a pcb with temperature probe would be a good start the real problem with these thing that they are not sold you in sick and hammer way having 20 added value i am pretty sure that those thing ha the same production production price even for 300dollar border usually you just deal with chinese factory that make those retrograde machine but you just ask them for specific characterisitcs and then they are taking off the shelf design or doing a new one for extra price point minmum production amount is larger after that they take standard piece just to waste resource on another generic coffe machine so we can sit down design a new machine that would not solve problem of generic supermarket piece of plastic that is designed and produced in a bad way with a large profit margin that will end up rottening somewhere in middle east for hundred of year is there the solution there is but it is more about economy book and my adventure in army than about coffe but it is okay if design is needed we can sit down try to take an example of chasis then the most simpe and easy to produce part that work perfectly then i will put electronics that will controll flow and temperature fun part that encoders are cheap enough to use those a universal control organ extra button and an encoder for setting if everything would be opensource they can become very popular but okay here is my email kek engineering protonmail com heck even a manual press cost more than a mid range coffee maker i second that that would be awesome i bought that swan machine it is awful you would brew a better espresso shot through a bag of spud i used to have a bean to cup machine which wa quite expensive not long after the warranty had expired it ceased to operate i sent it away for a quote to repair and wa told it would be gbp180 i thought that wa excessive so told them to keep it i bought the andrew james machine for gbp62 i thought if it last a year i could still buy another 2 machine and would have cost me gbp180 anyway over 3 year later i am still using the same machine it make perfectly good coffee for me once you get to know the machine and learn what technique give the best result then you can make perfectly acceptable coffee i find that buying the right bean to suit your taste ha the most influence on what come out i would definitely buy another one the bare minimum to have a good espresso at home i am waiting for that james metoo j c flair manual press with the gauge an electric kettle and a manual grinder probably looking at 350 all in this is more like the worst espresso machine under gbp100 i had a delonghi very poor now use a lavazza modo mio fantasia never let me down although using pod the swan retro look exactly like the baumann espresso maker that we have maybe the manufacturer is the same but distributed by different brand it is pretty decent for it price point for me anyway i know james ha a high standard when it come to coffee do a review on nespresso machine espresso refillable pod with your fav bean please i just bought the swan getting decent result good crema nice tasting coffee fresh ground illy bean it is just warm water going through some dust how complicated can it be uk is like another world to me never heard of any of these what is this the 1950s lol anyway wish you could review one in the usa that would be decent enough to make a decent shot and be able to connect to ipad or phone and see pressure etc how hard is that why are there soooo expensive can you do one about which one on amazon i should get in the u which would make decent espresso i want to make espresso and gauge pressure and all of that but do not want to pay thousand plz help i bought this about a year ago mostly because of the price point it is a pressurized portafilter so the result go about a you would expect but it is been a relatively good experience for me i do not have proper espresso anywhere near me so even being able to pull subpar shot is a nice change of pace make decent milk drink too although i generally find them lacking in flavor i am being completely transparent here but what is your dream favorite espresso brewer do a vid or two on that and why you like it btw thought on percolator v other thing why espresso so much cheer how these espresso machine compare to nespresso krups you do have a defective machine this happens to me only when i brew specific coffee such a jacob espresso arabica exclusiva even though it work normally when i brew jacob espresso intenso trying to find a solution brought me to your video when i brew the former the result is awful and then it disperses water in the way you have shown it can get back to normal if i keep dispersing water for a few minute when i brew the latter the machine work perfectly and i can make several coffee without any trouble at all x hi james can you make a video talking about which grinder do you recommend for certain method which one are better for fine grind to make espresso and which one for pour over and which are le noisy hey nice loop daddy shirt all i need is a coffee machine you can shipped in my crib what to do to get the best out of cheap espresso machine there is a large community that hack the delonghi depressurize the basket add pressure meter change out the steam wand for one that can actually do thing i would love to see your take on modifying the machine but i think you can just throw a few pound to buy a hammer for the delonghi it may improve a bit dude lol your krups is defective also fill that damn portafilter the right way lmfao p s a decent tamper can easily be bought for lesa than 10 buck i am glad i saw this nearly picked up the delonghi really looking forward to your opinion on the gaggia classic in the next round please make sure you include it in the line up had a cheap sub gbp100 machine in the past and i never enjoyed it and could never get good consistent coffee a year ago i got a refurbished gaggia classic and a good second hand flat burr grinder and thoroughly enjoying it consistency is there and it is pleasant to use been enjoying experimenting with grind and more often experiencing how my bean preference change between filtered coffee and espresso thanks again james so what is the bare minimum cost for a good espresso machine 7 09 the whole machine actually just bend not something you seek in an espresso machine and likely not one of the bullet point in their promo lol would love to see a video of the dollar40 mr coffee espresso machine from walmart it is not a bad unit if you just want strong coffee that is basically just a drip coffee machine disguised a an espresso machine well i mean it is a steam espresso machine it is not a pump espresso machine like the one that pull real espresso shot from pressure i have krups it make solid coffe with good ground coffe like lavazza it make better coffe then in moste coffes did you taste all these on the same day how are you not tweaking why do not you just come out with a video that say the complete step to step guide to brew great espresso and exactly what you need i do not want to just know what suck i just want you to tell u what is good seems like james might come out with this very video in the future he said something about wanting to figure out the bare minimum near the end of the video so we will see a few month down the line if he is found anything if not that is fine he is a coffee enthusiast not strictly espresso please review philip ep222010 he sound like winnie the pooh my first espresso machine wa krups xp4030 and it wa quite decent machine it equipped with non pressurized basket which is resulted in good espresso you could play with grind setting and tamping even the steam itself is capable to generate micro foam after 6 month i sold it for silvia which then i heard the machine is dead a month later i am looking to buy a espresso maker will be waiting on the new vlog and you post link for them i have the delonghi i have had for about 5 year maybe an older model look the same i am no coffee expert i use whatever pre ground coffee my hand land on i hate instant coffee and roughly know when real coffee is really bad i get espresso that is no worse and nearly always better than the big chain knock out the delonghi is fine for those who just want an okay espresso at home it would be great to see the best espresso machine for the money the marc rebillet shirt wa unexpected and delightful now i want to see marc rebillet review espresso machine but in his own style you know how many marc rebillet t shirt can you buy for gbp99 so i have had the amazon basic coffee machine but not from amazon let me explain i bought it from oster which is a company that many of you recognize they use the exact same design a amazon doe but it sort out quite well the problem with the water channeling and all that stuff i mean it is not great but a far a i can tell it produce a much better espresso than the one reviewed i am this episode btw i love this vid keep it up with the good content i have bought a espresso machine this week that is completely similar to amazonbasics but it name is nova ncm 146 exps it is good enough for me when i pay just 75dollar my dollar120 mr coffee 15 bar finally work great ha regular and pressurized i used to use pressurized until now i finally can use the regular basket after have to regrind my coffee and use proper tamper for all that you said you should not be in t shirt even if is expensive i enjoy the video conclusion only rich people can afford a machine that make a good espresso b greeting from indonesia that is why you get the flair espresso maker best value but you have to get good at it thanks for this fantastic breakdown fwiw i make an ok cup with my delonghi ec702 with modification 15 g dose at 8 grind on baratza encore my biggest gripe is the design of the basket housing and how wet the puck still is also it can not be trusted to pull a consistent shot consecutively due to the lack of temp gauge doe anyone have a good espresso machine they use and would recommend please please please do a follow up to this video i am currently searching for a coffee machine for home i would also be interested on your thought of bean to cup v grinder and espresso machine great video keep them comming can marc ribillet is hip make a good espresso really enjoyed this video and a others have commented you really must follow it up with similar test at increasing price point a 90 pound espresso machine that is one heavy machine at what point will diminish return became a point what brand is the grinder james hoffman starter kit 499gbp grinder 999gbp filter 129gbp kettle 1 099gbp brewer 4 999gbp espresso machine watching your video calm me so much even though you are politely complaining about stuff most of the time bought 2 delonghi machine 6 year ago one for my parent and one for myself made around 4 8 espresso every single day for 6 year best money ever spent decided to retire one of the two machine this year and move to a bean2cup fully automated delonghi machine a few month ago never moving away from delonghi a they build machine to last i had that krups machine and i thought i just did not know how to brew it correctly useful vid ol make a video of espresso machine under 200 pound i see marc rebillet i press like this guy is the best complaining machine under 10 min i swapped the pressurised filter to a normal filter basket on my breville es800 and the coffee taste much better finally i get nice creamy crema instead of light coloured crema with big bubble ricardo salles resigned from the ministry and now is making espresso review in any hobby you decide to do usually the cheap stuff are terrible you got to love this mr hoffmann can you make a review for sage bambino plus espresso machine i had a similar one by obh nordica in shining red plastic and with milk steamer used it for some week to make caffe latte but then it just stood there could never compeat with the techniworm moccamaster filter coffee machine today i have a nescafe pixie a well for some easy espresso and lungos nice to have before going to work i will stick to my 2 cup brikka pot thank you dollar260 i want the video you mention at the end i currently have a small krupp unit that is not great i would like to upgrade to a better machine but can not justify dollar600 800 dollar i would love to know the grinder and machine you recommend a the bare necessity for making espresso and foaming milk sub would trying to make espresso at home is not a good idea imo for 100 buck euro dollar gbp you can buy decent hand grinder porlex mini f e hario v60 set aeropress french press and kitchen scale and you will get more delicious coffee by far than from these cheap plastic crap someone gave me an older krups and it doe not make anything much different than my bialetti moka pot doe anyone else binge watch these video even though they do not actually like coffee that much doe anyone else binge watch these video even though they do not actually like coffee that much it is not that i do not like coffee i just have not had a lot of good coffee in my life so far i am more of a tea drinker however the tea community doe not provide me with video i can fall asleep to because the person talking help calm my anxiety i love james for that did you tried interchanging filter between delonghi and the first machine hello james i really enjoy your video i really got infected with the home barista virus watching your channel since i always enjoyed coffee and the joy of making it myself i got a gaggia gran deluxe machine which is about 10percent more expensive than these machine ha all of the same problem but i managed to find a coffee grind setting which is finer than preground espresso and made up a routine that get me some really nice shot 50percent of the time the way i get it is that these machine have so small boiler in order to heat up fast that make them really unstable what work for me is to overheat the machine and the portafilter by pressing the steaming button then foam some milk pour some water out of the portafilter in order to get rid of the pressure and then fill it up quickly with 17 18 gram of coffee to about 40gr of espresso shot hope this help some of you enjoy your espresso at home while saving up for a better machine ok my lovely espresso machine is not a good a what i thought yes please keep testing with a little more extra buck although we may be budget sensitive we are aware that a 100 is not doing it i am a potential buyer waiting for your verdict james i have got the krups and it work perfect you have a defective one great espresso maker apparently i need a better grinder and better coffee i certainly can not afford all the toy you have here i am currently working on pour over coffee so now the grinder and coffee are most important if you wanted to send me the good quality coffee i would love to see what i am missing yes please please make a video on what you consider to be a bare minimum for proper espresso and perhaps take into consideration the steam wand a well i am pretty sure all of those especially the delonghi are utter trash i know it s hard and cost money but it would be great to have review of 200 and 300 i m gon na save money for an ok machine but it would be great to know the best espresso machine for a small budget thanks james greeting from mexico good to know so what is the cheapest machine for good espresso with an expensive espresso machine you are paying for style control damage and aggression do a steamee test on those machine i would like to see the quality of milk frothing great video for a person just getting into espresso and the punch line i guess you just poked a hole in the argument that a good grinder can make up for a crappy espresso machine can not wait to see the price point where quality and enjoyment of use move up into next category my actual feeling after purchasing a 100 buck machine it wa fine at start but the hassle of using it just made me store it using a manual espresso machine however is a different story it wa fun making it using the flair now and yeah still fun i can make a great quality shot from my manual flair a well it is well designed and well built i never am able to fully enjoy my shot becasue i am thinking about the mess and the cleaning that i have to do every time i use it and to pull 3 4 shot to dial a bean in involves small part cleaning and preheating between each shot easy enjoyment of use is often underestimated good review by james you buy them for how great they look in the kitchen that is why we bought a smeg expensive doe not work that good but impress people i have krups and a delonghi i could not agree more with you the krups make absolutely the worst coffe i have experienced you can put expensive put whatever you like it will not give more quality shot the delonghi worked well for 2 year before the pump died great video and thanks for sharing your expertise looking forward for your opinion on the bare minimum to have good espresso at home until then i will keep practising on my aeropress unless you are james yes i have an older delonghi ec 155 that i used to cut my espresso teeth on i bought it second hand for dollar40 usd ultimately it wa not a pleasant coffee experience and it seems they have changed little in their latest model i think it wa a great learning tool i learned about extraction dose grind etc i pulled a few decent shot after a year or so i wanted more a better grinder a better machine i could not find a setup that would let me further my learning for under dollar1000 usd so i resigned myself to just enjoying espresso at the shop so no well i got that deloghi used for 15euros guess that wa a very sweet deal then d there are a ton of gaggia model in the 60 100euros range please review 100 300dollar espresso machine if you have time used breville for year but want to upgrade thanks from great video james if your going to review machine in the future i would like to see a comparison of machine in the 500 pound range mine is 2009 caprice palson coffee machine and it still work fine i think yoooooooo love the loop daddy shirt love the detail info you provided any thought about the capresso caf pro just got it and learning a week ago i wa unaware of james a week ago i wa thinking i being cool with one of those in comparison to those who drink instant coffee a week ago i wa still thinking i know something about coffee a week ago my life wa much easier a i wa ignorant about all of this science behind coffee a week ago i wa also richer because i did not feel the need to buy a coffee crushgrind and wa happy to do that with blade a week ago youtube suggested me to watch a video about a guy who is buying coffee stuff from ikea a week later watching 10 of his video a day till 3am thanks james for making my life more difficult but more knowledgeable about something i wa in fact ignorant about  a week ago i had a lot more money before i started buying coffee gear based on james hoffmann vidoes me right now this is going to be me in 12 hr cam hahaha it seems that i got the same example of lady than you lol i have the delonghi and for daily use at home it is quite okay quite curious of the bare minimum machine video looking to continue the series witg under 200gbp machine video thanks for making this video interesting to see the price point across different machine what is the number one espresso machine you would recommend for making espresso at home i watched the video for the krups machine which i have i have now ordered a nespresso inissia i am curious of the quality of the coffee i am canceling my machine order just to wait and hear your thought on the minimum machine to buy for a good good espresso cheer james gaggia classic breville bambino or breville dual boiler seem like the best value machine depending on your need and budget good luck temperature surfing will greatly increase consistency and control with cheap espresso machine the pressurized portafilters collect rancid coffee oil and obscure visual assessment of the shot you must remove them in general pre heat the machine leave it on for a while pull a blank shot this give you a more consistent temperature baseline turn the steam feature on do not release steam just boost the temperature of the water for x second pull a shot taste experiment with temperature surfing until you get a good shot james selfishly because i have one i would love to see your thought on the delonghi dedica ec865 note the basket are pressurised a standard but you can use an unpressurized basket too with a few adjustment much more expensive machine i made a massive mistake and bought it you are absolutely correct in your criticism of the swan it doe not matter what grind you use the po can not you just change the portafilters if so then what happens i have the delonghi with the pressurized filter i can say that i have pulled better shot on it than i have gotten from a few specialty coffee place you must have a very weird idea of what a good shot is i just use the nescafe dolce lumio which wa gbp60 i bought a used braun espresso master 3062 for dollar10 and it work like a charm whats your take on fully automatic coffee machine i ve noticed they practically don t exist on your channel at least here in germany they are what most people who want a decent coffee but not a new hobby read espresso machine use in their home james i want to purchase a home espresso machine what would you recommend sage barista express how much wa the grinder my husband bought that delonghi a couple year ago and like you said late night purchase used for a week and then never again not too long ago though i got a flair espresso maker a nice scale i had a good grinder because we had been making pour over and following your advice i am learning how to dial in shot and make some good espresso i have even managed to revisit coffee that previously id tried brewing in my pour over that never worked but armed with more knowledge wa able to produce some incredibly delicious shot absolutely mind blowing the equipment is very important but really so is the knowledge and patience and thankfully bless you james you have given me knowledge my husband and i are very happy with our espresso now are any of these machine sold or obtainable in the u if you would have to pick another method under dollar100 00 that make an alike espresso which one would you pick how about a moka pot prismo thanks jeff any idea when you plan to release the video you talked about making at the end of this one really curious about your opinion on what the bare minimum would be nice shirt btw would love to see you review the de longhi dedica coffee machine haha i have picked up a rancilio s24 with a cunill flat burr grinder for gbp80 last week however i had to spend approx 5hrs on the s24 to investigate and sort a clog finally today i think matched my favourite caf is espresso quality with it save the world and your wallet and buy used i have this krups machine and it make quite a decent espresso the presentation wa not done properly a this is a cheap machine after all and it take time to warm up along with the filter holder after that the water doe not leak the steam come out properly and with a well adjusted level of quality ground coffee it can be quite good i wish you had done this video about three week ago until recently i had a de longhi scultura that made superb espresso and after a lot of use over about four year it died i wa about to replace it with a similar de longhi when i came across a recent which review that made the swan retro their best buy they put it above the de longhi and other much more expensive machine i made a massive mistake and bought it you are absolutely correct in your criticism of the swan it doe not matter what grind you use the pour time is only about 15 sec which amazingly the which expert thought wa a positive feature it is made from flimsy plastic the coffee basket spin in the holder allowing grind to go under it and into the coffee i could go on a very poor machine meganandoxz the swan machine died after only about 6 month i have never been so happy to have a machine die on me before i now have a de longhi icona very similar to the scultura i am now a happy man again sadly some reviewer do test without knowing the subject they just see that the coffee is coming down without any mess and say oh yeah this machine is great and cheap can not you return it if you are not satisfied or maybe just sell it and buy another one it doesnt have sense to have a machine you do not like it is possible di find some de longhi is like the ec146 depicted here or the 31 21 3521 and so on for about 100euros or the dedica which is a bit better for around 150euros not super machine but if james h say it doe ok coffee is also ok for me d would be interesting to see some video with super automatic machine not a lot to cover but would be super helpful can change only the grind level and water volume in the shot great video looking forward to next video on decent espresso machine i want good coffee and i have a pod system what pod system are the best in your view james can you do a video review on these please a new subscriber and fan thank you this video is what i wa looking for waiting now for the next one cheer the best cheap machine i have used is the mr coffee cafe barista it is decent espresso but the real perk is the well designed cappuccino making feature and yeah f amazon you have all the money in the world yet fail to research and produce an affordable espresso machine for regular people love your channel if i can not come up with the dollar2000 that produce really excellent espresso i will stick with the dollar30 that produce really excellent drip coffee and spend the other dollar1970 on good bean waiting so badly for your recommendation for the bare minimum to have espresso at home please hook u up asap loved the video i think the price is based on each country in my country for aprox 88 95 gbp you can buy the delonghi ecp 31 21 i have that and it seems a bit better that the one in your video keep up the good work because i am enjoying your channel try the crm3605 or it cheaper version the crm3601 for you next series i wish you tested the kmart brand anko machine with these it is dollar89 in australia i believe so probably le in pound i made gbp300 a month when i had a job ehh how about the smeg espresso coffee machine do not have much professional comment about it you are the best reviewer what is your opinion on turkish coffee have you ever had it if it is worth the effort maybe a video about alternative method of preparing coffee thanks my partner and i have the delonghi machine but it ha a pressurized portafilter maybe it is the style for the canadian model we use 12 g of coffee a per the instruction and pull a 40 50 g shot the shot we have been pulling are pretty inconsistent sometimes sour often hollow tasting we are still experimenting though you are spot on with all your other gripe about this machine noisy shaking no temperature gauge etc for u the steaming wand also leak even when we are not steaming with it the only saving grace about this machine is that we got it for free from my coworker haha ok so what is the best budget espresso machine in your eye how about under dollar500 or under dollar400 i have two saeco poemias which i paid dollar75 and dollar53 for list wa dollar150 i am pleased with the coffee i get from them at the time they had the same engine a saecos costing dollar400 no longer in production all the manufacturer of inexpensive espresso are pushing automatic in the u market upvote for james to do a blind test on espresso made on cheap machine v expensive one throw pod coffe in the mix invisiblekid99 s ucxduihato yeah i wa more agreeing and adding to your comment not saying you got anything wrong i think there is also another factor with someone not very well off when something get too expensive you are thinking more about the price than enjoying yourself i think that would be the case with me if i wa drinking something like wine that cost 5 10x what i usually pay i would be thinking too much about how much i can not afford it i think this can even be a little true if someone buy it for you it is the same with say driving an expensive car or using expensive sport equipment you can worry so much about not wanting to ruin it that you forget to enjoy yourself anyway yes to go back to the original point whilst it true that sometimes in blind taste testing there can be surprise i think it also a shame that so many here do not seem to think there are any difference in quality at all you have also got to design the right test of course sometimes something of high quality can only really be told apart when you are having it over a reasonably long period of time rather than from a quick sip let is say i had to distinguish music by beethoven from some amateur composer listening to only 10 second it could possibly be tough listening for 10 minute it would be very easy unless it wa a fantastic amateur i think the same can be generally true in wine and food although i think with coffee and spirit you can often tell straight away if somethings no good ken cur i think one thing though is that with some drink mentioned here spending more doe not necessarily give you nicer because nicer is subjective i think with say whisky spending more give you more complexity and interesting flavour and spending very little can give you some horribly rough and nasty drink but someone favourite drink can easily be the gbp25 30 whisky rather than the gbp60 100 one with other spirit like vodka or gin i find that spending more simply get you a more refined drink that is easier to swallow and more subtle but often spending 4x the money will not get you something that allows you to enjoy your drink 4x more with wine i do not know i do not have enough experience i only ever buy mid to low priced wine and the few time i had better wine it wa nice but not nice enough to justify the cost cheap wine can be horrible but in some country like italy it can also be really very good and by good of course i mean i enjoy it because some people may not and with coffee i agree there are diminishing return and honestly i like a lot of variation in my coffee so i do not care so much about getting everything just right but i agree that sometimes if you get something really crap it is not worth it you might a well get coffee done in an easier way than a cheap and no good espresso it is like people who take a delicious steak and cook it to within an inch of it life fine if you like it that way but why not just have a burger or something in the first place i do not see the point really after reading and watching every single review on the planet i got the delonghi dedica ec685 my budget wa just a bit higher it is available at around 120 to 150 pound locally it came with pressurised basket and after trying out a few preground but expensive coffee i gave up very fast a it all tasted like shit i bought a lelit grinder and a bottomless thingie for the delonghi and now i can do some really nice shot i do not think there is anything better out there for the money but if you can not afford a good grinder i would say do not bother just go for a nespresso machine much love from croatia james now give u some of that beautiful coffee of yours lt 3 peter what kind did you get i have been looking at them and they are kind of pricy i have this too assume you are saying you purchased a depressurised basket and cut out the bottom of a spare portafilter sump i have just done this and result are much better i just discovered you i slipped into the tassimo nespresso mode but wa fed up so ordered an aero press wilfa grinder and a coffee subscription with dog and hat how about a crash course in type of bean and your thought on subscription service for a novice keep up the great vids good video can you make a video on yama glass 6 8 cup cold drip maker i would love to see what your thought are on the end result of the coffee could you please do a review on the smeg ecf01 also i have read you can change the setting temperature flow amp pressure if you know what setting would you suggest for the best extraction we distil our own water amp add celtic salt a a mineral a gram per litre it taste great amp doe not calcify any water heating instrument we use thanks sean i have been waiting for the video on what machine is the bare minimum for a good home espresso experience i would love to see that what is your opinion of the nespresso machine i approve of pun in metacomments we thought we have avoided it and then you did it anyway backhanded perfect i live in mexico so the price for machine like these are inflated and we really struggled trying to buy coffee spec and thing like this i had to save the equivalent to 250 u dl to buy a capresso machine and i get depressed every time i use it porta filter coarse coffee give you awful taste fine coffee will result on the machine not being able to even pump an ounce of liquid and so i am frustrated because then i have to save up to 1500 u dl to get a decent machine and grinder i have a delonghi icona eco310 i think it is pressurised and it is got a tiny 11 12g basket i dislike these factor but it is consistent predictable and make good enough coffee for me in reality though every time i use it i wonder if i should buy a new portafilter basket and shower screen or just upgrade i think this is a crucial behaviour with coffee if you really get into espresso you will almost certainly be upgrading from these machine a james said the machine get relegated to the cupboard i think it would be great to find the machine that are good a first purchase to see if they spark the passion whereas the machine in this video could stifle that spark entirely i had the delonghi and just recently upgraded to an expobar lev the delonghi actually did pretty well when paired with my mazzer super jolly would love to see you review the espressoworks machine i bought the 7 in 1 and can enchant it into making ok espresso with a lot of work would also love to see your reaction to the milk reservoir on the more expensive model i do not even drink coffee what am i doing here i have a mr coffee espresso machine bmvc emc270 best model from mr coffee i doubt it is real espresso but it is constantly good ha a good basket and make good surgery icey drink i have the same krups machine i wanted to help my dad buy a real nice espresso machine because he like to make u his version of a cappuccino on the weekend it is very nice and very tasty however he always get cheap machine that break very quickly for father is day a while back i gave him the choice between three machine around dollar300 dollar500 and i said i would pay half to three fourth of the price a a gift i wa still in high school at the time working a part time job so i could not afford to just buy one for him he ended up ignoring my option and got the krups it is nothing against him i know my dad hate spending money even if it is on thing he like and can afford amazingly he is able to mask the disgusting coffee flavor and make something actually delicious but when i have made more traditional coffee drink or straight espresso it is really gross not sure if my machine doe the weird water funneling thing though hopefully one day he will not cheap out on a machine once the krups dy great video can not wait to see the gbp200 version check out bould brother coffee i have the swan for 3 month now much better then the senseo i had bought not pressurised seef for it and get a decent lungo with lavazza crema bean a channel is not good tampered right the tamper of it suck will get another can not wait to see the next video of this series maybe i did not spend enough money for a honest espresso machine even if my delonghi icona is better than the nespresso crap sage bambino paired with a manual grinder is the cheapest and best combination imo i guess our expectation must be different my wife bought me the swan a a birthday present and it is been my saviour in lockdown it make a better americano than anything i can get in a french press and i can knock out a fairly decent flat white i would love to however have a point of contrast what would you recommend please thank you what happens if you use these for the coarse coffee they were intended for is that in the end better tasting if i wa very rich i would hire justin roiland to dub james hoffman video with his lemongrab voice never thought i would see my cheap delonghi on this channel glad it did the best spoiler alert every time i get tempted by an espresso machine i always come to the same conclusion it is too wasteful for home use unless one drink a lot of espresso at home or ha multiple people consuming it in a shop i feel justified wasting shot to get dialled in just so because i will be delivering far more servable coffee for the wasted coffee especially by monitoring the recipe through the day and consistently making small adjustment before it need to be dialled in with lot of waste but even if i could magically dial in with one shot at home i would still be wasting 1 shot for perhaps 2 4 good shot for me it is not so much the financial element of waste but i feel deeply saddened to pour away the hard work of a coffee farmer if the waste wa not so bad i would be jumping on the espresso wagon so quickly and i would love to hear what people is workarounds to this are if you are not so much passionate about coffee the de longhi ec 146 winner in this video i think is not even sold anymore but is possible to find similar machine like the 3121 ec320 etc i think can be enough for someone who doe not care about texture intensity and so on buying a good coffee in first place is what make you feel the difference i love watching these video not only a a coffee freak but also a a product designer in all of the coffee equipment video james mention so many tiny detail concerning design and handy usage that is just amazing i think every product designer should watch a couple of these thank you james cool i wish i discovered how much i love marketing earlier in life so what is the best option we have in the market for a good home hobby espresso maker what is the amount of money needed for it james what do you have at home the gaggia classic and the rancilio silvia are probably the most legendary hobby espresso maker that can actually deliver restaurant quality espresso at home for a reasonable price please please do delonghi dedica and baratza sette combo what about delonghi dedica i am using it and i think it is ok also what are the cheapest electric coffee grinder i can answer that i am buying an electric right now i will get a wilfa for v60 macchinetta and french press but to grind for espresso i will use my rhinoware hand grinder you should review how to brew coffee with nescafe dolce gusto machine and reusable pod that is also under 100 gbp i think at some point when james conduct a survey of some sort of what kind of content his viewer enjoys the most from the channel he will find that we all kinda enjoy seeing him struggle drinking terrible coffee or testing terrible coffee product i do not even know why myself maybe it is that frustrated response that he show that is so genuine it is delightful great video can not wait to see the gbp200 version james can you review a la pavoni europiccola lever espresso machine please congratulation for your chanel from buenos aire do you ever suffer stomach problem you drank to many coffee i would be very interested in a how to make it work video eg use something not too expensive like a delhongi dedica which is somewhat programable for time etc add a decent tamper and a non pressurised filter include a good grinder and see if it is possible to get near a few thousand pound of outcome a a current owner of a sunbeam espresso machine that cost the australian equivalent of around gbp90 this video is really informative usually you just see people say do not waste your money without explaining why so the actual analysis rather than mere assertion in this is really helpful i would have bought it a my first machine anyway i am pretty low on cash most of the time but now i am aspiring to a rancilio silvia when i can save up can you please send me the delonghi espresso machine i have the swan retro though under the brand name cafe lusso got it a a gift james it made significan notly better espresso after i removed the pressure spring which can be taken out by unscrewing the outlet plate i also just removed the pressured filter in the basket this gave it an even outlet of water and the back pressure from the finely ground coffee wa plenty that said i also do have a sage smart grinder pro which cost three time the machine price i bought this a i heard the grinder is more important than the machine they are all good enough for espresso but do not expect to make latte art with them so what is the best value for money home espresso machine then if it is not from the gbp100 shelf then maybe you can name any from gbp200 or gbp300 group will much appreciate your opinion on those a well the gaggia classic i have sencor 1710 it look like krups but i pull a great shot with it answer to min breville barista express or sage in uk you get the grinder too epsylon88 i love my breville barista express you lip when you talking to trumpi the notion of a future video that look at the bare minimum for good espresso is something i am looking forward to a a home hobbyist barista thanks for always producing what i feel is amazing content and i look forward to your future video thank you i like my frigidaire espresso maker i got it for dollar90 a a work anniversary gift i got to pick something out of a catalog for no money i got a capresso machine quite similar to the 100 pound machine you reviewed i have mucked about with it a lot and i find that once in a while with 12g of nice fresh coffee and a bit of luck i get a good not great shot mostly it is convenient and free wa a good price it is better than capsule coffee and about a convenient i do want to replace it with something worth having but i am not too keen to spend the money just yet looking forward to your price is right review i have a version of the delonghi i think it might be the same but some of the design is different the cup snap into the handle and stay in place not the lever clip version you have like you said it not bad just ok i use it it to make americanos and i enjoy the creme that you do not get by just using a kettle i am super excited to know what you feel the the bare minimum should be then what would be an ideal entry level espresso machine grinder i need some advice i appreciate this video and you so much i did think about getting an espresso machine a while back but i would not want to spend more than dollar100 for it i guess for now it is coffee at home or go out for espresso hi i have been a coffee fan for a few year now and have graduated from the drip coffee machine on to the french press and i wa bought a senseo coffee machine so i bought a coffee duck because i love lot of different type of coffee ie i love javan coffee french roast but hate brazilian coffee i tried lot of different roast and grind till i worked out what i liked people laugh at me because i usually have at a minimum 6 coffee my excuse is that different time different coffee i do not drink alcohol so i just invest in the coffee i like i bought a delonghi next one up from the one you showed recently i decided to invest in a grinder and i bought a ceramic and an electric one i bought some ugandan bean to try i know this is long winded but i want to know if you can re roast bean some say yes others say no super confused now i am only asking because they have been roasted super light and i prefer a darker roast thank you so much because i do not feel i am weird for my love of coffee i have owned similar machine in the past and also gave them to charity much prefer to go to a shop for a proper espresso in my experience making coffee in a bodum french press totally different animal but bear with me i find i can not make good tasting coffee unless i allow the kettle to boil another 14 second past the boiling point this ensures the water is hot enough to make a good cup of coffee is it fair to assume that higher temperature is needed to make a good espresso a well perhaps that is what is wrong with the majority of the machine you reviewed here yes it is called a nespresso machine done lol i know your the espresso gut but how about roasting coffee at home could you review spinn coffee machine who else is waiting for the video featuring the bare minimum required for a decent espresso machine a an experiment i have been trying to get a decent coffee out of my old dualit espressivo gbp160 a few year ago because i wondered the same thing so i replaced the pressurised basket with a delonghi single wall basket and bought a nicer tamper the cheap delonghi grinder i used to use gbp40 wa not up to the task of grinding for espresso so i dialed in some tasty square mile bean on my barista express then ground extra and extracted with the dualit it wa le consistent and did not taste quite a good a with the be but it wa absolutely better after a couple of try than anything i used to make with it using a cheap grinder certainly good enough to make a half decent cafe latte that taste better than anything from costa i will not trade in my be but at least the dualit would work a a backup in an emergency thanks james hello james hoffmann i have recently come across your channel and i have to say i absolutely love it i like your voice your demeanor i like your knowledge about coffee your style and the production of your video i do not drink much coffee but i do like how universal coffee is and how i believe coffee is an experience and should not be rushed one day i hope to be able to make an amazing cup of coffee all by hand i love the thought of explaining the process and sharing with a friend thank you for your video i appreciate them r can you make a review for the hibrew 3 in 1 capsule coffee machine ground nespresso dolce gusto this is exactly the video i needed a friend gifted me an old delonghi that a little broken and at first it wa ok now it is terrible i do not have a good grinder either but the explanation of how the water flow into the porta filter is important and that is what is wrong with the machine thanks i am going to stick to my kalita wave 185 it work for me no let me rephrase that it work for me most of the time what about a kalita wave video length of pour grind consistency temperature to rinse out filter or not and if you wanted to get really controversial you could follow it up with a kalita wave v hario v60 shoot out and the winner play the winner of chemex v a melitta pourover this is all so amusing and stop me buying bad stuff and making me to get the best out all possible coffee situation i have a dollar7 000 s appia and i do not use it because it take 15 minute to warm the f up another great video thanks may i tip you about testing the italian isomac espresso machine 2 25 oh come on james you know you like it hah iwonder if cheap manual espresso maker would be in the next video you planning mr james btw flair is ha a budget manual espresso maker it wa on k for around 70gbp i think the retail price would be around 90gbp it also us pressurized portafilter with an option to a regular portafilter a an add on for around 10gbp would be nice to have another video for machine in the gbp200 bracket and maybe again at gbp300 would be really interested to see what you would class a the better machine for those price bracket correct you are had a delonghi decent espresso frustrating use and where is it in the garage currently have a smeg espresso machine and thinking of upgrading but so unsure on what i should go for sage the duo temp pro espresso seems great but then there is the new sage ses500bss bambino plus coffee machine which is a similar price point what is the grinder you are using can you at least recommend some good cafe is for coffee in london coming from australia all the coffee is here taste horrible great video but wa wondering which machine are good in a mid range price point gbp250 gbp400 like most thing these day there seems to be a big grey area between budget and high end speaking personally is it possible to get a great complete set up for sub gbp500 looking forward to the next round of test welp i agree that the shape is not good have you ever considered doing a video of like the top 5 or 10 bean coffee you can get at the store aldi walmart ect i live on a limited income but i want good coffee i can afford what is the cheapest combination grinder machine etc to get an acceptable espresso to your standard hi james you should review the kamira espresso machine i had a somewhat older delonghi but similar in build and style to the one listed here the best thing i can say about it wa that it wa an interesting way to learn about espresso and i did have a lot to learn about the basic and about general machine maintenance and i even jury rigged an unpressurized portafilter and got some decent shot out of it but ultimately when my skill were a bit better i still could not get reliably good result and it wa difficult to clean and maintain i switched to aeropress for a long while then recently i got the flair on a bit of a whim and i have really enjoyed using it it scratch the itch of occasional espresso without large investment of money counter space or maintenance that is all to say that i tried for a long time to be content with a machine in this price range but ultimately i recommend against it i have also started recommending against home espresso in general unless you are already pretty familiar with coffee and cheaper brewing method to make concentrated coffee i think most people would be much better served by an aeropress or a moka pot i agree 100percent with the last suggestion of just getting an aeropress of moka pot the price value ratio is going to be league higher than any espresso machine i love really strong concentrated coffee and so i use my moka pot basically every day if i want real espresso i can just go to an amazing caf in my city and get an espresso that will 100percent be better than anything i could get at home without pouring so much money and effort into james wearing a marc rebillet shirt lt 3 james could you review the little guy it is a stovetop espresso maker with a built in steam wand the irony is also that the grinder wa 4 9x the cost of all of these machine wondering if buying a non pressurised basket to fit in these would make them better i have been considering that for my cheap breville thought a an owner of a cheap machine thank you looking forward to your search of bare minimum machine that are enjoyable to use i have had a de longhi for a few year wa a gift after hour and hour of youtube and experimenting i found it best to heat it for 45mins run hot water through the machine and empty filter pod then and only then you can get a decent cup so my machine is still new it just so much work french press for daily coffee i am glad my delonghi brand wa at least at the top i have the next level up version and am slowly moving into making espresso every morning it is been a good first lil machine i have a capresso ec100 i purchased from costco membership wholesale club in u for dollar99 seems to be very comparable to the delonghi you used in this video i find the machine capable but of course lacking in the kind of functionality needed to really dial in a precise brew ratio could be a good option for folk looking to have espresso espresso based coffee drink on a budget what is the grinder you are using correct you are had a delonghi decent espresso frustrating use and where is it in the garage i want this guy to review my life i just know when he explains how miserable i am i will not be ready  james espresso machine below gbp100 me how sanity look like at below euros100 my hat off to your bravery sir these thing are largely responsible for people thinking they do not like coffee imo i recently bought the amazon cheapo and i either pack hard a i can or leave it loose so the coffee all swirl about it better than mr coffee drip lol so how cheap can you go and get a decent cup my guess is a delonghi machine at one point i had a kitchenaid flower grinder which gave me a very precise grind shape that make me slightly uncomfortable hold dildo tamper just buy a moka pot and a baratza sette 270 il save you the time no no you can not there is a reason decent one cost 10k my god i fell asleep zzzzzzz do turkish coffee please thank you i am really looking forward to seeing what minimum threshold will get me to good espresso consistently currently use an aicok machine similar to the delonghi featured here swapped out the filter basket with a non pressurized one i bought on ebay and the steam wand on it is all metal with a single hole i pull decent shot inconsistently and can make tasty latte is with good microfoam and art family is satisfied but i miss the consistent result i used to get on my commercial machine when i owned my coffee shop oh grinder is a baratza vario on that price point would you mind reviewing the new flair neo i received mine yesterday and am pretty happy with the result if you an get your hand on a used la pavoni get t and learn b hartmann i want one of those so badly but they are dollar1 200 and up i have a simple coffee machine philip saeco poemia hd8325 it also come with pressurized filter in it is default state it is unable to work with espresso grind especially properly tampered the pressure is just not enough to go through both coffee and valve underneath but valve can be removed and it turn into a basic but decent coffee machine yes it doe not have pid or temperature control or a separate boiler for foaming milk that said it pull some very nice espresso shot i bought an older krups unit about 15 or more year ago and i remember that it wa difficult to make consistent brew and like mentioned in the video only worked with coarse or pre ground coffee which wa fine at the time i have had a saeco super automatic espresso maker for about 4 year and i have really liked it i just did a full service on it a few month ago my only complaint with the saeco is that it is a bit tedious to clean coffee ground tend to get in all the crevasse and it a bit hard to get them all out i would be interested in a video covering how much money one must spend to get a machine that will make proper espresso you might do one video for manual option and another for electric i would love to see you review the capresso ec pro it is dollar225 i think a friend of mine that work a a barista at a local cafe raf about it at it particular price point jeff kaplan at it again 8 00 can you do another video with u dollar please we used to have a krups at home but it must have been a more expensive one i remember it to be very well made and it did make some delicious coffee yes please i want to know which coffee machine you recommend for amazing coffee how much should i be investing for a bit i could be lazy and buy starbucks capsule but what i really want is a decent set could you recommend a great or amazing grinder and espresso machine please you can get decent espresso from delonghi especially when you cut off the bottom of porta filter and make it bottomless krups is crap james hoffmann when you find the most affordable machine that perhaps with some minor design change could produced acceptable espresso experience why not chat to the manufacturer of that machine to affect said improvement and re launch it a the most economical good espresso machine according to you design rescue a it were r p ter horv th rocking my pre 2015 and i can confirm the community support is brilliant they offer help on everything from dialling in to full rebuilds or just fancy mod p ter horv th gaggia classic lt 3 wa my first machine cause it doe exists already james started with that too the gaggia classic pre 2015 or the cheaper plastic but identical sibling like baby gaggia also decent community with load of doable open source upgrade can not wait for the you are cheap but not gbp100 cheap video 6 24 i have had the same problem by putting in too big of a dose maybe you should have tried with le coffee great review would love to see more of those i wa looking at all of those machine at one point but opted to spend a little more on the sage bambino plus will you be doing a video about that model i would love to learn more about it and how to get the best out of it what is the best budget say sub 250 machine anyway i have got a delonghi dedica purchased for gbp120 but currently gbp150 a great little machine like what you said it make a hobby out of making espresso broadly unpleasant like when your parent say i am not mad just disappointed what is your recommendation for espresso machine in the gbp300 400 500 mark perhaps a video on that would be extremely useful for me at least looking at the sage duo temp or bambino which seem like they would be good choice from my research but be useful to know your opinion for espresso machine in that price range i have a version of the swan almost identical but it ha a different brand slapped on it it is alright i do not drink straight espresso usually a milky whatever and it is perfectly drinkable coffee i can say the steamer is lacklustre it is difficult to make nice even frothy milk and you get a lot of bigger bubble but it is better than the drip machine that i had before and it make coffee well enough that the bigger variable is the actual coffee i use another thing to note i found that it make a better cup if you hit go immediately when the ready light come on if you leave it a minute or so after it is ready you can end up with an almost cigarette like flavour even though it say the temperature ha not changed we also have the de longhi at work and it is just a much better steamer it doe really good frothy milk imo however i have found that it is much le consistent than the swan in the actual coffee it produce and the attached tamper is absolute dogshit why they thought that wa a good idea is beyond me if you try to make 2 cup at once you have to clean off the tamper first or you get a nice layer of grit from the godawful vibration the damn thing practically dance across the table but we got it for free and it trump instant i have a 45 usd espresso machine buy my cheap coffee pre grinded and my espresso are delicious yeah it wa a joke here my favorite coffee it is marley but it too expensive to sustain drinking it on a daily basis and also i can not get the same flavor from my cheap machine that my local brewery get but with that said from my first 20 cup on that machine till the one i pulling this day there is a huge difference even if it do not ha pressure or temp controller you can still learn to control it to a quit good degree just by timing and playing with the little you get everyone ha their own taste i suspect some might not agree i thought the coffee that came out of my old cheap machine wa good until i splashed out on a good machine and freshly roasted bean and realized that i could never go back i think i will just stick to my aeropress but is any one of them worth buying over that aldi espresso machine looking forward for this video please make more especially on nespresso machine and nescafe machine after hearing james bashing this machine i have the feeling that i will be able to mantain my coffee taste by the time i am 35 or maybe older so for now i will wait and hope that my name get picked either for the delonghi or the swan retro finger crossed i have a delonghi but not the one you used it is more similar to the others with the pressurised portafilter having worked in a few coffee shop it is one of the most frustrating experience of my life especially since i did not really understand how the pressurised portafilter wa designed to take coffee not only is the espresso horrible to taste but if it wa too fine going in it quickly clog that tiny pinprick hole and any subsequent shot will just clog even when i wa pulling drinkable never good shot it could only cope with a single attempty before it needed to be fully cleaned out and a needle used to clear the plug i look forward to seeing a video on good home espresso machine because it can be so difficult to understand what i am buying when i can not see it in front of me am i going to pay through the nose just for a brand name am i getting something that look like it make espresso but really is only designed to sit on the counter and look pretty i wish i had not wasted my money on this one and i look forward to seeing what you think is a worthwhile second attempt thanks for all the great content i got the delonghi for very cheap gbp50 5 year ago and ha done me well and made me want to learn more about making coffee that said i am giving it away to a friend after lockdown since i now have better way of brewing coffee really looking forward to the next video very interesting recently got a old saeco philip 5000 from si in law learn to appreciate coffee the right way then the filter holder spoilt i dissembled checked confirm spoilt is there a way to salvage the machine without the handle i am doing ok with the delonghi ec685 even though it ha a pressurized filter i will hack it to have a non pressurized one james is working to answer the question i always cringe when receiving because i never have the answer what is the most budget friendly home espresso machine that can make great espresso a true coffee hero james could you do a review of the best expresso machine for the lowest cost possible or recommend one if you know one already but the channeling is no more i also bought an unpressurized basket off of amazon that deja brew dad joke tho a legend hi james have you ever tried the gaggia new classic espresso machine it is more expensive but still pretty affordable wa curious if you have any thought about this one will be great to know your option on breville cafe rom for dollar180 i have found at least 4 entry level model of gaggia under the 100 euro mark point moreover i think it would be a better video if ypu only chose let say 2 machine or one even and show how you can get the best result possible out of it by using a good tamper playing with the grind size the ammount of liquid replacing the presssurized porta filter with a normalbasket etc i have never understood the appeal of spending so much money on a device that is going to be so potentially faulty a pain to use an even bigger pain to replace the part for having said that not a high level enthusiast more just a slightly picky caffeine addict i prefer a french press and to have my bean ground weekly at the cafe fail safe and decent and minimal effort must add it is a shame that someone like jeff would take something so faulty and waste so many resource to produce a cheaper version of the same crap it is taking advantage of our well meaning desire to level up only to end in frustration and waste of time and money love the marc rebillet shit james what is the name of that grinder i have one de longui dedica since 2018 and i would like to chance would you recommend me a new one i love espresso coffee and usually i work from home if you only have the budget for these kind of machine it is better to hold off your purchase and improve your manual brewing skill i would listen to you reading harry potter all day to the end quote about finding the best espresso machine for home use i think i have found it the ascaso dream pid please test it though something tell me you are gon na land on the silvia for the lowest possible cost looking forward to the bare minimum video prop for the reb t shirt what expresso coffee machine can i buy under gbp200 e g gaggia ri8323 is just gbp30 40 more than this delonghi is it better than de longhi the cheapest sage are the duo temp pro and bambino plus it is worth for gbp400 i had a delonghi it wa okay but after a while we lost all interest and reverted back to the usual american sock juice hmm i have that krups maschine price wa 30euros in sale for that monney is greate it do not make sludge like yours but for 120euros 100gbp i buy delonghi dedica and it is mutch better for use and coffe is mutch better too if you have 100gbp buy dedica oh that steam watter problem on krups is when you make first steam and then coffe hey james is there a gbp101 gbp200 range or gbp101 gbp300 could you review the delonghi dedica thanks james for thinking about u and looking into cheaper espresso machine waiting for a reasonable machine which make good coffee also telling u which grinder is best for that particular machine and also waiting for my requested machine philip series 1200 2200 3200 automatic coffee machine any of those a the espresso part is the same will be great to know your option on breville cafe rom for dollar180 will be great to know your option on breville cafe rom maybe call it kraps instead of krups good idea i am waiting for more video like that and the best espresso coffee machine by james hoffman also i am glad i did not buy any of cheap machine a i wa tempted few year ago seems to be very frustrating for daily usage love your channel james i have a rocket espresso machine and a good grinder too at home and i did not realise how much i did not know about making good coffee james seems ultra relaxed in this video i do not hate it i wa drinking instant coffee for year then i allowed myself to buy an unnecessary thing cheap delonghi machine probably an earlier model of this one and that ha definitely changed my daily morning experience i would say it is the best 100 euro i have spent in my life if divide it by the overall experience through year it is a bit weak a if coffee is too course it can get broken i have figured out pre ground coffee my local supermarket chain import from portugal and it seems to be the best fit for this machine also i do not make milk drink a i do not feel very well when drinking fresh milk so my experience is just about plain black coffee you can get out of my little delonghi is it the ec155 best budget machine for year and very similar to the one in this video hi james my delonghi ha a metal clip that lock the portafilter taste ok can not complain much for the price hello james an idea for a video maybe you could also consider testing and exploring some capsule machine and capsule the new trend is a i see that more and more speciality roaster offer their capsule also a for me i am also a big fan of the refillable method with a special capsule excellent review james i have been there before 10 year ago when i first starting buying my first espresso machine i just use 5 time and i give it away but that is what we call a process we have to go through all this whole process that make u more informative i really like this kind of video james hope to see your next video soon for sure watching james video are a bit of a double edged sword though i feel like i know a lot more but the price barrier seems much higher a well like maybe i would have bought one of these machine and at least have experimented a bit but now i feel like i have to get something pretty expensive for it to be worth the bother although it seems a lever espresso maker is the best option and i am saving for a cafelat robot thanks jeff so which machine for the home would you recommend have you tried sealpod refillable nespresso pod it is a good hack for a nespresso machine they are stainless steel and work decently to my untrained palate james hoffman what is your opinion on jura is pulse extraction process doe it fail a miserably in pulling classic espresso shot a pressurised portafilters do thanks looking forward to the follow up video to see what is the minimum for good quality espresso keep up the good video hey james what about flair espresso have you tested those around dollar150 300 manual single shot espresso machine i wa very surprised to hear that the delonghi wa the winner i have that brand just a different one the one i have is okay it defective and i am able to pull shot i am happy with i just know the next machine i am getting i will def be twice a expensive because every video i watch of yours is making me snobbier and snobbier about my coffee i loved this video you made me laugh several time looking at these machine make me happy that i chose a rocket apartamento for my own even if it take forever to heat up also watching your video make me try harder to make a better espresso i think i went through half a pound just dialing in my grinder to optimize my espresso shot thank you for your video omg feel like i won in choosing the best for dollar79 96 usd on sale i purchased a de longhi ec155 dollar100 reg price at the time may 2019 i had received my barista certificate the year prior and wanted to keep practicing of course i wanted the breville barista express the engine red one would have been nice but i wa starting out so did not plunge the dollar550 usd the de longhi ec155 wa actually what i truly needed to get started and followed the tried and true advice of getting a great burr grinder which i also bought on special for dollar79 95 oxo brew conical burr coffee grinder highest amazon rating at this price point the combination of the two ha been absolutely great both at below dollar200 can not compete with commercial machine in coffee shop but you do get great coffee i get to enjoy the ritual and offer my friend coffee in the morning a well agree with review it is not perfect basket noisy bought solid aluminum tamper do not use the built in one shake but at this price point i have nothing but praise this combo is solid reliable and dependable this is what i want early in the morning i have no doubt i will move up the chain but very satisfied i started on the right foot and for le than dollar200 for grinder and machine one of the best value combo you can find imho waiting for the bear minimum choice machine great video hahahaha 2 24 i have a spidem villa espresso machine and i wish james would someday review it and help me make the best espresso out of it lt 3 if they are so horrible how come you have affiliated link listed in the description box if you believe some will benefit and purchase these then perhaps show more respect while critiquing because not everyone is attracted to coffee snobbery professional opinion wa what i came for thank you mental thought it is amazing how much people love snobbery the comment are glorifying it sheesh i sure hope the yellow one win because it is so aesthetically pleasing because i do not hate you or me rolling i have never made it through a james hoffmann video without pausing it and and going to the kitchen to make a tall iced americano on my breville barista express i have tried many machine and process over the year and can not see any reason to ever down grade my espresso making experience i have an aeropress and hand grinder for when the power go out i think the flair at around 160 pound or flair neo from indiegogo at 90 pound may be the cheapest good espresso machine if you are not adding milk today i tried a cold pressed espresso on my flair and i am blown away with how easy and good it wa james could you do a video on cold pressed espresso with the various option out there with my flair i ground a bit finer than usual used cold water pre infused for 3 minute then extracted for 1 minute with a great result i am sure the cafelat robot and other manual espresso machine would be just a capable love knowing the info about the machine but also really loved knowing that james is a fan of marc what camera and lens doe he use look forward to finding out what the bare minimum is for a god daily experience i wonder if a pump accumulator and waste tank littered about the kitchen is a prerequisite cause that is where i am at i have really grown to like this channel at first i got a kind of upper class twit of the year vibe from it but i wa wrong i see the humour in it now i have the swan like machine rebranded here in jakarta a oxone 213 an impulsive buying at the local supermarket lol initially it wa tasted so so and hollow but after experimenting with a right grind size and using a proper tamper i found out it is actually not that bad it is also worked better with a blend of arabica robusta or darker roast rather than with single origin or lighter roast bean the filter size seems similar with rok is so probably i am going to try with the naked filter someday capresso ec pro cheap enough not a lot of plastic come with a bottomless portafilter no frill i attempt to make espresso with a cheap 90 krups machine is there any way to make the water shower more even there a re a few stream like the one machine in this video i have already cleaned the screen and it did not help much overall can you please do a review of the sunbeam torino is is a great entry level machine mid range or neither what i would really like to know is if james can tell the difference between these with blind taste testing i have my doubt p great review i would like to see one about nespresso is reusable capsule a you know not all of u can afford the real thing nowadays thanks in advance can you review this or the coffee jack portable coffee maker hilarious contraption thanks for this i have the delongi machine and always wondered what value for money i got soo what machine would you recommend outcome expected there are now quite a number of machine between these guy and pro sumer unit however that have proper basket and reasonable showerhead eg breville duo temp which may not be uk available but is about dollar350au here a look at those a entry level espresso viable or not might be a good review to do it is a deja brew have a look at the sage barista express can we get a review of the delonghi dedica or sage bambino a you do more espresso machine i hope you might be able to include a crossland cc1 v 2 0 it is a single boiler machine with a thermoblock and pid temp control seems like it may be good value for money but it is made in america by a small business it might be hard to get outside the u s this is my ultimate question i am so glad your going to cover it can not wait for future installment cheer 1 for bare minimum i would really appreciate that thank you i have had 2 of those delonghi machine around 15 year ago the coffee wa ok a long a you threw the first cup of the day away that would always taste stale another issue wa a spring operated ball that would keep it from leaking wa piss poor quality and would lose it is springyness pretty quick and then there wa always a puddle of liquid on the counter this last thing and coffee grind everywhere made my wife force me to throw it away and get a senseo please review the rancilio silvia i have had mine for 7 year and think it pull some amazing shot with my mahlkonig vario but would love to hear your opinion please look at bezzera magica i would love to have your take on it i had the delonghi for a little while a a starter machine which i suppose wa okay i quite quickly lost patience with the mess and the mediocre result at best i am much happier with my sage machine and sage grinder i recently brought i have a gaggia classic that i bought in 2003 refurbished for gbp195 i have been making at least 2 flat white a day ever since and it is still going strong only needing one service i use a hario hand grinder and while my set up perhaps can not compete with professional machine for home use it is more than adequate and considering the number of baristas that are not properly trained i find that my coffee is more consistent than risking a bad one at a coffee shop with a few exception of course i have got that delonghi ec155 and felt a bit deja brew here hehe salam kopi someone tell this guy to either review pricier option or curb his expectation enough with the whining i have bought the middle class model from solis the barista grand gusto typ 101 about half a year ago very stable machine make very good espresso and is all metal but set you back around 400 euro and a grinder for 160euros please include delonghi dedica unpressurised filter bought separately in your bare minimum search video kind regard fellow bare minimalist two thing about james i could not guess 1 his profession he look like a doctor and sound like an automotive designer 2 his age look like something between 35 and 70 vishnubhrama shiva according to google so you know it is gospel he wa born in 1979 so 42 a of 2021 like number 999 you literally described everyone from the uk sas3dx totally agree grinder brand anyone know please it is like you knew it i wa browsing for an espresso machine thank u thank you very much for doing this video i have spent the last 5 day researching the best espresso machine to buy for under 200 dollar so far had narrowed it down to the breville cafe rom thank you specially for doing the group head shot i have every other method except espresso can not really go to any coffe shop because i do not like what i get compared with i can do at home i live in the dominican republic my grandfather wa a coffee exporter use coffe from a very good specialty roaster from 3 good coffee farm i will wait for the next video on best budget machine before comitting thank you yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees you made it i have wished for it for a long time i am guessing that if someone only had 100pounds the best recommendation would be to buy a moka pot and start saving for a more expensive espresso machine perhaps a good question is how much money doe it take to consistently do better than a moka pot i do realize that a moka pot only make very strong coffee and not espresso but it might be a good bar for a cheap machine thank you for your great video could you do a video on the sustainability around coffee growing a a consumer is it enough that we buy fairtrade coffee are there coffee bean from a particular type of growing practice that we should support thank you much please do another video maybe dollar200 price point and hopefully you would recommend one i almost bought a version of the swan retro but by a different name and decidet to save up a bit more and get a better one boy am i glad i did that yes please continue these video i need to know what is the minimum cost for a machine that pull great espresso that color correction undone at 8 57 haha thank you james for this video i made the move to pour over coffee about six month back and it ha changed my daily coffee drinking lifestyle but i have always still enjoyed drinking a latte cappuccino and want to eventually buy an espresso maker for home i wa always weary of getting a machine that is focused on being the budget maker just based on review this video really validated my suspicion and it would be great for you to do another video on the dollar100 dollar199 dollar200 299 etc until you find some decent machine that you approve of that are worth the price year ago i had the top of the line delonghi it wa much better than what you have there but not spectacular james follow this on with a test of sub gbp250 machine and then sub gbp500 machine would be great to have some differing machine in differing price band please include delonghi dedica unpressurised filter bought separately in your bare minimum search video kind regard fellow bare minimalist could you do a review your approach to the la pavoni europiccola when i wa doing some research to get a good machine but not too expensive one the gaggia classic kept popping a a good initial long term investment it is still in the 400 500 range but at least you get pressurized and unpressurized basket 58mm portafilter and it is very reliable and durable love this yes let is find a good machine for espresso amateur thx for the great video have you ever come across home coffee roaster ikawa pro seems to be a really interesting machine that people can actually use it to roast very small batch of coffee at home regularly or just sample some new green bean it would be great to see you review one if you are interested james i absolutely love your channel it is rare to find someone who know this much about espresso i only drink black espresso that is my type of coffee i got a breville barista express with a built in grinder and it is always a bit hard to find the right grind point a well a the amount of coffee i only buy specialty coffee freshly roasted i get really good coffee but i feel like my shot are a bit inconsistent not sure if you have it already but a video on how to get a perfect espresso shot regardless of what your machine is that would be great gon na go to your video now and search for something like this keep up the amazing work love coffee video that are informative like this i wonder why james did not include any manual espresso machine in this list seems like dollar for dollar you can get a much better espresso with a manual espresso machine looking forward to the bare minimum video right now i am using a moka pot for my fix i bought a gaggia baby second hand for gbp60 it wa barely used and ha the internals of a gaggia classic with updated milk frother movent 9 00 is the best direction to take many thanks in advance i had one from lidl which look like a frankenstein version of the first one same plastic tamper same display same issue horrible experience what grinder is that found it it a niche zero but i will have to pas at gbp499 a pop i have that delonghi machine it make coffee i have never really enjoyed the espresso from it but i have made latte and cappuccino from it the milk frother is not very good though i have not used in in age preferring to use my v60 i do want to invest in a decent machine someday though somehow that calm cool voice reminds of someone from the hundred acre wood and that spoon with the swan i have an exact one oh so that wa supposed to be a tamper looking forward to the video that you will be making i love your review james honest with a large chunk of sarcasm can not wait to see more espresso machine review i really want to buy one but i do not have enough money right now so these video help me a lot cheapest good option is a used la pavoni dollar300 and you have a machine that will last a lifetime pulling shot a great a the effort you are willing to put in hello james i have a question is there a way to get a good cup of coffee from a smaller amount of ground coffee in an aero press the recommended ratio just seem so high i am just wondering if there is a way to get more out of what i have and not be so wasteful now test the delonghi with supermarket espresso excited for the minimum spend machine review just can not choose at the moment aaaaagh three to choice pavoni lever simonelli oscar or rancilio silvia i have a delonghi vintage i bought when i got into coffee 3 year ago after 6 month i cut up the portafilter optional and installed an unpressurized basket it pull mostly fine shot now i drink almost exclusively cappuccino so even after 3 year it is what i use i will upgrade to something e61 when this break down you should not use 12gram use between 16 17 gram the result will be way better that marc rebillet shirt i do not know a lot about coffee but i really like your voice have you considered bean to cup machine the de longhi line spring to mind forgot to stir redo rocking a marc rebillet shirt dig it also good info i so wanted to be surprised by this video and find a cheap decent espresso machine guess i will just keep saving i am looking forward to your next review i had spent about dollar400 plus another dollar150 for accouterment and wa wholly unsatisfied gave the machine to my nephew i have no problem spending that much or even double for something that is worth it looking forward to that next video you are talking about looking forward to seeing more on this quest for the best at home espresso experience there is one other aspect to this test longevity kindly request the end user to report to you in case it fails on them sencor s 1710bk p kov k vovar na espresso latte a capuccino my mom bought some machine really simillar to amazon basic from lidl for about gbp100 in 2014 6 year later it still make horrible coffee but never broke down or had any other problem although since i bought her moccamaster for the same price of ebay she start really enjoy her morning coffee instead of just use it a wakeup shot i have won at my job christmas party the delonghi machine i have never onwed an espresso machine but over the last six month i have started taking more and more of a liking to making them i am most likely going to invest more in the future to get better result a i get more knowledge about those thing respect for representing marc with the t shirt bought this one on sale had good review and wanted it for learning my way into espresso before committing to something more expensive i get 1 good espresso cup out of 20 try still got a lot to learn hej james i would love to hear your opinion about the bellman espresso amp steamer cx 25p look like an interesting concept i have a delonghi scultura which doe not make good coffee so i tried with roc gc and roc grinder and after a week i sent the roc gc back and kept the grinder moved then to a flair pro 2 and so far i am enjoying the process of making my own tasty espresso for wife and myself a well a many good tasty coffee i enjoyed red brick coffee but i am now experimenting different others from local northern irish roasteries all of these thanks to james hoffmann can you review a machine with a milk frother had a bit of friction with coffee reddit when defending my aldi ambiano no one would believe that you can get cheap machine without pressurised pfs on a diff note i think part of the fun is making the best you can with the tool you have available i miss raf make some of the design were inspired still working on my set up involving a salad spinner for distributed extraction amp a bike pump to build up pressure xd marc rebillet is just such a cool guy i bought the swan machine to experiment with early this year with the included pressurised basket james is right it pull pretty average shot however with a cheap 51mm double non pressurised basket online a few dollar delivered it work surpringly well it can fit maximum 20g of coffee and i am able to extract 40g in 28 second and it taste amazing all coffee goodness and no bitterness it easily pull double ristretto i e 20g of coffee to extract 20g or le in 28 second recently i got a spare portafilter and converted it into a bottomless the extraction pressure flow and temp guage from this machine is really good once you have a non pressurised basket for the price once you have figured this out it is a no brainer rcc rt thanks marleen i got mine from ebay where did you buy the non pressurised basket i could easily beat you up i have ha a similar de longhi for about 10year which i use regularly i make pretty good coffee and still work great i have always fancied a rancillio silva but not sure if they are any better for the price i would like to see review on it if you have one i am curious if you could take one of these machine or a similar breville and buy non pressurized portafilters to improve their consistency i would challenge you to take the lowest level breville and get third party filter basket portafilters etc to try improve it a much a you think possible i started with a breville cafe rom that we won from a work contest i enjoyed it but it wa very inconsistant i then saved up enough money too get the breville barista express love the machine but some day i would like to get something more refined i look forward to my espresso latte thing i do and enjoy drinking and sharing them would like to see what the next machine i should get thanks for the great video i really like this series because i have been thinking of getting an espresso machine for about a year at least i contemplated the de longhi one a it is really one of the only one i can find where i live that is not omg expensive and actually make espresso coffee in my area is really expensive and i can not afford going to a cafe every day also i do not know why many espresso machine in asia just make normal filter coffee it is like it is cheap it look pretty it look like an espresso machine but once you dig into the detail you realise it is not and it make normal filter coffee it is like a fake tinder profile that lure you in and then serf you disappointment i am very interested in the baseline espresso machine that you are researching for thank you so much for the great content james the second question is exactly the one that i would like to know thank you for all the work care and content i fucking love how the title is can you get good espresso for under gbp100 instead of which machine make the best espresso for under gbp100 so basically he beforehand assumes the espresso will most likely be bad classic james classic james i m excited to see which machine will make the win regarding price to taste ratio the power button that doe not stay in is a feature such that the appliance can turn off after a time of inactivity in eu for instance this a legal requirement what brand is that grinder can you use the non pressure basket in any of the others 51 non pressurized basket are readily available the others a bit trickier to find wa wondering also if a few simple mod would make them any better ie dimmer switch pressure gauge so it doe not pump so hard with the non pressure basket i could draw you up a simple schematic that would allow you to control the pressure from the pump or you could simply use a light dimmer if you have no soldering equipment plus better thermostat all are rather cheap mod not more than dollar50 wa pretty interested in the swan a a project since i think it actually ha a boiler in it not sure of the diameter of the porta filter though really looking forward to what you would recommend a the bare minimum or there roundabout for a home espresso machine hey james i have a similar machine from mesko i just bought a tamper and an unpressurised filter and now my espresso got pretty good for 100euros i am no expert like you but it taste good to me it even make decent espresso from lighter roast coffe like la cabra or coffee collectif i have an older krups that wa gbp60 in 2007 it is probably more like the delonghi and being used to it now i can make a reasonable cup with it using pre ground but i have to find the sweet spot for each type of coffee i have a blade grinder wa a gift and hope to upgrade to a burr a it can be frustrating and inconsistent but if i have more time i can get a good grind my problem is that the krups doe not like coffee ground too fine since i changed the gasket and i do not know if it is because it need grease to seal it properly what is your experience with sage the bambino plus espressomaker is it worth money can you review the delonghi delica pump express coffe machine because a i have seen it might be a value for money though i have recently gotten some decent result using 21g filter basket to allow a slower pressure build during the brew anyone tried this one how do we know if the machine maybe can produce a good espresso if we want to buy is there are any indication or something mijuo roui i have one aeropress a good cup of coffee is coffee that you like if a cheap machine make coffee that you enjoy then the machine is good irrespective of the price a review should be done with an open mind a reviewer should not have already made up his mind before reviewing the product thank you for your informative and well done video i have been watching a lot of video on espresso machine a of late and welcome the information and delivery you offer looking forward to watching the rest of your content thank you and stay safe ive been through 2 andrew james machine at a point when we needed one and wa limited money at the time they all broke down leaking water or backing up they got sent back one got tossed in the bin currently using a machine made by a american company called delta work a treat paid gbp10 for it wa new too totally unused must have been a return or something dejabrew give the people what they want there is a cook professional mr coffee machine that sold for gbp45 dollar45 it would be really interesting to get your take on that i think alot more sin is excusable when you only have to make 15 espresso to save money i would love for you to review and demonstrate how to get the best out of a sage barista express i really like this video generally you are smashing the knowledge of coffee brewing all the time but this video made the comparison of espresso machine down to earth really nice would you say it is better than the gbp70 bellman stovetop espresso and steamer you need a real job badly linus level are crap level i would have to disagree slightly regarding the user experience with a de longhi my first machine wa a de longhi ec155 and the machine you tested look very similar in every way the ec155 had a pressurised filter but i replaced it with a bottomless non pressurised basket granted the coffee wa not great and wa just ok a you have said but i enjoyed learning to use it getting the grind right tamping etc and a decent shot felt like a bit of an achievement i think i appreciate what is good about my current setup because of having started with a more challenging machine making espresso in general is laborious even with good equipment i would suggest anyone getting into it start with a cheaper machine to see if they enjoy the process a much a the end product before spending big looking forward to seeing the cheapest enjoyable espresso machine you can recommend hi james what is your opinion of the gaggia new classic i have heard a lot of good thing about it and rating are consistently positive but at 400euros it is of course not a cheap investment but maybe absolutely worth it if it brings me joy every day of the month i guess i am at that point where i just need a little nudge to finally decide to buy it looking forward to your new series of trying out different espresso machine at different price point like some others below have commented i have a similar terrible machine a little modding many many trial and error and a pressurised basket purchase and it work my issue is i have nothing to really compare it to is it better than coffee from any cafe chain nearby yes is it good no idea i bought some of your sweetshop coffee a while back and managed maybe 2 ok coffee from it it wa hugely disappointing after the initial aroma from opening the bag blame levelled squarely at the equipment really looking forward to your bare minimum setup a decade ago my mum found a la pavoni europicola for sale on ebay for gbp100 someone in belgravia probably bought it on a whim only to find their child is nanny could not use it properly so they returned to a nespresso lucky for me a i got a nearly new machine for the price of the tat you just reviewed it might have taken most of the next decade for me to make a decent coffee on it but i am there now please review a lp wa the delonghi dedica tested i have been using a similar sort of espresso machine for age it is a hand me down and i can not even find the manual for it online i have found it is best when making some sort of faux aeropress i do not think i will ever be able to afford an espresso machine but i did just save up and buy a semi good grinder and can not wait for it arrive so i can make yummy fresh french press coffee for a treat at the weekend be sure to use manual in your quest for the best minimum espresso machine say i who pair a flair with a niche zero i watched the whole thing with interest while having a gbp1800 machine in the kitchen p mad poop for the marc rebillet t shirt for not much more than these i would recommend a manual machine like the rok although there is a process to getting great consistent espresso it relies on you far more than the equipment that for this price point will never deliver once you have got a technique down with a manual machine like these you can make coffee that far exceeds machine of a similar price point nice that you rated the delonghi highest i got a used ec 155 for gbp40 i upgraded the steaming tip and got the unpressurised basket i also got a separate tamper for it i am looking to upgrade the grinder soon it seems to be the best really cheap espresso machine i would like to eventually to upgrade to something like a gaggia classic but i am happy on this machine now for learning to to make espresso and espresso based drink plus the grinder is my current limiting factor now anyway thanks for the review would love to see you review the sage bambino a that is what i am looking at purchasing yeah give it to charity so that kid can learn something lol awesome channel james i use a delonghi dedica ec 685 with the cheapest possible hand grinder everyday and thanks to you i manage to make a better and better coffee with it every day i do not have your tasting skill obviously but i must say that after a few month of fine tuning i get quite a pleasing coffee out of my setup if you ever plan on doing a review on the dedica it come with a pressurized porta filer but the basket can be easily changed to a non pressurized one keep up the awesome work cheer my mocha pot cost le than gbp10 and make perfectly decent espresso i think he is commented earlier that while he like the coffee you get out of a moka pot it is not technically an espresso since the pressure is much lower yes please the search for an affordable good espresso machine would be most welcome what about some cheap coffee bean review it would be funny to watch james can you recommend coffee machine that would give u a decent cup of espresso without breaking the bank i would say gbp350 is my budget thanks to you i do not need to get any of these electronic garbage i find when you complaint you resemble james may in a good way please show how well these machine can froth milk when the scale is more expensive than the espresso machine marc antunes i am certainly no expert on grinder but the grinder james is using in this video is the niche zero it is a single dose conical burr grinder you can see his video on that here i believe some people prefer flat burr to conical burr for espresso if so something like the eureka atom or cheaper mignon could be a good starting point all the way through to the ceado e37s and beyond feralferret i am looking for a grinder what is the james is model any tip to choose a good one feralferret to be fair that wa the premise of the video when all 5 espresso machine combined gbp315 are still only worth 63percent of price of the grinder gbp500 thank you james i found this very interesting i look forward seeing your review on the base minimum machine you would recommend a someone wanting to replace a de longhi dedica and get more serious with espresso a a hobby i can not wait to see what you think is the bare minimum guess i will have to pick up v60 brewing in the meantime from my perspective i predict the cheapest adequate machine is going to be the rancilio silvia i would be super keen to see your review of it great video man looking forward to the follow up re minimum a video with some espresso machine stepping up to 200 or 300 buck would be amazing i think it is only right and proper that marc rebillet responds to this act of solidarity with song dedicated to james hoffmann and coffee how do we make this happen channel flavour a guide on how to find a good beginner espresso machine would be nice a good and solid machine not too expensive just to get you started great video james i would be interested in you segmenting the market i to cheap medium high very high and unlimited budget and then pointing out the best for the buck option in each category buy a used gaggia classic for gbp100 best starter machine around to learn the basic on 9 40 yes yes yes i am sure any regular to this channel will love this i have a beko espresso machine with pressurized portafilter that i bought last year for 90 euro on discount the machine have a good build quality but because it a pressurized portafilter i have struggled and i have never pulled a good espresso shot from it i thought maybe it the coffee so i kept changing it that is why i started to watch your video so i can understand anything related to coffee and maybe one day i could get one decent shot from my machine now that i have watched this video i know it a lost cause and i am waiting for your video of the bare minimum to have a good espresso at home so if gbp100 is too little how much more would you have to pay to buy a machine that make a decent espresso at home whenever i have a bad day i watch his video and just listen to his calm soothing voice talking about coffee his voice seriously how about the steamer i am a latte drinker and i found a lot of cheap espresso machine ha some big problem for steamer head hi first the grovel a an enthusiastic consumer of espresso for more time than i care to mention i love your video i am almost hesitant to ask but what are your thought on the nespresso pod system for espresso i know the coffee is the variable in this but what about the espresso delivery system itself i am looking to de faff my kitchen and just need espresso without the hobby part i live in shanghai now and do not want to buy to many expensive stuff for my rental apartment but i like good coffee so i bought used delonghi c146 in mint condition for about 30dollar the seller included decent hand grinder and super nice metal tamper so i never use that plastic garbage mounted to the weird spot i ended up buying electric grinder anyway cuz hand grinding in the morning is super annoying and with this setup i would say i am getting pretty decent shot for extremely cheap price thanks for your video do you vary the force with which you use the tamper good review this is something that always bug me there is very little good review information about comparison budget better segment machine i have a delonghi cafe treviso machine which seems to be exactly the same a your delonghi but cheaper and styled a bit differently i am quite happy with the espresso i am able to get out of it although it indeed is fidgety i bought a nice fitting tamper for better feel a indeed the bottom tamper is annoying you can pull it out and do manually though my reference for good espresso is limited i do have some in coffee shop once in a while but i do like good coffee at home a i like the ambiance here better but with good starting coffee on both side i feel i can beat most bean to cup system can not wait for the future video would be interesting if this wa done with the supermarket coffee they are kind of designed for i do not think someone that is only going to spend gbp100 of an esspresso machine will pay alot for a grinder if supermarket coffee suck so much an interesting concept would be what can you do for gbp100 grinder machine or alternative i have a delonghi espresso machine where i live in canada sadly it doe have a pressurized portafilter so the espresso is most of the time disapointing lacking something anyway it is around 150 cad without quebec is tax so i guess it doe fall in the sub 100 pound espresso machine range i think i should have stayed at my parent house in france who own an automatic delonghi coffee machine that brew some better espresso is even though you can not intervein in the process joke aside i am eager to start working full time and not a a student so i can get myself a better machine love the video a always james i have a gaggia classic which ha made me good coffee every day for 15 year i wonder if any of those would do the same it make good espresso and it look nice i would argue it will be cheaper in the long run than any of these same with the gagga correct me if i am wrong but his grinder look like a blade grinder hi james hope to share the americano machine one day i have this one from amazon brewsly 15 bar espresso machine stainless steel compact espresso maker with milk frother wand professional coffee machine for espresso cappuccino and latte i do wish i knew more about pressurized basket before i purchased it it wa around dollar164 i have found that pressurized always leaf me with a soupy puck and brewing with the 2 cup basket seems fine but if i brew a single cup basket it smell more bitter and i am not sure how to fix that i do have a good grinder though i think the breville bcg820bssxl the smart grinder pro since i go between pour over and espresso right now i bought a sunbeam minibarista machine for low dollar200aus based upon a recommendation from the australian consumer comparison organisation choice and it make better coffee than many of the coffee made by cafe i have had a delonghi forever i want to say ten year now always thought my espresso were the best ever this wa way before i knew there wa this guy named james hoffmann who taught this average joe about what espresso really is i have basically have been waiting for mine to die well that day wa 3 day ago and now it seems too soon i am not looking for top of the line because i can not afford it but something better than the delonghi since now after watching your video any thing i get is going to be way better than what i had the problem is 1 money 2 my wife i want to save a bit and do more research before jumping and buying what i am thinking is going to be the best for my buck and that is the gaggia classic pro the problem is my wife say i think too much and need to buy something now what do i doooooo any way thanks for your video keep me well informed wife is always going to be a problem when you are trying to purchase want and not need lol can try aca espressso machine from china cost 80usd i had a very cheap electrolux eea111 for quite some time student could not afford anything else very inconsistent brewing but i used it daily for more than a year i plan on buying something of higher quality for my next espresso machine and i can not wait for your upcoming video about what would be the best valued budget machine my friend gave me 1 of those cheap espresso machine and it make okay coffee should i invest in another good moka pot will it improve over the cheap one amazon basic morphy richards i have owned a cheap machine it wa given to me year ago it wa a mr coffee or something like that it wa actually very alright for two day then i broke it or it busted itself and i tossed it away i have a delonghi ec 685 with a sligthly modified pressurized portafilter drilled a bigger hole in it since you can remove the filter itself the weird thing is it pull ok ish shot from a lavazza bean but i am unable to get a decent result from good more expensive espresso bean hi no we do not own any of these type of coffee machine we use or have used tassimo for the last 4 year and we love this type of coffee machine think you would be better off with an aero press than buy one of these platic machine the problem i had wa a james said consistency i started my home brewing experience with a similar style cheepish machine it lasted some time and then got upgraded to a sage barista express and i realised how bad the coffee from the cheaper machine wa i felt like i had done a disservice to the local coffee roaster i had been getting my coffee from i would totally agree with you we had the delonghi for about 4 week before boxing it back up and we then spent a bit more money to get a far superior machine currently back watching your video loving the wealth of knowledge and the love of coffee i like the video idea for an espresso machine that would be worth getting for just starting out but not spending too much the new gaggia classic ha to be a consideration redesigned steam wand and the solenoid valve ha returned i actually bought the cheapest espresso machine on amazon 30euros i wa just getting into making espresso and thought how bad could it be gt extremely bad waste of time i made one coffee then sent it back instantly it spent le than 12 hour inside my home sadly due to covid a lot of cafe are getting rid of their gear i got a commercial grinder for gbp120 i would go for the used market any day would love the bear minimum good espresso video anything under dollar500 or so better off buying a refurb baratza maestro and a press pot make way better coffee i think your conclusion on the delonghi is a little harsh yeah it feel cheap yeah it is probably not going to last super long it is the furthest thing from premium but it is also darn decent espresso at a fraction of the price of the next step up not the best not the most consistent and not without a learning curve to get the best out of it but if you want espresso and are on a tight budget i think you can be happy with it i have been for six month now using it every morning a someone new to home espresso it ha taught me a ton about making them that i will carry on to my better machine someday i think it make a great entry level machine that is not intimidating to learn on if you do not know what you are doing so yeah i agree with most of what you said you have to keep your expectation in check a the thing try to vibrate it way off of the counter every morning but i do not agree with your conclusion because i think some people in the right circumstance namely those without much money or new to espresso of which i am both can be happy with that machine for the price of 20 of the cup of swill i used to get through drive throughs i can make something infinitely better at home that is awesome having said that i am super glad my previous research led me toward the delonghi rather than any of those others yikes deja brew that get a thumb up right there hello james to test these machine must have been a frustrating experience after having tested the cremina how would they work with a course ground coffee instead of the fine ground i would not mind a video with grade of coffee grind just got a breville barista express took some fine tuning but i have been getting some good shot out of it 16g in around 32 35g out in 29 second it is pricey but i felt like it is still cheaper then buying a decent machine a decent grinder i finally got to a point where i wanted to try and start making my own coffee a opposed to starbucks or 7 eleven in between pay period with that said i do not think i know what a truly great espresso can be but i started on my journey i purchased an espresso machine the mr coffee cafe barista and then came across your video unfortunately lol i hope eventually this machine make one of you comparison review video so i can learn a thing or two that may help me anyway keep up the awesome work james hey bud i bought this machine a month ago he would almost 100percent say it is okay coffee because he is just used to professionally brewed coffee everyday but we can enjoy our latte and cappuccino i love this little machine so far and it is a great entry machine happy new year great video thank you james i had a chinese machine very similar to amazon the tase wa awful i had no exp with the expensive machine but i do have coffee in bar so i could compare mine looking forward to the minimum standard video the swan us the same portafilter a mr coffee one even the delonghi make an average espresso is just good enough to avoid spitting nice video btw another great video i have a delonghi dedica which i find give ok result but not a great coffee making experience i have used a presso upgraded to rok spec for quite a few year and have managed to get a fairly decent espresso from it i also have a gbp25 sainsbury is coffee maker which dispenses awful espresso but because my wife like a latt and i occasionally drink cappuccino i use for steaming milk with practice it doe a half decent job latt art is taking a bit longer to get right though what about the nespresso machine the essenza mini about dollar150 this is all well and good but i would like to see is what is the cheapest machine and grinder that will consistently produce decent espresso i have exactly that delonghi doubled with a decent grinder i can manage to pull quite consistent shot overall i would say it is not bad among the cheap machine of course you are right my next machine i would aim at much higher level at least with a non pressurized basket and a decent tamper looking forward for more review on coffee machine that would give at least the bare minimum performance i totally agree with what james said at the end i bought a delonghi ecp 33 21 on impulse a the price wa slightly affordable to kickstart my coffee making journey esp with the minimal knowledge i have on coffee over time a i learned more about coffee making and the factor that contributes to a good coffee i realised i became continually dissatisfied with the outcome of the coffee produced on this machine i thought it wa me and not the machine but from jame is vid here i now realised that it better to research more and save for a better machine instead of impulsively buying one that seems affordable hope this experience help those out there thinking of purchasing a coffee machine too fan of marc rebillet and midlake dude stop making me love you so much what about like gbp200 any suggestion from y all you should make a part 2 video on how they steam milk i have an oster priva latte never knew it had a pressurized basket i have struggled to pull shot that are really good i have got ok one thanks for pointing this out with a proper porta filter i may have hope for a good espresso yet thank you for addressing the pressurised pf found in so many home espresso machine i happen to own a saeco aroma unit that i like quite well however i am always struggling to get the right grind size right tamping pressure 35 second brew time sweet spot i found the following information on a saeco part and repair site all saeco pressurized portafilters have built in valve for pre infusion delay the operator doe not have to worry much about the fineness of grind or tamping the grind setting should be like the table salt grain no tamping is necessary the valve inside the portafilter prevents flow of water through for 4 to 5 second allowing the extraction pressure to build to the required 9 bar the 4 to 5 second delay allows the coffee ground to be soaked and swell allowing water to dissolve essential aromatic element in the coffee before extraction a the valve open up at 9 bar pressure the coffee extract drip into the cup a a classic shot of espresso if the quantity of extract is limited to 2 oz it will not be bitter or have any burnt taste because the extraction time is never more than 12 second it seems 12 second and no tamping is the sweet spot here interested in hearing your thought nicko persilion ordering one now from seattle coffee gear dollar40 not bad now i need to find me a good tamper gutti nvm just google saeco bottomless portafilter 53mm you will find what you want just get one of those nicko persilion alright thanks for all that info i will get into the modified home made bottomless then hopefully i do not screw it up and ruin it for good gutti i do not think there is just gut out the whole original portafilter and make it a bottomless a ppf is nasty and unhygienic running it empty we see the water is always somewhat dirty and rancid from the accumulated gunk just unscrew the 3 screw holding the metal assembly to the plastic base throw away all rubber and other plastic part that is in there clamp the upper metallic part of the portafilter into a vise get a dremel and just hollow it out or use hand tool drill several contiguous hole just enough to start cutting with a mini hacksaw clean the rough cut with a half round file then finish by sawing off the black plastic spout just short of the screw hole nicko persilion thank you you pretty much summed up my experience with it adjusting the variable give me extremely inconsistent result specially when changing the roast level of coffee bean i feel like i have no control whatsoever i will try your suggestion of grinding coarser and no tamping probably need to find me a non pressurize portafilter to replace the ppf that came with it any suggestion where to get one that will fit this one ha a 54mm basket btw i found a hack to get the coffee flowing again when stalled i just gently open and close the steam knob 5 31 the rok maybe i have the cusinart em100 it is a little nicer than these but still get let down my the pressurised basket yes thank you james now i better understand why my entry level machine is so frustrating and seldom used at what point would they get better than a moka pot wow mine so identical to the first one yes the issue the temp is hardly stable the flow shot is a bit too fast but a for me still really fine enough for my daily cup of latte for home espresso machine under 100 pound i do not like espresso but i watched the whole vid i like coffee but i am fine with espresso a something i have in a cafe or bar and making my own coffee some more homey way e g by moka pot or aeropress okuusava how annoying for you what set up do you use at home you have got the italian way to me this is the optimal but i do not have coffee shop near by and the one we have they make worse coffee than i someone know the cup brand i love this idea a someone who wa gifted a cheap espresso machine mr coffee i am glad to hear there is the potential that it more the machine than me i will be very interested to see what you believe is the bare minimum to spend on good espresso thank you for all you do james yes to a video about bare minimum good coffee machine mine is a cheap one i kinda hacked it to get a decent espresso i would be interested in seeing a review of a super automatic say the x small seaco it is one of the cheapest super automatic available at around 300 dollar i do not even drink coffee what am i doing here i love coffee and make it at home but do not plan on buying an espresso machine or grinder and i have been watching lot of video about espresso machine and grinder if you like these video dive into the fountain pen world same vibe there not sure if there is a corresponding james hoffman in the fountain pen aficionado mondo i rarely drink coffee and find james rather pretentious yet i am absolutely captivated by his video james is personality and his video tends to lure people in that might not have an interest in coffee it is nice to see people stumbling onto his video they are very good learning about others like and hobby good on ya i am anxiously looking forward to your ultimate minimum expense espresso setup that make good coffee i am surprised that the mr coffee ecmp50 is not in that line up i have purchased those for year and find it produce wonderful espresso one weakness is that even with regular descaling the seam in the part of the machine that heat the water routinely wear out causing leak not knowing how to replace the water heating mechanism i have no choice but to buy another ecmp50 if you design and distribute a good espresso machine for about dollar100 pound perhaps you could also design and distribute a good manual coffee grinder with a good range of grind for about the same price that would be a killer combination and i would love to give it a whirl kept going back to that deja brew part coz it is not everyday you will see james face look that genuinely bright and happy i gave up on an actual espresso machine because of the cost for a decent one based on another video by james i reverted to a moka pot for milk based drink what i would like to see james review is the bialetti brikka which is a moka pot with a weight attachment that creates creama doe the brikka work better than the cheap espresso machine best cheap option i have found is the aeropress one of them with a splash of milk is my goto especially travelling and hiking and that is great to get a great cup of coffee but you can not do espresso with an aeropress not even close not nearly enough pressure i had a delonghi for a while and it wa ok got the job done i have a rebranded version of the swan retro i only have milk drink so it doe the job but i am looking to invest in something a little better looking forward to seeing what you find that doe a decent job at a good price so no no ok thanks de ja brew lol stop it james it better to spend more for a quality my mom would aways say you could have got it cheaper then you are replacing it more now a day you need to spend for quality to last longer it not like the old day where thing where made to last the delonghi dedica style is really ok my opinion maybe you will check it out i want to see this guy rating coffee double blinded same coffee same machine but present it a 20 different shot looking forward to the next video you mentioned i know it doe not make espresso but it seems like a better buy for this budget would be a moka pot no i had a delonghi for awhile because i could not afford the gaggia classic that i really wanted i felt that it pulled okay shot but not great it steamed milk very well however i eventually got the gaggia and a really good grinder and am very happy with the result i get from it after a few week of experimenting so when you ended this video with the delonghi a the one that gave the best result i totally understood from my own experience i felt that the shot were not bitter but maybe on the weak side it also only came with the pressurized basket it produced pretty good crema if you can not afford a cafe entry level or better machine i would agree that the delonghi is an inexpensive alternative but you will not get the same quality espresso that you get at a good coffee shop or a more expensive machine decent grinder bare minimum is la pavoni europiccola or rancilio silvia get them used for a cheap espresso machine these machine are good for determining whether you really want to make your own espresso or not if the mess and frustration doe not send you running then it is worth investing in a better machine ideally one someone with a bigger pocketbook bought tried once or twice and decided wa not for them and if it doe at least you did not spend dollardollardollar to find that out i have a hunch that the flair espresso machine will be the winner of the budget espresso machine i am so glad i did not buy a cheap espresso machine i really wanted to recently but i am glad i went with a bialetti brikka make it own brand of turbocharged moka very nicely and in a milk based drink i can forget it is not espresso sometimes heaven can wait marc rebillet i have the first one in australia is distribuito by kmart from anko brand but is the same by the look of it and i paid 70aud for it for the price it doe a fair job once you know your way around it and can steam the milk decently a well a bit of tweaking and knowing your machine is needed but it fill my caffeine need i have a mr coffee espresso machine it is cheap that is it only good point i would like very much to have a quality machine but i think what is being retailed right now is overpriced i wish someone retailed used restaurant quality machine gaggia baby i went from a seaco via venezia which did the job for 10 year in the later stage upgraded to a naked porta filter in the end after 4 to 5 coffee every day it just grew tired and lacked the power to produce multiple drink quickly when more than one wa required after much thought research and lusting ending up taking the plunge and investing in a high end rocket espresso machine precisely to the point of quality build of machine and longevity when maintained a well a the coffee experience both for myself making multiple coffee every day but also people visiting and receiving coffee from it quality is always worth the wait extra work and hard work well would you look at that cup is empty time for another soooo short answer is no got it i bought espresso machine for 50 quid using for 3 year until i bought delonghi dedica deluxe and realized i wa drinking crappie espresso every day lol i want a machine but i will wait until you put out the other video on what a decent machine would cost fantastic video mate great and honest review james so should you rather go with an aero press instead of a cheap maschine if you want to make cappuccino for instance i had the older version of the delonghi i used it for three year before the boiler have out the older version had a pressurized portafilter and the espresso shot were decent enough for a day to day q if i wanted something resembling espresso and only had 100 pound what would i buy a 4 moka pot any video reference where we can compare those jet stream v a normal stream from a group head thanks for the video lot of bad hardware there sacrifice them to the recycling yard maybe the sage breville bambino or de longhi dedica might be next cheapest workable option though not sure if dedica ha non pressurised basket what is the cheapest way to make good espresso i have the delonghi dedica and it is pretty good but it is in the dollar250 range i do get a plastic smell in the water tank but i wash it out before i use it and it is ok i need to save to get a better one for sure also the quote about the tamper and the pixar movie killed me so funny i would like to see a battle rancilio silvia v6 v new gaggia classic p s i love this video too ha marc reb any relation to jim 7 4 of the machine are pressurized portafilters ayt how fine or coarse did u grind your coffee really enjoy watching your video it is almost therapeutic for me some people who are ok with capsule quality do use these a cheaper le wasteful alternative some 25 year ago i had a couple of cheap espresso machine they were okay but i get better coffee out of a moka pot tbh though it is not espresso one of my friend year back sold me to save up about 600 buck and get a breville dunno if that is true very much interested in this journey i am a college student and for christmas one year my dad got me a coffee machine that look identical to the amazon basic one without the amazon label on it for making coffee i far prefer my french press because it make really bad espresso the and only in my opinion good thing that it ha going for it is that the milk steamer is really easy to use and i think it work better than using a french press to fluff hot milk so though i only use this feature once in a blue moon that is the only reason i keep it around i have a nespresso essenza mini that i am using with the re cap system i think with a bit of practice it make a decent espresso but am probably horribly wrong either way i would love a review from james on this janky set up how would these stand up to a dense brew dialed in on an aeropress i am one of those that is really excited to hear your opinion on what you view a the cheapest decent machine you can get i have been looking for a while and have never really purchased anything because i do not want to spend a lot my kitchen doe not allow me to have the space for a sage breville machine with the grinder attached but i have seriously considered it many time anyway i have recently looked at the delongi dedica but it doe have the pressurized basket unfortunately anyway really looking forward to the video a they come out so if you already have the delonghi have had it for 15 year how do you work within the confines of that machine to get the best cup possible hi james ha anyone made a metal disk with hole or a mesh that just sits on top of the coffee in the portafilter to protect the puck from a bad or non existent shower screen is this a good idea have a good one very excited to see this video in my subscription the swan retro is also sold in australia a the kmart anko cm5013 and got a great deal of positive medium attention recently very much agreed with your comment i would just add that the steam wand is a bit crap too i love the idea of doing the research and testing on what the bear min investment to get good espresso i am in that boat of wanting the hobby drinking but not such a heavy financial investment the only thing i have gathered from watching james hoffman is that i like gross coffee i want it bitter and sour can not argue with taste i guess 1 rule with coffee in my opinion if you like it you are making it right ok now do cheap espresso machine that do not use pressurised portafilters since that clearly influenced the outcome here could you review the breville barista express and so begin the quest to find the cheapest espresso machine that make good coffee and is not a pain in the as to use thank you deja brew could you paper filter the krup to stop the tunneling effect i am a barista and so i wa gifted a machine by my lovely mother from lidl or aldi not sure which to be honest that look identical in nearly every way to the swan machine in this video and i agree with everything you said it is absolutely geared towards a foamy crema but after a lot of tweak and a now extremely specific routine i have actually managed to get some fairly decent espresso from it but at a huge cost to the pleasurable experience of making a morning espresso to me a machine like this although apparently an accessible to all option really actually is only going to make decent coffee if used by one of u who know the trick of the trade and at that point why would we put ourselves through the pain of using one of these other that pure budget issue like for me a a broke student currently saving up for an investment machine at a higher price and completely agree with you that that is the best option overall looking forward to the video on some of the higher end but still affordable machine on the market may i ask what your extremely specific routine is i would like to see a video like this about budget grinder and i would also like to see a video where you experiment to find a very good combination entry point my eye are bigger than my budget and what i really want is a sette 270wi grinder and gaggia classic pro i think what is more realistic for me is a good low budget entry level grinder with flexibility in grind size and a moka pot an example of a grinder i would love to see you review is the capresso 560 1 which i think go for dollar75 usd i have been using a mr coffee espresso machine for the better part of 10 year every morning on my 4th machine i have been watching these show about espresso and thought i would not mind going for a better brand buy some the expense ha made me cringe got a secondhand rok for gbp30 on marketplace and i have had a lot of fun experimenting to get the best result from it certainly far better than anything with cheap construction part i agree waiting for the next review for the better choice thank you i do not know i feel like the delonghi machine is a double deal by shaking not only you wake up everyone in your house but you also give them a good espresso so they would be concerned already awake but also sipping their dollar99 99 alarm espresso machine can you donate the machine to me thanks x my first espresso machine wa a delonghi it served me meh espresso ish drink for almost 2 year fortunately i only paid 15 dollar for it at a garage sale it wa new in the box never used however since i have switched to the cafelat robot my coffee life ha changed for the better i can have good espresso at home and enjoy making coffee the delonghi wa noisy and kind of a pain especially when it started leaking all over the place i love the content i love the information given i love the delivery of the entire video but all i hear is the voice of winnie the poo i bought a unit similar to the andrew james the experience of making coffee with it wa not very enjoyable and i ended up giving it away the milk frother let me down now i get better result with a french press and a moka pot it will be very interesting to know what the bare minimum equipment set would be including grinder scale water filter etc the next challenge would be what is the next cheapest equipment set that make the biggest leap in quality kind of reminds me of old school audiophile equipment review sooo flair or a rok i have a mr coffee cafe barista machine that i got before i knew what to look for it ha the exact same portafilter basket setup a the swan including the spoon tamper thing i use it to make passable milk drink but i am saving up for something better i am very much looking forward to your review of the bare minimum machine maybe something like the gaggia classic pro hello what do you think about using naked portafilter with machine like breville i have been seeing it around lately and i am wondering what could be the logic behind it thank you so what model delonghi model wa it and i will be anxiously waiting for the next video on the minimum required for a good espresso thank you james you definitely have to review the gaggia classic 2015 model i have been using it for a while but even after installing the steam wand mod i still struggle to froth the milk to practice latte art before the opening wa in full swing i thought this is not going to end well and it did not i will watch amp sickly enjoy watching james gag on anything nasty fun a wonderful video that wa awesome james have been looking at get something at that price looking forward to seeing what the cheepest machine you think make really good espresso have you previously done a vid on the pod machine revolution i can not find one if you did i have got a lavazza pod machine and think it is great but i really do not know how to compare it with a proper espresso machine for me i would think gbp100 on a decent pod machine would be better than any of the machine you tested and that is exactly why i went that route but that could be a very wrong assumption anyway excellent vid a always krups more like kraps amirite haha you did not touch on it but all of the machine have pannarello steam wand which are designed for lot of milk foam with little effort from both the user and the machine the problem though is it is impossible to get a good texture from them so for people thinking about getting them for milk drink please reconsider they are not horrible but they are going to be very disappointing to use they are to steamed milk what pressurised portafilters are to espresso in my opinion i received a dollar35 espresso maker a a gift it is loud and dangerous and reminds me of the cornballer from arrested development because of how hot it get it produce coffee basically exactly a you have described impossible to get a balanced cup it eventually went behind the blender never to be used again i think there is real reason to try to talk people out of getting these cheaper one because i pretty much gave up on espresso after that i am not really sure what i can trust to do what it is supposed to do unless i buy at least dollar600 of chrome great vid james i have had my delonghi ec146 for around 5 year now and when i found your video at the beginning of this year it changed how i used the machine entirely before i wa store bought pre ground coffee and knew nothing about espresso now i follow your vids closely am part of the r espresso community and freshly grind every morning replaced that nasty built in tamper too thank you coffee jesus i wa waiting for this please expand the series a i would rather spend a little more and get something better subject to your blessing stewie is that you thanks for educating me that is what i have been thinking about for a really long time how a prosumer is near best grinder and a so called normal espresso machine work together thank you james we are pretty broke and my boyfriend got me the cookworks machine for christmas gbp54 i love the coffee i can make from it and i used to have a prufrock coffee everyday when i worked at the pub down the road it may not be the perfect espresso but it hit the spot well enough for the price very interesting to see what is the minimum spend for good espresso maybe the sunbeam mini barista not very much more than these one but from a brand that ha some idea think i will stick with my aeropress what worked for me wa an initial investment of gbp150 gbp100 on a 2011 gaggia classic from ebay and gbp50 on cafiza descaler blind filter a couple of grouphead gasket seal and the bit i needed to be able to set the pressure to 7 bar 1 month later i got a pid kit from mr shade for gbp99 and installed it paired with a feld 47 i have got a setup that is consistent predictable and capable of excellent result for gbp400 that is eerie a day or two before this video came out i bought myself an espresso machine for gbp50 oh yeah i bought one for gbp49 99 love your stuff james i think it would be really cool if you also did more roasting information and even with some footage in your roastery hope to visit some day a well my first machine wa one of those swan retro i hated it it forced me to buy a sage that is what they are good for education sweet t shirt can we get a dollar300 dollar500 range review where spending that extra money is potentially worthwhile try delonghi ec 685 with a good tamper it great and cheap machine this wa a great video i have now invested into a grinder and wa looking into a smaller machine i bought these so you do not have too that should be the title of the video wa there a saturation change on 8 56 8 58 i look forward to your future espresso machine review i ordered a niche zero grinder but will not receive it until august here in the u i am planning on buying an espresso machine once i have a great grinder on hand i about bought the delonghi after a long drawn out systematic approach i went with the breville infuser so far so good i think the ultimate deciding factor for any coffee device is whether or not it help to create coffee good enough to be worth it required setup and cleanup a good grinder sure usually just a dusting off and banging out the ground container and occasionally wiping it down really well in exchange for a huge jump in coffee quality a pourover filter basket or an aeropress excellent coffee just a rinse under hot water and occasionally hitting it with a soapy brush to clean off residue an espresso machine is going to require more work and a little more cleanup after every use so it is not worth having unless it make consistently good espresso if it make consistently excellent espresso all the better dope shirt your colour grading randomly stop at 8 56 but thanks for the great review i owned a delonghi machine ec270 i think that i got for not much more than dollar100 i enjoyed the coffee that it produced then again i am almost certain that my standard for what constitutes good coffee are well below james is for instance it had a pressurized portafilter i did have a fairly decent burr grinder and a proper tamper though well i wa tempted with a cheap ish espresso machine around 250euros then i got deaper into coffee by binging your video and wanted a gaggia classic a eureka mignon specialita i ended up with the grinder and a rocket appartamento nahh just v60 could you test a sage breville duo tempo amp an iberital mc2 grinder james is wearing a marc ribellet t shirt so cool another awesome youtuber who is probably the exact opposite personality to james but i appreciate both james and marc deeply i have a delonghi scultura which is a step or 2 above the one in this vid but apparently share some of it flaw although also is a little more refined i have been praying for the bare minimum video and am looking forward to it wonderful content a always thank you james i can spend more than dollar100 but can not afford a dollar2 000 machine so i will look forward to your promised video of some machine priced between these to extreme really love the channel thanks i have an oster which is basically the same model a the amazonbasics from this video i have had no problem with it talking about how it made and the possible mechanical flaw obviously i am just an amateur in this barista world yet i like what i can do with it specially since it did not hit my budget thanks for the video wa waiting for this for so long can you compare the best of this group to the next tier up something like a sage breville i have a delonghi very similar to the one you had but in america and you are absolutely right frustrating not inspiring doe the job i guess not great but good enough just barely definitely a good starter to see if you care but the first one i had died four month in so i have been using a free replacement i would not have paid for another please test gaggia classic i love my ecm dual boiler but if i wa starting out now on a budget i would be looking at the expobar lev or la pavoni giotto both great value and gest coffee is it possible to use a non pressurized porta filter with these machine is that even an option i have the breville cafe rom and am experiencing the same issue honestly i think the breville express is going to be the absolute bare minimum if you want anything resembling a hobby with coffee lxxiii love my sage breville barista express i hold on to my ec155 while my friend upgraded to bbe some even upgraded to 920 dual boiler i am thinking of boarding the rocket ship chris jones i would agree with you i researched all the brand carefully for several month and decided on the breville barista express it usually sell for dollar700 but got a deal for one for dollar500 in the stainless steel version and i am obsessed with it make excellent espresso and my morning are so much happier it would be great to watch you make good espresso in the all time favourite silvia and gaggia classic i allways tought this kind of machine would make horrible coffee still waiting for a good one i can not wait for your next video about the minimum requirement good review thanks james for the helpful video i buy cheap stuff just to try and make them work better that is not for everyone i know i tinker and love to solve problem mr coffee espresso maker is cheaper than all your machine single boiler non pressurized filter and i use a encore grinder james if you want to go into the low budget area i would suggest you look at nespresso combined with waycap the waycap allows you to use your own coffee in the simple nespresso machine i find it a hassle to clean but you could do worse in the low budget market for under 100 00 i bought the nespresso pixie about 3 year ago so far the easiest and best tasting coffee however coffee doe come in capsule which is even easier would you do another kind of this episode but going up in budget looking forward to a minimum viable product espresso machine video that cream colored machine is really pretty hi james i have that yellow espresso machine but the model is different and patented by myria myria my4052 owns this model and i am not happy with it at all but i will change it anyway a for coffee the coffee is slightly bitter and sour after many setting james please compare espresso is from a classic espresso machine and a super automatic bean to cup machine great advice these junk end product are just a total waste of really the earth is resource just save a bit more dosh and use a little stove top in the meantime enjoyed that video please do not put your good little grinder so close to the edge of the table apart from that love the video mr hoffmann glad that i skipped the very lower end of the spectrum when it come to espresso machine a you frequently mention the hobby part of making your own espresso what are your thought on self maintenance of your hardware do you replace part yourself for instance thanks again and likewise i honestly feel like the flair a good grinder is the cheapest and most bang for your buck way of making incredible espresso i have made shot a good a my higher tier cafe it take skill and investing time in the technique and maybe a bit of faff with preheating but it is so worth it would you please do the same you mentioned at the end for grinder a well a coffee machine would be a great help best bet is go used i got a new sage barista touch for just over gbp400 a year ago because it had a tiny scratch on the side that face my wall i also found a sage barista express for under gbp280 refurbed for a friend definitely bargain to be had if someone told me they had to have espresso and it had to be under a gbp100 i hate to say it but i would be sending them to nespresso for a machine for a gbp1 and a contract for pod d the condescending twat is at it again coffee 101 good coffee is what you enjoy no matter the price of the machine the type of bean the type of grind it is what you enjoy taking 20 minute and spending gbpgbpgbpgbp doe not guarantee good coffee if you spend your time faffing around like this guy doe not only do you have to much time on your hand you really are the epitome of first world smugness those pressurized portafilters with the rubber gasket inside are meant to be used for ese pod i have never used them myself but that is the purpose of those mrcoffee for year it ha been my go to espresso and frother machine for u 45dollar you get a better cup than that of starbucks once you figure out just how you like it come out perfect every time this is such a good unit i have one in my van hi james thank you for the video looking forward to your opinion on what you consider to be the bare minimum machine to enjoy the experience of making espresso at home perfect video looking forward for minimum machine needed to prepare an ok espresso another interesting video would be good to see a sister video looking at how little one could spend on a grinder and machine combo that still give decent ok espresso buy cheap espresso machine and wonder why they are crap a couple of year ago i picked up a very cheap machine on sale in lidl from the design i suspect it wa a made in the same factory a the swan albeit in black and with a slightly different button placement personally i found the best result from pre ground coffee possibly because my equally cheap burr grinder possibly because that is what it is designed for i would not say the result come anywhere near a decent coffee shop but it compare favorably with what i used to get out of a moka pot or a capsule machine i think nice but a bit dull is a fair description of most of what i pull from it and to be honest at breakfast that is fine for the rest of the day i make a large pot using a chonky boi french press from ikea thanks for the recommendation jesus you are far too dramatic this tamper is deeply unpleasant to use dude it is a piece of plastic meant to compress coffee get over yourself thank you very much for your honesty james that is the reason why i we follow you you missed the mr coffee caf steam it make a good cup of espresso though not very flexible hi what about under gbp200 aloha from hawaii great review pretty much what i expected my question wa what would the a really good machine for the best price but you addressed that and will be making that video soon i hope also what wa the grinder you were using thank you awesome please do a review of cheap automatic espresso machine this is a great project james look forward to the future of your work the de longhi is ec152 very similar to the machine in the video wa my first home espresso machine back when i wa still a broke student and with that and a decent hand grinder i made pretty good coffee in the most labour intensive way imaginable for about two year i pushed it to the very limit of what it is capable of and during my time with it it taught me an awful lot i opened it up serviced tweaked tinkered and made perhaps a half dozen diy upgrade to it before i finally retired it and actually right now with my full size machine tragically out of service needing expensive part i just can not find during lockdown i am considering dusting off the de longhi again i agree we need an explanation or even a video of your improvement what kind of mod did you do to the de longhi more interested in the best least expensive bean grinder for espresso best shirt ever i got a sage duo temp pro for gbp200 great machine that make great espresso give it a look so i am 90percent certain that amazon basic is a knock off of an older mr coffee brand espresso machine which i own i am sure it make crap quality espresso but i got it from a second hand store 6 year ago for 10 buck and ha served me well enough what i find to be really funny is it almost look like mr coffee retired that model and then someone just bought all the part mold and kept on making them lol to add to my previous comment make a tiered list of the bare minimum you need then suggest the next step up the next step up not such a small upgrade where you get coffee that is 5percent better for dollar200 more i will just drop a little comment i had owned an espresso machine that wa sold in aldi ireland a good few year back and wa actually made on delonghi part when i opened it up after it broke it had most of delonghi inside i bought an unpressurised basket for it and managed with a bit to care to pull good shot for that machine is standard no channelling when it gave up the ghost i could not repair it myself and i found this one from andrew james which wa identical to the aldi one with one extra tweak very handy the on off button timer the machine would power off after 5 minute of not being used it wa a good machine for the price and i have enjoyed it it broke within the guarantee and andrew james replaced with a newer model the one you have reviewed which upon initial try i returned to the company with a note that it truly is a de improvement and it is awful and i forfeit my right to the guaranteed repair replacement i bought another second hand on ebay that one broke a month ago and i wa given used gaggia cubika plus which damn you gaggia ha the most horrible portafilter i have ever seen with some finicky mechanism inside of it and it truly is a piece of garbage and there is no alternative portafilter to buy unless you know one and i did not manage to pull any decent shot since i am nearly giving up on trying to get a budget machine and thinking of getting a moccamaster instead any advice especially towards the cubika plus portafilter fiasco would be greatly appreciated much obliged always a pleasure watching your video if you made a video about the bare minimum like you said i would be all over it in an instant it is so hard for someone to get started making good coffee you get a mix of people saying spend a little a possible and you get your coffee snob that say you need to spend at least dollar5 000 to make decent coffee i love how much james hate everything in these cheap review i am going to keep watching in the vain hope that one day something surprise him will taylor yeah but instant coffee is a whole different animal lol game spirit a blind taste test would be a good idea james did one with instant coffee i believe it wa good fun he should do a blind taste test between the best of these machine and a dollar2000 machine you and i both know he will not though blind taste test make a lot of pretentious coffee folk look bad they can almost never tell the difference he learned to drive in a bugatti la voiture noire any other car he test is a piece of shit for him this is why i brought a bialetti brikka no point buying a cheap espresso machine when the brikka pot will do just a good a job if not better and with superior build quality brikka is far more regulated and consistent than traditional moka he basically doe not like coffee i envy too people who like bad coffee just realised you are the 2007 world champion barista epic i look forward to more video from you on what constitutes the bare minimum of spending for a great at home espresso experience i love the coffee hobby and i want to eventually invest in my own machine i respect your video and your opinion very much this is my favorite coffee channel on youtube looking forward to the next installment and finding out what is a reasonable budget ish espresso machine thanks potential video idea best drip coffee maker for under or around gbp100 in particular i have the wilfa classic in mind thanks i have had a few de longhi machine in the past when i thought spending more than gbp100 wa a waste especially a they tended to only last a year before the pump or the element stopped working i did have a burr grinder though last year i came to my sens and brought an hx model from rocket and a decent grinder did the amount i spent scare me you bet do i now get better tasting coffee and a pleasant experience every morning though oh yes indeedy it is funny how easy it is to think a few hundred that is a waste and then spend a few hundred on machine that keep breaking lol i have done the same thing loved the video i have a dollar220 delonghi espresso machine and it pretty good but it also ha a pressurized filter basket id love to find a non pressurized filter basket that could fit into my portafilter if anyone know where i can get one that fit the model is ecp3630 and just reply to this thanks thank you for listening james i have had the capresso ec pro and now have the brevelle duo temp pro both came with standard and pressurized basket and both made great espresso both under dollar300 u using a baratza encore grinder in my opinion spending le than dollar250 on a machine is not even worth it also had some luck with the nanopresso manual pump thingy but you can only make 1 shot until the pump overheats and wont let any water through my prediction minimum espresso machine needed to satisfy james hoffman gaggia classic minimum espresso machine needed to satisfy james hoffman is hair decent espresso i have got a de longhi a better model and i drink decent espresso every day i work a a barista with a keenvanderwestern spirit and obviously it is a totally different story but you can drink decent espresso with a limited budget a long a you buy god speciality coffee my immediate thought for the machine that had water spraying everywhere wa for you to put an aeropress filter on top of the puck to try to distribute the water more gently but i think not mentioning that you are using a 600dollar grinder could be an issue to someone who is got a 50dollar grinder and thinking they should go out and buy a 100dollar machine because 100dollar is not too bad for espresso all that being said i think that doing a cost comparison for home gear to drinking out for a year would be a real eye opener for a lot of people who hesitate to spend 100dollar on a baratza encore and 20dollar lb on coffee niche is more than 600 usd by the way hey james could you please review the la pavoni europiccola is it any good user guide tutorial looking forward to that next tier up video maybe with the ec150 from capresso jura i hope you will include some superautomatics in your survey i started with a gaggia espresso no 3 way valve bought used on ebay for around dollar100 upgrade pid bottomless pf better basket silvia steam wand paired with a la pavoni zip base grinder also used around dollar100 new burrset great espresso is possible on a tight budget if you know where to compromise ikawa sample roaster can you do a review of that please personally i think the best of the cheaper machine is the sage bambino plus you should test that in your next batch the de longhi wa my first espresso machine and i use a breville barista espresso machine now looking forward to your at home series a i am looking to up my game great video you hit all the key note i wa looking for fancy finding you here not only doe the machine get out away to never come out again but it also help put many people off the idea of dropping more money on a better espresso machine thus stop yet another person getting in to espresso and enjoying the experience i bought a cheep delongi espresso machine to see if it wa something i wa going to enjoy and want to continue with the idea wa to sell the machine after a while and drop some money on a proper machine luckily the bad experience did not put me off but it doe put many people off and then they never want to buy another espresso machine such a shame that these product exist and i am sure there only purpose is so cause problem buyer remorse and to stop people actually getting in to espresso and enjoying the whole experience i like the price point round up video because it much easier compare what quality is available at that price point hey james why do not you try cheap gaggia machine wit 58 mm portafilter bro no offense but you sound like your breath smell like death i had an older version of the delonghi a my first espresso machine it did not come with an unpressurized basket so i ordered one from a different company and had to bend the top flat so it would fit in the delonghi portafilter i replaced the panarello steam wand with a traditional steam wand silvia v2 steam wand i think and used a baratza sette 270 grinder with it i eventually cut the bottom off of the portafilter and made it into a bottomless it would occasionally make good espresso but wa such a pain to use i upgraded to a gaggia classic a few year ago and man what a difference next up for me will probably be an appartamento but that is year away killer t shirt little color correction hiccup at 8 56 otherwise really cool video always enjoy watching these yeah my machine won delonghi is relatively ok but really unstable i bought it year ago when i knew nothing about coffee i am just holding onto it and saving money for a better machine hi james i presume that you will be covering a lot of different price point in the machine that you will be covering in the future if possible could you some kind of value for money scale what i mean is a lot of people would not spend over euros1000 probably not even over euros500 for a machine to make a morning latte cappuccino you know that espresso drinker are not buying these machine i am just wondering what is the best cheap espresso machine that if you encountered in a friend is house would make you think twice about just asking for a cup of tea i have got the krups i had a different experience it took me some time but i started pulling quite good shot people having these coffee machine and enjoying the hell out of it not understanding why he complains looking forward to a budget espresso recommendation vid when i order coffee from 3fe and the like i need to order moccapot aero press grind to use on my home espresso machine it simply can not handle the fine shop espresso grind am i even making espresso or just wasting good coffee i use a delonghi dedica at gbp189ish have you tried gaggia classic you can soetimes get it refubrished for just over 100gbp apart from having a decent build it is also upgradable thought mr hoffman please take a look at atomic espresso maker it is some sort of stovetop espresso witcher is that also cream the milk those make moka not espresso hey what is the grinder thanks for the review james and for protecting u from those dreadful pun i would guessed sub ton machine were cr p so have avoided them assiduously i realise you have probably already set your price ceiling for your next test but i would like to see the best machine under gbp500 finding out if it is possible using good prep to produce good espresso every time at that price point cheer and ta for reading sometimes i am tempted to buy something like this and then i stick to the mokka pot for now clever strategy a you know even when you got the 600euros for machine you have to have nearly the same to the grinder james what kind of coffee did you use if you are not comfortable telling what exactly at least what type also please would you say that in future video also james you did not strike me a a marc rebillet fan good on you man james reallllyyyy like the niche would love it if you could do a review on the best machine and grinder to buy at the lowest cost i really want to get myself a machine and grinder once i have some some space but do not know what to buy and do not want to spend an arm and a leg on the set up  5 28 i literally had to pause the video and digest that moment for a second answer buy a second hand gaggia classic off ebay and then drop the opv pressure to 9bar and fit a pid winner winner chicken dinner i think the delonghi gave you the best result because you used properly ground espresso with a proper basket the issue with the rest is you are using properly ground espresso with an improper basket which i think make the result a bit inaccurate i would be more curious to see if those cheaper machine gave you a better result with a more coarsely ground espresso like it is designed to work with i have been using a delonghi machine for about 10 year now it doe have a pressurised filter but loaded with well tamped finely ground coffee it will produce a pretty decent espresso the tamper incidentally look identical to the modern one it simply pull out of the machine and is much more usable that way although it is still a rather puny plastic effort for something that cost under gbp100 somewhere between 2009 and 2010 that delonghi ha done remarkably well i thought you were a man of fine taste from your love of coffee but i know you are a man of fine taste from your shirt any possibility of including a breville sage duo temp pro in one of these review series d j brew i am really happy with delonghi ec685 i find it is best for the money james love your channel and your coffee bean have you ever reviewed the gaggia classic a it wa always rumoured to be the best affordable machine for home use i wondered how much it is changed now it carry a heavier price tag and the adjustable opv changed out for a fixed spring valve i have one of the previous gen machine with a brass brewhead ims screen rancillio steam wand and a auber instrument pid i am considering an upgrade soon to something that more gradually build brew pressure though i have recently gotten some decent result using 21g filter basket to allow a slower pressure build during the brew oh what a shame i didnt know they removed the opv from the new pro model i had a gaggia classic a my travel machine for a little while it wa one of the limited edition gold model and i got it for dollar200 i used it to bring a machine with me on vacation and also should my main machine ever fail me i had a proper machine a a backup honestly it not the best machine ever but it totally capable with some effort if you can adjust thebrew pressure and then learn how to properly temp surf the machine if you have a proper grinder it definitely capable of good espresso i do not think it capable of great espresso maybe every 10th shot would be great but good espresso all day long the downside is the home espresso market ha exploded and the gaggia classic is starting to get a little long in the tooth fwiw i have got one of later gc pro s the spring is no prob gbp10 and 20mins and i have got a 9bar machine bit sad that gaggia want 400 sheet and the pressure is not adjustable not very pro imho actually i use gaggia evolution i think gaggia doe not produce them anymore but if you search enough you can still find brand new one with 58 mm portafilter and non pressurized basket it can really make espresso it doe not have selonoid valf or pid but first shot is acceptable for really cheap machine i use seramic hand grinder looking forward for your video mentioned 9 42 came for the coffee stay for the marc rebillet tshirt you sir have my respect i try to steer people away from these device it is not available yet but i would be inclined to suggest the flair neo that should be coming out and it doe fly under your 100gbp price big up for the marc rebillet t shirt this video put a big smile on my face hilarious i have been on a very brief journey of coffee machine purchasing i started first of all with the delonghi bc065bs no pump just steam pressurised it worked but it wa utter garbage i used it for two week and it ended up being the work filter coffee machine i then bought a proper pump machine the magimix l expresso which at the time i wa very pleased with it made what i thought wa good coffee and i used it for a good few year at this point my interest and a little spare cash coincided and i decided it wa time to upgrade there wa a lot of researching balancing on what i could afford against bang for buck i wanted the rancillo silvia but if i bought that i could not afford a grinder so i settled and for the last 8 year i have been using an iberital mc2 grinder and an original gaggia classic no pressurised basket the gaggia ha had one failed part the switch flew across the room one day scaring the life out of me and a few upgrade brass shower head plate better shower screen and a pid thermostat the iberital choked on a stone hidden in some bean and needed a new gear but that is all i have done i am still happy with my coffee someone is probably laughing at me right now thinking i have not really had a good coffee i know what i am going to say might be crazy but i think a nespresso and refillable coffee capsule would give you a better result in the sub gbp100 range whats the best price point for an espresso machine like when doe it get to a point where oging up in price get you diminishing return please continue this series with a gbp200 option he is the fantano of coffee i have a pressurized basket with my delonghi dedica and a i went to search for whether grind size or tamping mattered this video popped up good timing but now i need to see if i can find a non pressurized basket i guess his voice is so calming he is the david attenborough of coffee some say he is also known a david caffienborough right he sound like a weirdly chill lindybeige aahahahahahah can not un hear it now he is a normal person living in this world i learned espresso on a modified ec702 i gutted the portafilter and bought a new basket to bypass the pressurized one that modification along with an ordered tamper and secondhand rancilio md50 grinder are what ha led to to where i am today it wa frustrating finicky and not a good user experience but it made good espresso when effort care and time wa put into it since then i switched a a vintage la pavoni europicola that i refurbished i still dislike my routine it is clunky can not support multiple beverage for company and i have grown to really dislike this grinder but it is my setup and i love it please do a review of the rancilio silvia so are there any easy mod to these home user could do to make them better hi james how about the milk steamer in every machine it would be also interesting to know the performance of the steamer thx i wa desperately hoping for a another plague doctor reference but the jeff dis wa most satisfying i use my flair for espresso for around the same money at the time i bought it i have a smeg coffee machine can you please do a review james i need to know if it is good i have a de longhi for about two year now it is been sitting on a shelf for the past few month coz i started to experiment with v60 it is coming down soon for the variety sake but anyway it doe a good job i think i figured it out i am using a normal lavazza espresso preground coffee and wa grand a nice show of support for marc rebillet how about a series of video on modding a gaggia classic even a 2nd hand pre 2015 machine or silvia take it from stock to pimp with a pid opv and steam wand mod see how far you can take an entry level machine james with this it might be interesting to see what you would put together for a espresso ish or espresso milk drink experience for gbp100 would you still choose the delonghi over some of the espresso ish method using aeropress prismo etc or even some of the moka pot approximation i would like to know that too where doe aeropress or delter stand against it hello i am kinda new to this coffee making world i have only been drinking coffee for about 4 year last year i bought the cookworks espresso machine from argo for around gbp55 like i said i am kinda new to this but i find this machine great to me it is great but to someone like yourself you would probably shake your head scratch it and say right ok here is where you went wrong i could be wrong but i like this coffee machine i also do not buy the best if the best bean or grinder a like i have said i am new to this coffee way of life great video and keep them coming especially to educate me i started my coffee latte espresso journey on cheap a chinese nock off delonghi and i have to say i loved it a it trained me more than any good machine could by making me search for non pressurise basket for it modifying my milk head to single point steaming wand etc so i could recommend something like that to someone who interested more about learning to pull great coffee shot but for average user who just want easy and great tasting espresso no great interesting video james would love to see a review of the flair neo if you can get your hand on it coffee aside supporting marc rebillet asserts your status a a man of culture video did not even fully load yet first thing that i saw wa his shirt manuelsen look at his t shirt and where doe he do that norape went to make this comment found it at the top i do not usually thump up on video but this one wa good and i really hope you will follow up on the next tire and until you find a good price quality balance i wa considering a breville barista either pro express or touch but they are a bit above what i consider to be sane to spend on kitchen appliance ok to be honest i love almost all of your video and try and remember to like them i have a different de longhi to the one you reviewed albeit more expensive but i came with only pressurised basket i only learnt about these after having the machine for about a year when i started to grind my own coffee knock hand grinder and realised the machine just could not hack the fine espresso grind a gbp3 chinese 51mm normal basket purchase and a little hack sawing later and my espresso game is way better probs not to your standard but still cheer for all the great content started with a cheap delonghi and sage grinder after a few week i got the bezzera bz13 pid and a baratza sette 270wi when that came out absolutely no comparison but without an entry level machine i would not have made the decision to upgrade i have the andrew james machine and while it made a shoddy espresso dark roasted columbian bean ground a fine a my hario mill would take them it balanced out when topping the drink up to make an americano the real point of failure for me wa actually the steam wand truly a hideous experience barely producing enough pressure to froth the milk ending up with an over milky coffee with approximately 0 texture this wa a purchase made at the start of my coffee journey when the bulk of my budget had already gone on filter coffee equipment definitely can not recommend using it especially when an aeropress can make better tasting espresso ish and that ha the bonus of making excellent long coffee too long comment is long tl dr andrew james machine is garbage yes please minimum effective requirement i clicked on this video and the ad that popped up wa for nespresso in my finest james hoffman trying the oil from a centrifuged espresso voice i exclaimed oh no all i have access to is a cheap machine a capresso ec 110 which ha given me some pretty good shot of espresso however the caveat to that is the issue of consistency it just is not consistent trying to get the best shot i possibly can from it is frustrating but i love to play around with it and have fun trying to get just the right grind and pressure to get the best shot i can usually take about 3 try and then it dialed in for a while and i get good coffee for a bit and then it wont take the grind or the pressure is too much or it leak around the portafilter from the group head but it give me just enough good coffee to not want to throw it in the trash i think it know i would love to see a video on machine in the 250euros 450euros range yes please post about the bare minimum machine to have good coffee amp experience thank you for doing this series after seeing your review of the olympia express cremina i thought good espresso would always be out of range i have had a cheap krupp and a mid range delonghi and i even tweeted you about mid range espresso machine dollar200 dollar400 i look forward to the next installment i wa thinking about buying one of these cause they cost 1500 in my country i will stay happy with my moka pot after that video so now that you mentioned this decent little grinder im dying to know what it is i need one the best reviewer i had seen is that a marc rebillet shirt i see  any chance of you reviewing testing the flair neo looking forward to the bare minimum video for every hobby it is always best to save up for something that doe a decent or good job otherwise you just get frustrated with a cheap version and do not enjoy the hobby a much a you used to plus just the throwing away of money what is the cup thing that he is grinding into i have used a delonghi with unpressurized portafilter with a good grinder make a good coffee considering the price for beginner it a good machine now i am on a db lelit james rocking the loopdaddy merch from my own experience i suspect you will have a hard time beating a flair classic and an aergrind for price to performance ratio even though it is a quite a process this is sadly where i am at right now ekeing out what i can while preparing for a real upgrade skipping over the gcp entry level and to at least hx if not db current machine klarstein passionata also seen it badged branded a capresso ec100 hamilton beach melita homix and beem it is a thermoblock and is very similar to the delonghi krupp and swan retro above in fact it share the exact same pressurized basket and plastic wand tamper i pair it with a serviceable virtuoso which give me about 7 8 espresso grind step my first step wa to depressurize the portafilters but have since just bought a non pressurized basket from amazon that certainly helped immensely my next ideal mod however not sure if it is possible a i have not found a way and documentation is sorely lacking would be to lower the pressure from 15 bar to 9 bar unfortunately like a couple of the machine in the video i get a minor jet stream that cause channeling it appears unrelated to the shower screen although i have considered replacing that too i do not even want to talk about the thought of temp surfing or piding the thermoblock all in all i pull fine shot not great that mostly just end up in iced latte i just live with the fomo that come along with not getting everything out of my trade subscription the one positive i have learned a lot about the process and creating consistency in the step i can control it is also proven to myself based on sustained daily use that this is a hobby i enjoy and want to get better at thus justifying the cash outlay for a significan not upgrade investment if the electric appliance that are up to dollar 100 are making bad espresso then why not buy a macchinetta james very informative video thank you what do you think of the illy espresso capsule paired with the retro francis francis machine would love your opinion on the lower end delonghi bean to cup machine will you ever review capsule based espresso machine finalmentte i have the mr coffee caf barista dollar180 the milk drink are pretty good but the straight espresso is really finicky and come out horrendously sour 1 3 of the time i have tried grinding my own buying espresso ground and messing with dosage and tamping it come with one of those plastic tamper scoop too i also can not tell if it is a pressurized basket there is a rubber gasket inside but the bottom ha a removable plastic ring for cleaning if you could dissect a mr coffee machine it would be a good video for those of u who are can spend a little more to dip our toe into espresso but can not commit to dollar500 of equipment this is great i have had a delonghi ec155 for a few year now back then it wa pressurized a well but i cut the handle bottom off and replaced the portafilter with a 15g regular one and it pull very similar to the one you have there i am looking to upgrade and am very interested in your next video where you look at what the minimum for great espresso is thanks so much and can not wait i did the same with my delonghi and worked quite well the main problem wa the size of the basket that it could only hold 14g flair espresso might be the closest budget with decent result i have been on the fence about buying an espresso machine at home but i think i am better off just making simple pour over coffee at home and leaving the espresso to the professional at my local coffee shop my question is if i only need a machine for milk drink is a budget unit capable of making good espresso but not great espresso perfectly adequate for my need can you review flair espresso and any hand powered machine below 300 pound i use flair in my shop idk if it proper thanks for the video james it is nice to have someone who is not paid to rattle off a false review james please could you test if these machine are good to froth milk all of them seem yo have that feature perhaps that might be a slightly redeeming factor for them i wonder if designer of these machine ever actually made an espresso in their life i am not talking about temperature and pressure control those are expensive to build properly but all those totally unergonomic decision which could be made better at the same price james this is a great way of educating the public so that people avoid falling into the trap of buying cheap good and then being extremely disappointed thank you and looking forward to seeing another video on machine maybe in the gbp300 gbp500 range i have been dying for a video about an inexpensive espresso machine looking forward to that i would really like to see that bare minimum espresso machine you talked about please review nespresso machine and coffee i do not think you have done it yet a i can not find any breville barista express is the it make me sad that this wa made in the first place thanks jeff that line had me dying say barista express a a minimum espresso machine then buy a decent grinder under gbp200 please de longhi dedica style hi james my first and unfortunately still current machine is the delonghi ecp33 21 that i bought for exactly gbp100 a few year ago terrible choice yes but i did not know what i wa getting into so i wanted to learn the basic skill instead of going head first and grab the best equipment of course the first thing i immediately realised after the purchase wa how hard it is to get the grind consistency i want using a blade grinder so i bought an entry level grinder called graef cm702 for another gbp100 soon after i also found a gbp8 non pressurized basket that fit the 51mm portafilter although i needed to unscrew the plastic inside after that i finally had some satisfaction pulling good shot unassisted by the pressurised basket but it did not take long before the inconsistency of the tool started to become a wall and i never found the reason nor courage to explore beyond the lavazzas and sicals of espresso bean because the shot i wa pulling were too inconsistent i would probably waste about 40percent of the bag just from bad shot and adjustment dial in do not seem to be relevant for very long and the constant troubleshooting process becomes exhausting after a while it is funny that i am most passionate about espresso but always found simpler happier experience with pourovers and french press my first brew wa the floral fruity fresh panama boquete via a v60 which note i still reminisce up to this day so i am looking forward to your next buyer is guide video especially at the gbp300 gbp400 range one of the machine upgrade i have been eyeing for a deal on for a long time is the lelit anna pl41lem pl41tem boiler conventional steam wand never quite liked the cappucino modern style frother the end froth seems to be too airy and especially the one that came with my machine is a pain in the arse to clean you have to take it apart and scrub them everytime because the milk get stuck in weird corner and the wall in the frother even after you flushed it sexy lever switch clean look comfortably sized pid for the tem variant and seems like a robust little machine go for euros430 but stock seems to not always be available p s if you have actually read this i might a well go ahead and get a few question in 1 thermoblock v boiler is it really worth the price difference i found a dual thermoblock machine that go for around gbp550 just above the pricepoint for entry level boiler machine with no immediately obvious shortcoming and wa wondering if the convenience and price outweighs the difference in feature and quality anyway 2 are those built in grinder in espresso machine actually any good is the difference in grind quality worth the space saving and the price 3 am i crazy or bean from the same bag really do need grind adjustment a they lose freshness i already suspect my 40 grind setting too cheap to be true grinder but it seems to work great for a few day then need a step up or two to get the same grind profile i am conflicted on whether it is something i have to be personally mindful of or is it time for an upgrade 4 what do you think about the moisture buildup for frozen bean i find that moisture build up even after double bagging my bean with zipbags james calling his patron his patreons prof he is the best youtuber that is because the patreon website call them that and not patron then there is the aeropress for 28 while there ha been improvement on kit for home espresso i still recommend espresso at a shop and filter coffee at home then there should be decent coffee shop near by people put 1500euros on tv set but espresso kit should cost max 100e put 1500euros on espresso and let tv be the old coffee pilgrim well yes if we are talking sub gbp100 machine at home spend some gbp200 more i would prefer to be drinking espresso at home gbp25 dulce gusto pod machine with a gbp9 metal refillable pod is my setup i so want this guy to review it the sheer entertainment value please speaking of pressurized portafilters i would love to see you take a look at the flair neo it is flair is new inexpensive manual espresso maker it is interesting because you can upgrade to a proper portafilter later on if you get a good grinder i did not even think that you would say deja brew but now i will expect you to say deja brew great video james i nearly bought a cheap machine at christmas but ended up spending more based on your review and expertise and ended buying a sage barista express i love it and find the whole experience enjoyable i also have a regular subscription to a coffee company where i get 2 roaster choice every 3 week this also make it interesting trying the different coffee and different grind required epic you got thai version of your book i had a delonghi a my first machine it wa entertaining sometimes it could pull a decent shot unpressurized however i eventually found that the rate of bad shot wa so great that using the pressurized filter wa preferable so it wa a good introduction to making espresso but it wa a bad purchase overall well i think it still did better than a moka pot though please test the bambino plus product that are causing global warming round 2 tl dr buy an espressoforge way ahead of you i am a coffee lover and i can not get my head around why i have never been into coffee youtube instant subscribe looking forward to catching up on what i can only imagine based on this example is sterling content thanks for the video james i currently own a gaggia classic started with a machine like the krups when i still had the krups i used an angle grinder to saw off the bottom part of the pressurized basket and turned it into a non pressurized basket it did make a slight improvement thank you i have been waiting for expresso machine review video from you since i discovered your channel looking forward to the next one i am in the process of picking a espresso machine hey james i would love tou see you try cheap end gaggia and lelit product the one made for home user i especially have my eye on gaggia is new classic pro lelit anna flair commandate c40 grinder show me a setup that is better value for money you can not flair can pull shot on par with gbp3k machine and the commandante match the gbp2 5k ek43 giant slayer i would like to see a video on this setup doe aybody know what grinder this is idk 100 pound is pretty heavy and those do not look that heavy if i used euro power i would put my name in the give away and see what i could do with the internals of the machine thanks jeff lol bought a kmix espresso machine 2nd hand for about 30 pound build quality seems a lot better than the one reviewed but agree on the fact that you have to do course grind with longer brew time to get anything decent every time i have tried to go any finer machine doe not build up enough pressure to push water through the pressurized basket look forward to your opinion on the best machine for the least money have had my eye on the rancilio silvia for the longest time will be interested to know if there is anything better at that price why do you do this to yourself i think some entry level gaggia around 150euros can maybe make good espresso i would be interested to find out how about a video with dare i say it automatic espresso machine like for example the one from saeco siemens etc love your vids btw what i would like to know is how they steam milk i tried the cheap delonghi the medium breville barista express and the delonghi magnifica i had a very hard time making good milk with both delonghi the breville worked very well i am not an expert so this might be due to me you can always buy used my first decent machine wa a saeco aroma and while it is not a top tier machine it doe make great coffee after removing the pressurized bit i think i paid dollar150 usd total including shipping and tax that machine wa used for 7 8 year and is now my backup machine cause it still work great i also added a heat probe to the boiler to get a better sense of temp great video i am wondering if you have one on grinder or plan on making one please please please do a similar comparison of grinder specifically it is commonly known that you get better shot with a more expensive grinder but what is unclear is where lie the point of diminishing return while a dollar500 grinder may well be twice a good a a dollar250 grinder can the same be said when comparing a dollar1000 grinder to dollar500 and what is to be gained by spending dollar2000 this video could be costly if you try to answer this question across all price range but surely some guidance could be found at the bottom end of the price range second hand gaggia classic blow all these out the water great video looking forward to your future video really want to find out what machine is the most worth it for people who are just starting out making espresso and do not have a lot of money to spend about 8 year ago i bought a delonghi electric steam brewer at a thrift store for about dollar6 usd i knew nothing about espresso and the espresso i got wa awful but it wa fun over time i have learned and gotten better and got a better grinder coffee and now i can actually get something drinkable from it the other day i pulled something that wa decently rounded nutty and a little sweet not overly bitter or sour it even had a little crema on top it is still far from perfect but it is introduced me to a fun hobby that i really enjoy i do plan to get a real espresso machine a soon a i can afford it would you consider not supporting amazon i did lol when you said thanks jeff though this is the video series that we needed for espresso i would like to see a review of the breville sage infuser this seems like the budget sweet spot with a pid three way solenoid valve and traditional steaming wand you have so much experience please made a espresso machine i saw a gbp50 espresso machine in lidl and i am not going to lie i wa almost morbidly curious enough to buy it i have the delonghi ec155 since 2017 i use it pretty regularly also it wa my first espresso machine and you are right the ready light can be true or the most horrifying lie in the history of morning coffee it took me 3 month of daily use to understand it i think these machine are good for your first espresso machine and to understand how important are the people working in coffee shop i would say the rancilio silvia is the cheapest machine that will give you a great espresso experience if you temperature surf otherwise i heard the gaggia classic which is cheaper should enable a good espresso also i do not think i qualify to judge good coffee a i add milk and sugar but ive always wondered about that pricepoint of machine so thank you for letting me know how they work out 5 31 my favorite james quip so far nice video if you are looking at the bare minimum i wonder what your take is on the gaggia classic pro what is your opinion on sage barista express i had a charles bentley machine and the consistence is awful although it wa around 50 pound when i got it but it is totally not worth it i am thinking to switch for a better one would love for you to recommend the best price to machine ratio great video james it would be very interesting to know your opinion on the sage duo temp and similar machine they are at about 350gbp i think that is about the minimum what do you think is the breville sage low end machine rom under gbp100 yes is doe have a pressurized filter but i am curious what you think of it bro thank you very much i just started drinking the real coffee not instant after watching your video please keep guide u newbie i am overwhelmed with your video and can not afford to buy everything you recommend i have the delonghi it is decent enough i agree the little arm to hold the basket in place is terrible and i hate the tamper i am saving up for a breville instead of what is the best machine if like to see what is the best budget set up of machine grinder and accessory can i do this for le than 300 i bought the breville sage cafe rom cheapest breville espresso machine didnt enjoy the experience i realized after using it i would have been better off getting a more expensive machine this brings up another question what is the most cost effective way to make a decent espresso at home i would imagine a hand grinder and some sort of hand press thing but i think that might be an interesting or at least useful video i think that is what all u broke coffee lover want to know with a few mod the delonghi dedica is a sleeper machine i have a cheaper machine with a pressurised basket the ground always come out pretty soupy doe that mean channelling so again we find out that people from coffee forum are full of b how an earth you got this a result of the video d how so i do not feel like that is the takeaway here had a small pressurized portafilter machine and the espresso i got out of this wa okay ish but it wa a you described the first one fine but a bit dull 3 bought an isomac tea and a decent grinder and finally have good espresso at home the de longhi wa my first machine and got the job done for me until i went further down the rabbit hole in the hobby mine wa an older ec155 and did not come with a non pressurized basket this wa easily fixed using a la pavoni millennium basket i also purchased a 52mm tamper and that alone tremendously improved the shot quality you did not really talk about the steam wand but i swapped out the stock one with a rancilio silvia v1 v2 wand and with some practice wa able to produce some great result for latte art have since moved on to a silvia and a nuova simonelli but will always have a soft spot for the de longhi would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to get their foot wet in home espresso i had a delonghi before when i changed to non pressurized it made a world of difference then it had to go never look back d save a little get a gaggia classic pro best starter machine primarily interested in which frother work best among those want to make a good home latte imo the real espresso journey start at euros350 where you can find lelit gaggias isomacs or even rancilio in a lucky day machine with proper boiler portafilters and basket also capable of producing great steam for milk drink that will be a great subject i hope you can address it sometime soon take care man somewhat unpleasant gt broadly unpleasant gt deeply unpleasant please could you try to find what is the least amount of money someone must spend to get good espresso what grinder do you use this ha an extra filter me ooh thats handy i do not know why this is there i do not like it me yeah f you swan the power of authority to an indecisive me d reminds me of indecisive dave lol hey james thank you for being such a fantastic resource for u an idea i would really love to see is a review of some machine with grinder built in i am curious a to how quality they may be something like the breville barista express or delonghi la specialista for me personally i would rather one unit that i can work at than several machine but not at the expense of quality he ha done it from previous video i would guess james ha no love for built in grinder i think the video on robotic pour over machine ha a machine with a built in grinder that he go on at length about james can you do a video comparing cheap budget grinder also would you ever do a video where you try out older grinder espresso machine from ebay and see if you can get good result love your vids just have a nice glass of water instead you should have said de ja bru that would have been kinda funny i am just going to pause the video 4 second in and conclude no because coffee on this channel must be expensive great video there are so few video on cheap espresso machine i think a lot of people including me do not have the money or just are not willing to spend several hundred pound on an espresso machine maybe an idea to do a video on how to make good espresso or coffee on a pressurized filter i know the obvious answer is get an unpressurized basket but a lot of people will want to work with what they got in my experience pressurized filter are ok if you want something more like a filter coffee with crema so long fast shot instead of an espresso the coffee you get out of a pressurized filter is a lot more like the bean to cup robot you find everywhere these day i have a delonghi ec685 and i have a non pressurized portafilter i am buying freshly roasted coffee from a local shop and grinding with a hario mini slim pro coffee grinder i am getting pretty nice shot but i can say that they are not perfectly consistent also i have a request i would like to upgrade my machine and buy a nice grinder so can you please do a similar video with machine that are under 200 or maybe 300 pound thanks for the video it is really nice at my studio i have a dualit machine more than gbp100 but not much krups grinder i make many flat white from it and although it is not sophisticated i find it is reasonably consistent perhaps it is one you could test i found not tamping give the best result it may be cool to see a tear down of one of these v a good one you could point out the design difference hi james wonderful video something that i have personally been experimenting on for a while would love if u could just do a little hack and see whr tht go the reason i am saying this is coz i have a real cheap machine exact same 51 52 mm pressurised portafilters and tht horrible plastic tampoon i do have a decent grinder though baratzza sette30 i also have a confession to make the grinder wa purchased after subscribing to ur channel and the unquestionably best investment for my daily espresso so thank you so i tried a hack orderd a proper sized non pressurised portafilter from amazon india a i live in india along with a similar sized 500gms steel tamper both together costed me roughly equivalent to 20gbp tried various grind setting to get 22gms in max supported by tht portafilter and 44 out i measure each time in roughly 26 to 30 sec and the result were literally mind blowing could not imagine just 20pound worth of investment would transform the espresso so much plz try you will be genuinely surprised i promise u posting amazon india link for the tamper generic stainless steel powder pressing force coffee tamper 51mm espresso bean press and the portafilter basket non pressurised fdit coffee non pressurized filter basket strainer stainless steel coffee machine accessory coffee filter for breville i regularly work with italian they use the delonghi with illy coffee i always get the same decent espresso in plastic cup of course it is not a good a at home but they are doing well within the mean they have i really wan na know the follow up what the bare minimum recommendation is exactly what i want please do this do you think you could do a series on bare minimum coffee essential quality hand grinder electric grinder espresso machine quality milk frothers or milk steamer maybe two manual grinder at different price point great content a always i would love to see you review super automatic machine like the gaggia brera are machine like that ever worth buying thanks for your great honest review really enjoy them i have one that is near identical to the amazon basic one it wa a gift to me since they knew i wa a huge fan of coffee and making coffee in new way it wa ok for latte is but the foamer wa very very poor in my opinion have since moved to pour over style primarily i have had the delongi for over 4 year now i have made thousand of cup of coffee with it and it still function like it did when i bought it if nothing else it is a very stubborn machine my first espresso machine wa a mr coffee that cost 40 usd i knew it wa not capable of real espresso but i just wanted something i could make some milk drink with since it had a steam wand it had some of the flaw you stated here where it carved a channel the size of the grand canyon into the ground the biggest thing that i notice now that i have a real machine is the face that it come with a 20 ounce carafe it wa a 3 bar espresso machine designed to push 600 ml of water through a 15 20g puck of coffee awful doe not begin to describe it i use a modified version of the older revision of that delonghi machine non pressurized basket and bottomless portafilter modification fix that espresso retention problem the steam wand is also replaceable with a real wand so you can actually get good steamed milk and not a frothy mess absolutely love the marc ribillet shirt interesting and enlightening i will save my money and maybe someday purchase a machine that is both capable and enjoyable to use i am looking forward to your video review on machine in that bracket you have already inspired me to buy and try a moka pot and wow with some nice colombian pre ground a i have not worked up to splurging on a grinder it is opened my eye to how good coffee can taste compared with what i would been buying from big brand coffee shop thank you i bought a used breville duo temp with a capresso infinity grinder for around dollar60 i bought a nonpressurized basket and a decent tamper for it i like it and i feel it get a good shot once in a while i think my tamp is the more inconsistent thing but i think you can get decent result from it if you know what you are doing here is a question and sorry if it already been asked but what is the cheapest espresso machine that doe consistently make good coffee this will be cheeky but even after getting super into coffee i still like my nespresso machine every so often i had a dualit coffee machine but it would leak water every now and then so now own a nespresso machine le mess and better quality mine a nespresso sage creatista plus i am more curious about the bean is that a medium roast you are using james currently i am experimenting with medium roast arabica bean and i found it to be very sour i grind it fine for espresso but the sourness is just punching me at the first sip i always brew a darker roast by the way are we better off with a brikkapot mokapot than spending that much for a machine that make crap espresso can not wait for the next level group test i have a broken machine and a purchase coming up self interested but would love to see what you think is the most cost effective decent machine is i have yet to take the plunge into home espresso looking forward to your recommendation for the bare minimum for an enjoyable tasty espresso at home thank you for your work james i have always wondered why there wa such a large gap between espresso machine now i know yes from 60e gt 8000e do these company not have engineer any recommendation for sub 200 had the delonghi for 2 year wa 65 gbp the quality and consistency if ever wa there faded away after a year of so wa hit and miss every time i have a gbp200 300 ish budget right now i would be interested to see what you say at that price point i think i will keep saving though so strange that they think it is hard enough to get espresso ground coffee that they need to put pressurized filter even if you do not grind your own i have seen espresso ground coffee even at target and my local coffee shop will grind for you at any setting you request frequently use this for gift this work not it is like welding gas pedal in your car to nice setting you have to have adjustability and furthermore the pressurised filter are partly just fot that grinding coffee you need grinder to have ability to espresso and adjustability the espresso grinded stuff in market is mainly mokapot grind anyway but this is good point hoffmann could do series for cheapest grinder to espresso working one nobody want too expensive one that is quite cheap appr 600e he us on this video i did a test with a market grinded stuff the first time i bought a delonghi in 2014 it broke did not have a great first impression and had to take it back for a replacement to this day i still have my replacement delonghi machine but like you say it is finniky to use it take 10 minute to make a coffee and 2 minute to drink this for me is a ritual hobby to enjoy on a day off work be interesting to see a test of nespresso machine with the reusable pod it taste ffffffine but just managed to buy a rok 2nd hand for about the same price a these but i do not have a grinder that is good enough for espresso is the next best thing to upgrade the grinder to the baratza encore wilfa svart also around gbp120 ish or something else your thought please would like to see a test of the smeg espresso machine have not found any only a few written review anyone who have any experience dc1arkson interesting thanks for your answer yeah the grinder is important what would you say is the main reason for looking at sage not the smeg joatjim i have had one for around 2 year now and managed to make a good espresso although i a good grinder which help but i am thinking for a little more a sage would be a lot better can you make video in the future exploring different range like dollar150 next and so on i love the idea of exploring the bare minimum for people on a budget i do not know if they are available in uk or elsewhere but in usa i had great experience with gaggia evolution over more than a decade we have owned two we liked first one so much that we brought it along on camping and it fell and broke in a camper both came at the price just about 100 pound equivalent 129dollar there is a claim which from the usage i believe but you a the expert can check if true that the crucial internal machinery is identical to the 4x price gaggia classic it work a swiss watch doe all fundamental good espresso bit and no problem doe not survive few hour of tossing about on the camper floor great video a always james looking forward to your video on the best minimum espresso machine it is next to add on my collection of coffee brewing stuff so far i have v60 chemex aeropress mocha pot french press and finally a filter coffee machine let is me time it for if i am i know i will be in a rush in the morning if you click the link for the delonghi it is out of stock amazon suggests the andrew james because they hate u great vid how about best setup for sub gbp500 this could include all in one machine so i realize that you seem to drink coffee without milk or cream but could you please maybe do a taste test or maybe just inform u about the flavored coffee creamer on the market and how you feel about them also the best way of getting to the point of drinking just black coffee i have gotten off of adding sugar but the cream is hard to quit i loved that pun tho what grinder are you using david i am not even going to entertain the idea of investing in espresso at home until i am in a place where i would rather spend dollar2000 that use my v60 out of curiosity what coffee do you use to make espresso agree that sub gbp300 would be very interesting when the cafelat robot aboutgbp300 wa reviewed i wondered is that the best home espresso for that money would be great to see how it stack up against the sage bambino plus smeg ecf 2nd hand gaggia even i have been really looking forward to this video ever since my old delonghi broke i have been on the watch for a cheap replacement because i did not have much money to spend it would be great if you could compare a couple of machine in the next price segement in the future because i think i am glad i did not go for the 100 buck delonghi seeing how flimsy it look in real life thanks a lot i cackled when you demoed the water coming out of the krups 1 result is horrible 2 the sand color is one look very cute would love to know your general recommendation for at home espresso machine above 100 obviously not interested in these on the list where do you begin with recommendation for home espresso machine that are quality yeah he hinted at this doing some more review to find that sweet spot of cheap a possible but with the greatest possible product i wa hoping this would miraculously be that video thanks james i look forward to your future video a i have been looking to buy a machine amp simply find it difficult to figure out which one to get for now i will stick to my moka pot i used to have the delonghi it wa difficult to get something good out of it and i had no idea tamper were not usually attached to the machine that used to irritate the hell out of me would love to see a review of some of the built in coffee machine my girlfriend got me the delonghi a a birthday present the coffee taste good just on sentimental principal but over time i have gotten good result after using it quite a bit i can not wait for the future video where james tell me i can not make good espresso without spending over dollar1000 bloody hell i got this de longhi or a very very similar one almost identical to be honest and it came with two pressurized basket would you recommend a used machine like a gaggia classic when you go for round two could you look at the gaggia classic pro i currently have the delonghi ec155 college present and after a lot of effort i have found a way to get good tasting espresso is something like a pid some temperature gauge necessary im very excited to see the rest of these entry level series video spencjon if it help i went from a delonghi to a classic pro recently wa a bit of a learning curve but quite a step up i get more intense espresso than i did got the d longi sp previous version is the bomb better coffee than costa i have a machine with the same messy steam water dispersion problem namely the koenic kem 2320 literally the amazon basic machine but with programmable button and managed to easily solve the issue you can screw out the little metal screen that sits in the group head and see a single hole under it right next to the screw where all the steam come out so i cut a little strip of aluminium foil laid it into the metal screen lined it up to cover the hole and now water come out like a charm dispersion is not perfect but the channeling and spraying is no more i also bought an unpressurized basket off of amazon edit made a video about it for everyone interested monicorpse i wa thinking of this today trying scott rao is double filter method for some coffee that wa not behaving i wonder if that method even with cheap tissue paper might be another simple hack for reducing channelling with unpressurised basket with cheap machine monicorpse sweet meysam moosavian it is up on my channel monicorpse looking forward to that video very interesting currently got a delonghi that doe the job paid half price do i miss my melitta no would i buy a lever machine olympia cremina for 3250 euro no think i would spend 100 quid on greggs breakfast and get free coffee bad a though it is if someone ha a budget of dollar100 i would totally suggest a flair neo a it the pressurized version of the original flair enabling people to use lower quality grinder and not have a many issue dialing espresso in manual style machine are totally the way to go for budget see wal mart ha under dollar60 espresso maker watch this video i am saving up for a sage thanks for general explanation really made up my mind my parent own a cheap espresso machine not one of the one you showed but pretty similar and everything about it is disappointing even to someone like me who ha not really gotten into cofee a a hobby it is pretty inconsistent you never know how much you are gon na get and it break regularly not a good experience at all now i said i have not really gotten into this a a a hobby beacuse it is a bit confusing would you ever consider making a video geared towards beginner like me who want good coffee but maybe do not have the money or the time to spend experimenting with it how about a video on keeping your teeth white i get stained teeth from drinking coffee greaaaat video would love a review of the rancilio silvia from you a used v2 v3 can be found around 200euros easily i started with a delonghi similar to the one shown here that i received a a birthday gift i now own a much nicer espresso machine but still use the delonghi is steam wand for milk drink because the pro wand on my new machine is too scary lol got ta be honest james struggling with bad coffee product delight me more than james struggling with bad coffee drink hey jameshoffman i have been new to the homebrew coffee scene since april this year and for my 31st birthday i did by the swan retro machine however it wa the attire with the grey and wooden trim to suit my kitchen flat overall anyway so far i have managed to slow the flow rate of the coffee a it wa coming out quickly at first due to having okay decent for me burr grinder generally i do find drinking expresso by itself quite a sharp taste for me then when making a cappuccino latte i think it taste pretty good i think it is a good starter machine but i have had to learn how the machine work to try and get a nice result out of it the steam wand is a bit small and i have felt during the milk steaming process it can drop in pressure then regains it is power again halfway through still learning the whole milk art also but is it is fun and enjoyable still i am no expert but at this moment it is better than paying 2 4 pound for a coffee in a brighton cafe and i feel it is a half decent machine for me a i have a compact kitchen i have been looking into seeing if i can get a bottomless port filter for the machine to see if that ha many effect with the machine with improving the taste all the best raphael i do have a delonghi i recieved it a a gift many year ago i have not used it in a long time a i have not really had the time to i enjoyed the coffee i got out of it and i think it can serve a a good machine but nothing will ever be better than a quality espresso machine that give you full control over your brew for your bare minimum espresso at home video are you looking at the gaggia classic 2019 refresh i would love to see some honest thought on that machine it is the bare minimum i would ever look at bear in mind i am a dreamer at this point i can not afford the dual boiler machine i want yet but i still want to get into espresso at home that being said i am not going to rush into anything because i would rather not waste the money for the first time ever youtube ha prevented me from watching a video saying that it can not be played in the background despite me not actually trying to watch it in the background even holding it up to the light doe not work argh james i wa gifted a delonghi ecp 3220 3420 which is about the same a the one featured here but with a pressurized porta filter i can confirm making espresso with this thing is difficult even without any idea of what a good shot is i do not have a grinder yet but i have already learned that different pre ground coffee produce drastically different result and very fine grind choke up the shot i am new to making espresso and would appreciate a video on replacing or upgrading to a proper introductory setup what i am most interested in is the rok paired with it is grinder but i can not find a distributor for the u at the moment maybe shipping is limited due to covid19 i think it wa whole latte love who suggested a manual espresso maker a a good teaching tool can not wait to see what your bare minimum is i have what i guess is the older version of the delongi almost identical and i actually do not mind it for what i paid for it wa glad to see it came out at the top of the bunch i mainly buy pre ground coffee anyway so it doe the trick for a quick espresso i can make cappuccino with it too with the milk steamer which is nice i prefer this to my aeropress a it is just easier to setup and clean i have the delonghi ec155m and bought a none pressurized basket for it it is way better than that weird plastic rubber pressurized basket i would love to see you try some of the mod that are out there for this machine i want to hear your comparison of flair and other espresso machine of the same price range too 10 43 the question is quite existential right i mean good coffee is what i get from my local barista good coffee is the reason i pay for that coffee few time a week despite making good coffee at home every morning but if you drink my morning good coffee your face could be like what we see at 6 30 so i will not answer your question a to what a espresso machine can do for me and one of the reason why i almost purchase a espresso machine but i do not because i really do not know even if a mid range espresso machine can pull a good shot every time so for now sticking to mocha pot or pour over coffee every morning i have got a machine from the brand lelit it an italian machine and i have used it for a year now the pl41tem model wa around 480 euro and ha proven itself evensinds because of the reliability and good pid performance yes this wa great i have a brewsley machine i bought on amazon for dollar150 with a pressurized basket which i hate it kind of reminds me of the delonghi dedica but cheaply made it make halfway decent espresso but i am no expert can you make good espresso for under dollar300 dollar400 i want to continue to grow this newfound hobby obsession and i am hoping to upgrade machine soon thanks man i actually started out with a saeco poemia with a leaky wand that i got second hand for the equivalent of 25 quid i actually think that the leaky wand served a an opv and it worked it wa finnicky not the most reliable but it served it purpose i feel like having an unpressurized portafilter and a cheap machine is fine for the enthusiast on a budget the student the guy looking to save on daily latte etc it still beat out starbucks not saying much but could not compete with the e61 hx machine or pid would silviathat followed nor with a proper cafe but go second hand grab one from the person who made an impulse purchase and it is perfect a a first machine a long a the person know the tradeoff thank you for making this video a i suspected i thought i would be wasting cash on a cheap machine looked at pretty much everyone of these machine a a quick espresso option before leaving for work i will give them a miss great video thanks for doing this i look forward to seeing your next comparison video thanks for the negative review what reasonably priced machine would you recommend at 5 33 you can see james smile what a gift this video wa i had a delonghi and i thought it wa terrible idk if it wa a slightly different model than the one you have there i got it off a friend real cheap and used illy espresso what i found to be most annoying wa the amount of water that came out within a few minute you could see water in the stream and while there wa some crema it wa kind of artificial and near the end bubbly i just resolved after that to no spend money on a machine bc my dad had a better one and i could get some for free from my school coffee shop p james would you say that since these are pressurized basket espresso like and not real instead of spending dollar100 dollar200 on one of these to spend more on the grinder and sourcing bean for a good moka pot and aeropress to make espresso like drink and save up for a better machine maybe a manual like a flair or closer to a real machine like a gaggia classic or rancilio silvia if you are really getting into the hobby of espresso my brother gave me his old delonghi i have been afraid to use it because i do not want to ruin the idea of making espresso right off the bat and anything i make out of it will be worse than the pour over or aeropress that i normally make i wonder why there ha always been such a fuss about coffee being freshly brewed after it is been brewed it tasted better to me if it ha spent a day in the fridge actually i think it taste much better after a day or so i bought the delonghi ecp31 21 about a month into quarantine and a pitcher and a tamper and everything and i am quite happy with it that ec 146 b look like a uk version of the ec 155m available in the u interesting they are including a non pressurized basket i had the ec 155 back a long time ago and it had a pressurized basket only but it wa easy to swap out with a non pressurized basket a simple google search will show which basket to buy you can also buy a separate tamper not through de longhi though obviously nowhere near the level of you james but i have had pretty tasty very consistent espresso from the sowtech espresso machine which is approximately dollar64 on amazon in the u normal portafilter that can easily fit 18g and it doesnt channel the coffee brew time is about 30 second for 36 40g of espresso and it make the same coffee every time hell yeah he did this video i have got the niche zero and the delonghi dedica a cheapish machine it is a great setup and i do not see myself changing it also the look of the dedica and niche go together really well edit i did mod the dedica unpressed basket plastic taken out of the portafilter and a new good milk wand installed a few mod and it is an amazing machine it had timing and pressure changing i wonder if you looked at machine in the 100 150 range if youd see a noticeable improvement of quality took a gbp90 punt on a gumtree gaggia classic some year ago and still really enjoying it spent a bit more on a grinder though i sure hope so no one want to lug a 100 lb machine around their kitchen my first espresso machine wa a similar delonghi it wa not great but gave me the bug please do the sage barista pro to see you dial on the machine it would help verify if i am in the ball park yes i know coffee grind brew time but having a hand with my homework would be superb just do not rubbish it please make another espresso machine vid d i have a machine that is similar to the first one very much the same protifilter and although the quality of the espresso is not a good a some of my local coffee shop which i wouldnt want to replace anyway i have saved hundred of dollar by using my machine and honestly making some decent milk based drink so if you are wanting to get a machine really pay attention to what you want it for and what your primary reason for buying one is that being said i am saving for the dream of having a breville at home i am wondering can you get better result from a good hand grinder attached to a drill than a cheap burr grinder looking forward to that bare minimum entry level video i miss working a a barista and in turn the coffee but i do not want to skimp too much which grinder is being used never wa tempted by such cheap machine i used the cafelat robot for quite some time and bought the lelit bianca now in this manner i learned the basic and saved up money along the way now i use the robot at my parent is garden when i visit them and have my bianca at home it doe feel very good that way now imagine how bad it would have been with an equally cheap grinder thank you for the lesson rather enjoyable since i found myself confronted with the same question about two year ago i did some research and went with a gaggia baby from the early ninety for 80 euro these are identical on the inside with the gaggia classic of the same time but go for about half the price there is no use pretending i know a lot about espresso but i really like what i get from it and so do others so much so that my girlfriend who used to work a a barista got one for the same amount just a few month later and her friend after drinking espresso at her place bought one for herself a well my point being everybody i know who owns one including myself enjoys using it and the resulting espresso from it i also bought a gaggia mdf grinder for about the same amount also if you want to still every single part of the machine is available a a spare and the internet offer plenty of advice on fixing them i like the idea of something lasting for a while and repairing instead of replacing the gaggia is already sought after but price for working unit still seem decent might go up though if more people pick up on them anyway i appreciate the content entertainment and knowledge you provide please keep up the good work could have a pixar movie about it one day really looking forward to the upcoming video i am stuck in home office and looking for a decent espresso machine doe not need to be super cheap that can replace my daily espresso at work i can imagine that i am not the only one also doe anybody know what is the name of the grinder the spoon make me very uncomfortable and the tamper is deeply unpleasant to use really i think you would had too much caffeine today chill out and smell the coffee yes a very good expresso machine can be had for under gbp100 but an entertaining video it is can you do a similar experiment using varying price of grinder please james what grinder is that sorry for the dumb question niche zero his review here why i stick with my moka pot i like the idea of methodical coffee making but not enough to pay for an expensive machine the moka pot give me that while still giving me good coffee for dollar20 so james do i understand this right a a young person with a very limited budget stay with my moka pot until i can afford something more decent for me gbp99 99 for the delonghi is still a significan not amount that i wa thinking could enhance and speed up my morning coffee experience do you reckon i should hold off i would look around for other option than espresso have you tried a aeropress you van make strong and normal strength coffee with it or french press clever dripper etc in law have a similar delonghi the treviso have a very similar experience with it one positive thing about it relatively the tamper is not too hard to get loose so no need to keep it on the machine i had an older krupp machine possibly 1990 is it had a proper portafilter and two decently made basket it made a fairly good espresso that had a lot of body and good taste it is main issue wa heat retention but with a little bit of preparation it could be managed well i dare say that a a proud owner of a gaggia classic not the pro the classic is the gateway to decent home espresso machine not maker love your shirt saw marc live a year ago and it wa an awesome experience 5 way to make an expert suffer i received a delonghi a a birthday gift unfortunately it came with a pressurized portafilter are there workarounds to get good coffee with pressurized portafilters did u think the sage barista express is a good starting maschine something very satisfying watching you be very upset with product keep doing these please 2 15 crema simulation device have you done a video on pod machine before would be interested to hear your thought that and what your thought are on the simonelli oscar ii machine very nice see you trying the poor thing kkkkkkk i have one oster espresso machine that is similar or the same to amazon it a inconsistent machine but it ha a way to work kkkkkkkk if you have the patience to try many way to brew you will get a good espresso in the most part of the time not a excellent but good i live in brasil here the special or gourmet coffee stuff are veeery expensive so who can buy a better espresso machine is the best way but who can not be patient and try brew out of the main stream way and save money for the future i guarantee that is better than any capsule machine and a lot of coffee shop and cheaper see ya great video james i have the philco express 15 bar and it ha really frustrated me it is like krups unfortunately here in brazil we don t have a large option of espresso machine the best i can buy here is the breville infuser and the breville smart grinder do you think i can get a good espresso with these option yes please i would pay to see a pixar movie about a coffee spoon tamper but only if james hoffman wa also a character in the film love the loop daddy t shirt i had a similar delonghi year ago it made fine coffee and eventually broke after a year or so although i have to admit i did not know what i wa doing and probably do not really know what good espresso wa supposed to taste like i would really enjoy that video you mentioned at the end about what it would take to get into the hobby a i have been searching for a good espresso machine grinder for year but have absolutely no idea what to buy in that dollar300 500 price range i subscribed to your channel a while back and looked through your video for something exactly like that but did not find anything edit oops though i wa subscribed am now wow love the idea behind this video would loveeeee to see the can you make good espresso out of machine under gbpx00 series thank you for saving me money i have been thinking about how i want to brew coffee at home but the price of the espresso machine ha stopped me now i know you get what you pay for and save my money for a better one just bend i got a sunbeam em4300 under gbp120 if converted on sale with a 58mm portafilter so i paired it with a vst 15g basket sound crazy hah for grinder i went for a 50mm flat burr stepless have a guess i would say the vst basket really made a huge difference if i use the brand is own non pressurised basket i either get dripping or fast pouring a good basket can really make the most out of your machine a long a you have a capable grinder it is funny i got an instant coffee commercial before the video started dejabrew got my like i had to replay it for my girlfriend to groan at dejabrew earned the like for me cue the initial d music tiny tamper come on now it may of been true in the past that you needed well over 100 pound for a good espresso machine these day that weight is ludicrous imo bare minimum is breville sage be great to get your opinion on the gaggia classic and the sage barista express a an entry level espresso machine i have a krups xp40 it come with pressurised portafilter it self tamp and delivers a dry puck at the end i like what i get out of it better from what i would get from a super automatic i have been using it daily for a couple of year now delonghi is the best i have same but now i upgrade to rancilio silvia really i enjoy the time when i use delonghi amazing video thanks this is so useful james i had no idea there would be such a difference all i want after an exhausting day at work is to brew myself good cup of coffee and watch james hoffman reviewing some crappy stuff i loved that deja brew scene haha looking forward to the follow up video of minimum espresso machine to make good espresso and make it a hobby my vote would be the gaggia classic pro not sure if it is called pro in the uk the breville sage cheaper model i am sure make good espresso and would be a good choice a well but i think the gaggia seems more durable also to add another layer to the hobby aspect you can modify or replace the stock opv spring to adjust the brew pressure add a pid and if something go wrong they are quite self serviceable if you do review the gaggia classic i would recommend checking this guy out he is from the uk and ha been working on and helping people with gaggia classic in forum for a long time from what i gathered i recently installed his opv spring mod kit 9 bar spring to start and i plan to get the pid kit in the future auber also make pid for gaggia classic but they are more expensive he just very recently launched this website he also made this youtube video showing how to change the spring should mention some people get a pressure gauge and cut a little bit off their spring until the desired pressure but then it is not reversible do you think you would find more happiness from a moka pot if you had the money for a new olympia cremina would you get that or a similarly price dual boiler machine and which dual boiler would you get i see that shirt and i like so following the instant video and the cheap pressurised portafilter comment the next video need to be on pre ground supermarket coffee looking forward to the video for recommended espresso machine for home use wa looking at the breville line but am eager to hear your thought james great vid i have the okay delonghi espresso machine for 6yrs i agree it is okay and it noisy but can not tell difference with the taste from starbucks i will wait for your next review of the dollar500 range or so i bought a le than gbp40 made in china brand in hope i would have some better coffee experience a a beginner like you mentioned impulse buying i probably only used it le than 20 time before accepting the fact i had been stupid 9 14 by a longhi way thank you james you just saved this poor old man some dollar please keep the review coming until i can find a decent and affordable for my budget espresso machine i will just keep filter brewing with my 3 minute bunn i have a machine like these excavated from my parent garage they are best thought of a electric moka pot machine basically if you want something espresso ish to make latte and whatnot they can make strong enough black coffee to do that but just get a moka pot instead got a used delonghi kind of espresso maker similar maybe an older model to the one shown in the video to just see for myself if i really want to pull espresso shot at home or rather enjoy the phantasy about making and enjoying espresso i kind of like the espresso i get it wa a little work here and there but the way i see it is that i will improve my machine the moment i get bored with the current one and sell this one a a beginner machine a i have bought myself for 20 euro for me it wa not the great taste i wa into at first but rather whether i will do it at all spending 100 on a single machine before knowing is for me personally a big chunk of money of which you can not know you are up for it my other choice would have been gaggia classic and delonghi dedica ec 685 opinion on the gaggia were that it doe not hold to it quality of the way it wa built in the past so i backed off on this with the dedica i always said to myself to buy it but then again i had to pay around 150 to 200 at once this is not the only issue the you need a good grinder i have the very first hario hand mill back before it got more expensive bought it around 2013 i considered buying the baratza encore a everyone say it is good enough for a start but then again you need to lay down 80 euro or so then there is the tamper or should i rather buy the jack espresso leveler recommended from whole latte love you see there are too many option or upgrade to consider to drink espresso properly that i kind of shyd away before spending 100 in gadget in a student is home i rather go to my closest fancy cafe i where someone can sophisticatedly tell me why my espresso is good or should i say good enough for 1 5 euro a problem even with the better machine is that almost no one is willing to learn and adhere to the required detail detail that are now second nature to mr hoffman otoh if a person is willing to commit to mastering all the seemingly nit picky detail you can achieve far better result than most any coffee shop and when one considers the long term cost saving from home brew the equipment can be affordable a well in the end the biggest down side is all the stuff you need to have sitting around thermometer scale tamper cup grinder espresso machine etc added a like strictly for the wouldeja brew comment make this video gbp100 pound for bad coffee i am better off getting a pestle amp mortar thermometer kettle and a pair of silk stocking to make espresso it can not taste worse than the machine here and i would still have change left to go buy a decent cuppa p s i enjoyed this review looking foward to your next video deja brew lolz exactly the video we need when were looking to start doing espresso a a hobby thanks for making these video james i have trouble making single cup v60 coffee 12grams of coffee anyone ha tip i have a comandante c40 v60 01 i am definitely awaiting your video to see what you deem is the minimum to spend on for a good machine i am not looking to break the bank but i do love espresso and want to get started with it at home have you considered making that a dual part video to add on the same idea for a grinder to pair it with maybe this ha already been looked into is there a major difference in a good quality ground coffee or one in nespresso cup or pad or whatever popular is out there if it is already been reviewed plz reply with a link also i work in a second hand store what should look for when i see a seemingly good machine i had krups and i hated in from day 1 yeah it is pretty difficult to justify getting a cheap espresso machine that make horrible coffee when pour over make great coffee for under 10 buck what is the grinder just got the exact swan machine rebranded a anko in kmart australia last week for dollar80 coming from the hoff fine but a bit dull is good for me planning to get a compatible non pressurized basket soon to see if the taste improves favorite part thanks jeff james thanks for your expertise i would love to start making espresso i would really love to see a video around the idea of starting the hobby full setup for a reasonable a price a possible your review leave nothing to be desired if they are meant to be used with coarsely ground coffee why not test them that way otherwise great video now do under 200 300 love these style of video btw i get that you are comparing machine a they come out of the box but if the winner wa so because it did not have a pressurised basket could not you have tried regular basket in them all they are relatively cheap upgrade and if you can not afford more than gbp100 for a machine might improve the outcome love the video just saying love the t shirt james man i wish you wouldve tried the mr coffee expresso machine i used it for a while and it ended up in storage for along time now it in my trunk trying to get rid of it my friend have that delonghi machine and yeah it just okay but james what your opinion could you say manual espresso maker like rokpresso or flair is better i have over the year purchased several machine that were ether espresso only or had a steamer attached they also could be used to just make regular coffee both my wife amp i like the occasional espresso cappuccino they were so memorable i can not recall the name i doubt i spent more than two hundred dollar for any of them amp none of them are still in my kitchen enough said on that i would like to get a decent machine that not only make espresso but could make a decent cubano a well so i am waiting to see what machine you finally recommend i want to know doe jeff bezos have one of those machine how would these work with a regular portafilter i have a pretty cheap machine at home and i have been thinking about getting an unpressurized filter for it but i am not sure if it will even help i wa gifted a dollar25 espresso machine pretty horrific result what i want to know is how james is not just vibin and jittery after all this coffee loving that marc rebillet shirt please try this can you make a balanced coffee by mixing over extracted and under extracted v60 james maybe you can have another video of those so called pro sumer chinese machine test i had one gemilai crm 3605 that work wonder my first impression of the thumbnail wa that the coffee machine were a bunch of polaroid but i am only mildly disappointed james saved me a few hundred dollar when during one of past video he said if you do not want a new hobby of making small cup of coffee latte art and frothing milk do not buy an espresso machine i really really appreciate that you have done this video thank you sir machine in the low end segment are designed in such a way to make it easy for the layman to get something they perceive a good coffee it ha crema so therefor it should be good and good milk there is bubble i there so it must be good the irony is that if you actually know how to pull shot and foam milk these machine are a nightmare a they prevent you from using your skill i used to be very happy with my baby dose gaggia after i replaced the steamwand with a pointed tip it lasted around 7 year after that i got the carezza which wa actually pretty expensive in it is regular retail price and just garbage because of the pressurised portafilter in my experience the biggest problem are pressurised portafilters and the sad thing is that these are now present on a lot of machine below the 350 price tag even the more expensive gaggia machine are now destroyed by philip saeco because they use the pressurised portafilters however most of those machine are pretty ok machine if you are able to get a regular or naked portafilter holder for them ebay ha some so in general a long a the group head distributes water evenly and the filter is not pressurised it should be no problem to get good espresso out of them given that you know how to make a good shot in the first place one thing not touched up on in this video is the steamwand to be honest most of them are just crap the steam is often not consistent and they are a nightmare to use in the first place the standard tip are garbage and all of them are too short and do not have enough movement to hold a pitcher underneath yourself and move it around thanks james almost bought one of these atrocious machine a year ago i bought the hamilton beach espresso machine dear lord it wa the most terrible coffee related experience i have had so far it did not pull good shot a you might guess but it also started leaking boiling water from the bottom which not just lowered the steam pressure but also damaged my table is surface making it dangerous to unplug the machine i asked for a refund immediatly pfft i can get a decent espresso for le than a fiver i can with a 90cents but flying to rome is a bit more if you are buying a cheap machine buy a used machine i got my silvia for 200 usd on craigslist still sticking with my dollar30 aeropress until i can afford that infernal dollar3500 swiss machine you tormented me with awhile back just buy an aeropress a hand grinder and give up on espresso if you have only got gbp100 to spend replace the aeropress with a v60 and we are talking somedude 160 ish euro i got the signature for 180 what doe the flair manual machine cost in europe uk i love mine it make fantastic espresso though a bit inconsistent but it definitely fall into the hobby category because it allows you to play around so much with different aspect would be very interested to find out how the delonghi dedica ec685m fare in this test got mine two month ago and love it but i have to look into the other portafilter basket option also i need a nice tamper i have this too and bought an aftermarket bottomless filter for it how much do you dose it in general 14 15g me too i have one and i am very satisfied with it it is pretty durable and easy to use i bought a mr coffee one for around dollar120 usd i think same a a lot the other one it good but not good enough that i would prefer to drink straight espresso from it regularly but when making in the milk drink i have been pretty satisfied the other thing that wa important in trying to buy cheap machine wa trying to find something that if i took care of decently it could last and knock on wood it held up pretty well past 1 5 year now looking forward to the video u mentioned looking forward to the follow up here can you rate other coffee chain espresso when they finally open of course a few year ago i bought a cheap espresso machine from argo i forget the make amp model it wa about gbp60ish for two week i played around with everything to try and get a decent cup before giving up and taking it back for a refund if like me you are on a tight budget buy an aeropress and a fellow prismo is it true espresso no but you can control every aspect of the process until you get a shot that you are happy with i use this setup every day and i am more than happy with my morning flat white incredibly informative a always james thank you wish i could muster up the cash for the decent grinder also huge prop for the marc rebillet tee that guy is fantastic i got a used elektra semiautomatica hx for dollar400aud le than gbp200 yes i got super lucky and had first dibs at the listing moral of the story buy a used well built machine over one made in china if you can not afford a new proper machine there are used vibiemme is isomac etc for the equivalent of le than gbp500 every now and then on the market buy something that will last you year if not decade over these chinese mass produced crap could you use a filter from another machine to make a machine a non pressure porterfilter maybe make a video with a 500 pound budget how to allocate it between grinder and machine 50 pound grinder amp 450 pound machine 120 pound grinder amp 380 pound machine and 200 pound grinder and 300 pound machine or something like that like how to get the best espresso for 500 pound i have a vonchef version which wa gbp65 it ha similar feature to the one you tested a pressurised filter with some fiddling and careful grinding i can get some reasonable shot from it but it is quite variable and certain coffee do not work well with it darker roast seem to work better it ok and i am glad i bought it it ha got me well into coffee and when it break i will be happy to spend more on a better unit i wa not prepared to spend that higher price tag up front a i wa not sure i would stick with it or enjoy it a much a i have for me my cheap machine wa a gateway drug and ha got me prepared to spend more in future loop daddy thanks jeff i would love a good minimum machine i have an old seaco aroma which is okay for the odd shot i pull but i would love a much better machine without breaking the bank flair just introduced their neo model which is slightly pared down doe not come with a case or stainless tamper and come with a pressurized portafilter i paid dollar95 usd in the kickstarter plus a little extra to get an additional non pressurized portafilter that i can use once i have a better grinder i have not received mine or tried using a flair yet but i am looking forward to it i am hoping it is the right combination of price and value for someone like me who is just getting started making espresso why am i here i do not even like coffee i had the krups and it wa awful the coffee wa mediocre the steamer broke after two month of regular use and the thing just died right after the warranty expired have fast become a massive fan of your video great knowledge and very funny looking forward to the more expensive machine video have just upgraded our grinder and ha made a difference to a cheap machine delonghi motivo next step is a new machine but need to save up again thanks for making excellent video i do not hate you or me creased me like the colour change at 8 56 he would have a heart attack knowing i am drinking instant coffee while watching this same i hope you dialled it in d great video i have an older version of de longhi machine still same crap with a few design change i have stopped using it after a few week is not ergonomic time consuming to much mess for a cup of coffee overall a big hassle thanks mate nice review of the bottom of the market it would be very interesting to hear your opinion on the best price v value point in the espresso machine market for those of u on a fixed and somewhat limited income keep up the good work could you make a video about how much money you have to spend to get a machine that make decent espresso thank you for doing this series please do the next level up i have the capresso ec pro and it suit me well for now a a learner kit but if you do not like it i am curious what would be something else that would be a better buy or good upgrade way back when we got our machine i looked at cheap option but decided to really stretch our budget and find a well looked after gaggia classic we still have it still use it daily and am very pleased with the coffee i can get from it recently tried a few upgrade in lieu of a more expensive machine and actually took some step backwards i think but i think a second hand classic of the right vintage is a hard to beat cheap ish machine i can not help but think if a dispersion shower screen will fix the center channeling issue seen on the last few machine i have tried the delongi and a mr coffee espresso machine the coffee from both clearly tasted like plastic extremely uncomfortable to watch a a coffee professional xd looking forward to a possible follow up it would be great to know some good option for home use or even an informational video talking about what to look for in a machine for those of u who want gs3 is but can not drop 10g another great video james well done james i own a breville sage dual boiler machine im finding it extremely hard to pull any resemblance of a good shot from the machine consistently ive tried dialing in grind size and played around with brew time but somehow my shot are never any good i also use freshly roasted bean my grinder is the breville smart grinder pro im finding myself using the machine a a result le and le im out of idea can you suggest anything i can do to yield a better more consistant result with the mental water jet you could try a paper filter on top of your puck to prevent it from creating such a mental channel seeing that built in tamper made me go yikes out loud what about a grade higher like the smeg for around gbp300 i have the de longhi dedica deluxe it is ok but not great it doe give me my fix until i can spend some money on a better machine i can always fall back on my trusty bialetti though great video im starting in the espresso world and im getting a delonghi im not sure if it come with the non presurissed portsfilter i hope everything go well love your channel too greeting from per we have amazing coffee here you should try it all of those are running higher pressure than 9bar thats also part of the problem with high quality grinding le fine imo it better to go even below 9bar till like 6bar james i bought a de longhi dedica 680m second hand about a year a half back had to buy a normal basket for it but i can dose up to 18g and modded the panarello and replaced it with a rancillio steam wand i am a happy camper for what i paid i have the delonghi machine and the reason i think the basket is always falling down is that in older version it is almost impossible to take it off so they went to one extreme hard to take off to the other falling off by itself i spent gbp40 on an espresso machine a second hand recently serviced gaggia classic on facebook market going strong for 3 year so far possibly the best bargain i have ever had i bought a secondhand saeco poemia which wa probably about 200 250 usd new for about 60 usd and have been brewing perfectly acceptable shot grinding primarily with a hario hand grinder i wa just about to buy me a machine but now i have a better idea what to look for i got very lucky a a student found a broken gaggia classic which just needed a descale for 80 quid that machine served me well for about 5 year a far a i can tell in this price range if you want something that resembles espresso for under dollar100 an aeropress plus that prismo pressurized attachment is going taste better and be more consistent than any of those it will not be espresso but those do not really produce espresso either great review i wa tempted to buy a budget one but he right on the ball with this review it not worth it wonder if the gaggia classic or the rancilio silva is the minum you need for a decent expresso a an entry level machine silvia simonelli oscar or if lever then pavoni i wa actually thinking on getting either the de longhi you showed or the next price range which is the de longhi icona but now i think i will just wait for the next review and decide from there another good video given your extensive experience is machine to look out for and to avoid when buying second hand hi james got a couple question for you 1 i love milk based espresso drink like latte cappuccino and mocha and i have been trying to find a cheap home solution to make them i have heard that moka pot come pretty close to traditional espresso and so i wa wondering would you recommend just buying a moka pot or spending a little more money and getting a cheap espresso machine like the delonghi in this video 2 i wa wondering how much the flavour of coffee differs when the coffee is freshly ground instead of pre ground i do not think i would want to spend a lot of money on a grinder so would you recommend buying a cheap hand grinder like the one from your ikea video or would you say that cheap grinder are not much better than pre ground coffee very informative and fun video btw difficult to ignore the second hand market picked up a rancilio silvia for under gbp200 and doe the job for me so many gaggia classic out there a well these are much better buy than new cheap machine imo great video now i really appreciate my gaggia baby class i am looking for to your promised future video to recommend a machine that still mades a good espresso at the lowest price point besides that would love a video about 2 3 level of grinder i e the minimum needed for a good espresso with at least 2 higher price point with a description of how much the espresso will actually improve right now i am using my gaggia with the mdf grinder single dosing and weighing my dose looking to upgrade to the next price point that will really make a difference in taste the niche look nice but is there anything cheaper that could really upgrade the shot i am pulling i would also consider a manual grinder if there is a very large price difference to an electric grinder keep up the great work and video i love the detail and accuracy shoutout loopdaddy marc i am pretty sure the flair is the cheapest you can get that will actually make good espresso so how much more do we need to spend there should be a balance between cost and function delongi is a great coffee machine i have the delonghi model i got it for christmas last year got a coffee syphon this year and i think it is great industrial espresso machine are extremely expensive so in reality no cheaper machine is going to match up i have looked at machine in store that cost over 1000 euro but they still seem to have the same component a the cheaper model i have had coffee in cafe that have been awful even though the barista is using an industrial machine meaning it take both a good machine and good barista skill you can still make great coffee with the delonghi at home and then treat yourself to amazing coffee at the weekend at your favourite coffee shop would you like to give the delonghi to me i am from indonesia thank you james a really good and useful video did you try the other bad machine with pressured portafilters with the grind of coffee they would prefer used such a pre ground from a supermarket i just wonder in that case would they have produced something more drinkable i will look forward to next set of video in this series and until then keep saving thanks again sir but you did say it i knew it you hate u p freud would have a field day with you reaction to plastic spoon tamper james thank you for your insight the conclusion is spot on please make the same video but with 100 250dollar range do you think that it would be better to buy a nespresso coffee pod type machine for the money good question for what money can you get an ok machine how many cup of good coffee could you buy for gbp60 99 99 if you are looking cheap espresso machine i recommend briel e 14 and 53mm double basket there is pressurized filter but you can remove it it give you better looking espresso than any of those machine on video james getting desappointed is my spirit animal love the t shirt love marc rebillet yes finally been wondering about your take on this the flair is the best choice for cheap espresso maker at home but you have to love tinkering and playing a a hobby you can pull outstanding shot once you understand the flair this wa a fun video i have an old krups xp 4000 i have just ordered a non pressurized basket for it just to see what happens i am excited for your future video about the bare minimum machine i have been looking for an at home espresso machine that will replace my moka pot my budget is tight so i have been hesitant to spend more than dollar500 on a good machine but i do not want to waste my money on a dollar60 amazon basic an interesting follow up video would be looking at the preowned market delonghi ec685 dedica i used to own a saeco poemia with a cheap grinder i modded the machine so the portafilter wa not pressurised anymore but it wa not worth the effort in the lifetime of this machine 2 year i pulled exactly one shot of espresso which wa lovely the rest sour bitter and disgusting and the crema before the modding wa more like concrete than a crema i switched back to caf crema out of a fully automated machine after this failure which is by far the better invest than a cheap espresso machine because the espresso out of these thing taste equally disgusting that home espresso hobbyist video circa 300 pound video would be greatly welcomed i think i have made a similar comment in the past but you look like a busy man so i forgive you joke aside keep up the awesome work i have got the delonghi which i grabbed from my parent i am very inexperienced but i certainly agree that it shake a lot our cup even move around while it is pouring and the tamper is very awkward to use what is your opinion on the fully automatic bean to cup phillips saeco espresso machine i think that the best option for the lowest price is the manual flair espresso machine hi james really interesting video but for me even 100 pound is still too expensive at the moment however i love my little moka pot and i wa wondering if you could a more in depth video regarding the use of this device the main thing i am wondering about is how changing the heat of your stove will affect the brewing proces perhaps changing the amount of water in the bottom compartment will have huge effect on the final result de longhi icona pump espresso machine is great yes it is pressurized but i do like the coffee it give and for a around a gbp120 machine that i got year ago and never had a problem with i think it is a good investment if you want a parisian cafe espresso level you will have to pay for a good machine otherwise you will have to accept a not bad espresso if you want a budget and buy inexpensive machine can you make comparison video for automatic espresso machine v manual espresso machine ex flair rokpresso in the same range price which will worth it to buy for make espresso at home ascaso basic is probably the minimum acceptable electric machine or a breville sage i have got one of the italian 250ml brass boiler machine that used to be bottom end but those have not been cheap for a very long time that is odd had a similar krups did not channel a bad a that it wa closer to the delonghi got a good solid puck sold it anyway once i learned more about proper espresso and concluded i did not want to upgrade and force myself into a very expensive hobby looking at one of those manual espresso maker like robot flair in the future for now i switched to collecting drippers and making pourovers daily i know completely different type of coffee but would you say buying a moka pot for much le be a better buy than these until you get a proper machine surely the sage barista express is the best under gbp500 saved up for mine and soo worth it thanks for another great video out of curiosity how do those cheap espresso machine compare to say a nespresso capsule machine i have a nespresso machine and a a neanderthal who just need a string dose of caffeine i have been happy enough with it for a couple of year but having tasted superb espresso while in italy and in my local independent coffee shop i am starting to believe i am missing out which of course i am my nephew who is a full on coffee head expert ha told me that unless i spend serious money on the machine grinder and decent bean i might a well stay with the nespresso what do you guy think is there an affordable way for a skint person to get decent espresso at home would love to see your review on some budget grinder including blade one i know you did an episode on flair would that be the basic setup would the bare minimum be a flair a niche and a good water boiler i do not think i have ever heard something positive coming out of his mouth if you want the contrast of hearing james enjoying a thing consider the previous espresso machine he reviewed the lovely though incredibly expensive olympia cremina perhaps you are more intrested of these crap test than nice one but perhaps you are right he should learn to lie u please review the rancilio silvia it is pretty popular here with a decent price can we have the bare minimum machine a your next video please james james this wa a great review too bad that it is still not possible to have these machine simple and cheap but nevertheless good for you to point that out in answer to your question i would like to know if there is a low budget machine that is acceptable according to you say a 3 5 out of 5 point and what will the price point of such a thing be the price point is what pavoni europiccola cost sure the learning curve is there but you can make 5 5 esppressos i ve bought a cheap delonghi dedica a few year ago and an commandante grinder because i didn t have much money but i cut the portalfilter so it is bottomless and i use a bigger unpressurised basket f r 18g coffee i think it make pretty good espresso for the money having access to a good espresso machine make me miss working in cafe nero the same way having access to janet make me miss the academia hilarious all i want to know what the cheapest one that make good espresso on the roadside i found one of the basic machine branded a a mrcoffee used it for a couple year i just found an ascaso dream by the roadside and it so much better i finally understand real espresso i wa literally saying to a friend the other day i wish you would do a review of low end espresso machine is james hoffmann spying on me nice marc rebillet shirt i really want to know where you got that shirt i bought the capresso espresso ecpro at dollar240 i wanted to see if i wa really interested in making espresso at home i enjoyed it a lot but it did not last long a the quality started to show when the broiler kept losing heat and the espresso did not taste ha good a the first couple of week but now i feel confident dropping dollar600 on an espresso machine without a doubt i had my first espresso at cafe nero once i loved it i would love to hear your opinion on the delonghi dedica especially since there seems to be a quite robust modding on a budget community around it i e you can get an unpressurized basket for it you can change the panarello steam wand with a rancio silvia one i have even heard of people changing the pump on the machine nevertheless it is one of the few programable machine in that price range so your opinion on it would be greatly appreciated from my finding the delonghi dedica and the gaggia classic are the two main competitor for those looking at obtaining some more than okay result and to eventually hone their skill on a budget i have a delonghi poemia at work wich is now sold a saeco philip poemia or gagia viva deluxe and is similar experience a a delonghy in your test except it ha a delonghi patented crema valve in the filter holder make pretty good espresso if you know how to work around it cheapinness at home i use ascaso dream and would love if you have an opportunity to test it out and share your thought good info even though i am still confused trying to figure out espresso for the first time on this rok thanks for that review by the way i am very glad i went manual for the price point i wa in i have been so tempted by his manual espresso review but my grinder is lousy and i doubt it will be a easy to get a good espresso a james make it look what grinder are you using and what is the frustration versus puzzled enjoyment factor of figuring out how to pull shot same here there rok together with the mindset of espresso being a hobby brings me great enjoyment additional point a review of the sette 270 would be fantastic i have high hope interesting video would like to see more video like this with price increment of 100gbp or so i believe the delonghi dedica ec685 would have been a better choice than the delonghi shown in the video until recently i had a dollar100 mr coffee espresso machine i sort of impulse bought it because it wa on sale for dollar60 but i actually did use it a lot for 1 2 year i am the sort of person who is loathe to spend dollardollar at a coffee shop when i can make a cup for a fraction of the cost at home so i am not sure how well it stack up against good espresso but the coffee i got from it wa meh it wa better for milk drink which is what i usually made i did not know what a pressurized portafilter wa until watching this but i think that explains how i broke my machine i actually ground fresh coffee relatively fine and the last time i used the machine the pump just wa not able to force the water through and went kaput oh well for dollar60 i think i at least got my money is worth out of it that swann espresso machine ha so many of the same component a the lidl silvercrest espresso machine the dial is the same the portafilter is the same the tamper is the same the steamer is the same the number of control is the same the light are the same the main difference is that the lidl espresso machine cost me gbp39 99 at gbp90 it appears to be a rip off i am happy with the coffee produced by the lidl espresso machine for use in long drink i still favour my aeropress though it is just easier better off just buying a 30 quid moka pot lead u james this little dial is cheap and awful i would love a review of best grinder under gbp100 i have got that delonghi ec155 and felt a bit deja brew here hehe salam kopi i always love your espresso machine review i wasted a tonne of money on the francisfrancis x1 a few year ago before i understood espresso machine simply because i thought it looked nice after messing around trying to replace the panarello steam wand i decide on a fracino piccino which ha been great for domestic use i thought fracino were an interesting proposition a they are uk based and in my experience have offered great after sale support it is also at an interesting price point below most e61 group machine i would be very interested in your thought on either of these i am amazed the delonghi come with a proper basket the thing with these machine is while it might be possible to get ok good coffee out of them but good luck with cleaning and servicing would be interested to see whatused machine you could find for the same money i have had a lot of friend recommend the breville duo temp a a good starter if you do an under gbp300 video then i would very much like to hear your thought on this machine if you do not like pressurized filter and you somehow end up with cheap coffee machine with pressurized filter only you can help yourself easily make the hole at bottom of the filter bigger that is it that is what i did with delonghi icona before i threw it away because of deep frustration d love the mark rebillet shirt okay so i am gon na buy the de longhi and an ek43 to go with look for a machine made by delta this is the one i am using it been a year now still doing good none of the part warn out yet removable nozzle work well easy to clean ha good pressure it make better coffee than anywhere ive had outdoors apart from real italian machine with decent coffee made by a pro who know what they are doing under 100 pond i did not know there one that heavy that almost 45 kilogram hi james the swan retro look identical to the anko espresso machine sold at kmart in australia that people have been going nut over at dollar89 aud 48 pound it significan notly cheaper over here for some reason it is interesting to hear your comment on the machine considering the praise it ha gotten from some of the review site a an example in a blind taste test by our coffee taste tester who are all professional baristas and industry expert the kmart machine received a score of 70percent on the taste test compared to the delonghi la specialista which cost dollar949 and scored 65percent this sort of commentary seems more of a reflection of how poorly a dollar1000 machine did than how good an dollar89 machine did almost a if they are implying dollar1000 coffee machine normally score around 65percent to promote the cheaper machine having held out on buying a machine to avoid buying cheap rubbish i am looking forward to your bare minimum video great video i would love to see another dialling in episode using the sage breville barista express which i think could be the minimum spend amount to pull good espresso bambino plus sage pro grinder is a little le plus if you upgrade the bambino you still have a good grinder james enough is enough it is time for you to start going deep on tiramisu a i read your comment a commercial on the tv said high blood pressure hmm may be a sign to stay away oh man the one advantage to being home for the pandemic is that my folk have the nice breville barista express and i have got the piddly delonghi the machine itself is also uff a challenge thank you for this review very much looking forward to the next price bracket finally i am so excited to see what machine he decides is the bare minimum to make good espresso hollow empty bitter sour sound like me 2 year ago before i got married i enjoyed this much more than the terrible coffee drink review you suffering here is a lot more usefull i had no idea what wa wrong with pressurized filter except that my brew time were completely off compared to the recommendation i could see online haha the marc rebillet shirt i bought a krups thing over 10 year ago i tried and i tried to make any good espresso with it but it wa impossible when you think you succeeded it still tasted strange many time the water had problem coming through the coffee this think is now in my basement you after watching your video i remember it and i am going go send it to dev null a soon a possible thanks for a great video further to the comment below how about doing a series of review of machine costing under gbp200 then gbp300 etc obviously this would depend if you can get the machine on loan from the various manufacturer i think that would give a fair indication to u out here on where we need to be looking to find a decent machine for a decent price would have been interesting to know the temperature of the water dispersed from the machine however no one that buy any of those machine is not going to have a niche grinder probably using a blade grinder which make the whole thing worse good video though modding then delonghi wa really worth it made a bottomless portafilter with a la pavoni basket what grinder is being used here niche zero can not wait to see that video minimum to get a good espresso home hobby i had a delonghi and did not make it to a year pump failure i bought a delonghi ec155 in undergrad for dollar50 on craigslist i would say that over the course of 4 year of messing around with it fairly regularly i got fewer than 5 shot that were memorably good tasting still wa fun at the time and started me down the road to loving coffee always wondered what would happen if you paired it with a high end grinder thanks james very accurate assessment i inherited one of the older delonghi model and used it daily for about 6 month i wa happy with it till i got my flair pro the night and day from my manual shot to what i could get from that machine wa enough for me to sell the delonghi to a friend and put the money towards a better grinder i think it is great start to a series thanks what about the beko i got mine for 65 quid currently 90 on ao seems to be similar to the delonghi video idea coffee set up at home for different budget covering grinder and espresso machine e g budget of gbp300 gbp600 gbp1000 would be very useful to alot of people i think cheer love the review i guess delonghi dedica ec685 gaggia classic pro breville could be included in your next video thanks james i used de longhi bco2060 in my old office a year ago and it had the same portafilter a the one in the vid it wa plastic y very noisy not sturdy and the tamper wa up there in the ceiling cleaning that thing since it wa unused for almost 3 year wa very painful especially after brewing portafilter and that tamper the coffee tasted okay though at least better than the one in random coffeeshop may be de longhi any series is good enough for cheap espresso machine but i think i prefer saving up for flair i wish this video wa out before i bought a horrible cheap machine lmao please review the morphy richards new europa expresso maker i have a delonghi and i find with a good tamper grinder and with enough time and effort i can make coffee better than 90percent of the coffee shop around me there is also a whole community online dedicated to getting the most out of this little machine which is a plus can you link to it specifically looking for way to reduce pressure from 15 bar to 9 bar fix shower screen jet stream buy used i got a used gaggia classic three way solenoid version for gbp65 spent another gbp40 replacing some of the worn part seal and gasket and it doe pretty well a an espresso machine i think i can not fully compare since i have not used anything more expensive but i have used enough budget machine to know that it performs way better than those i have a de longhi magnifica currently on amazon for gbp250 i got this a a house warming gift approx 5 year ago and use it every day i have tried quite a few setting and have it dialled into what i think taste nice current setting grind 2 5 water 2 3rds on the dial strength 4 5ths on the dial i only ever use the one shot button i would love to hear from anyone else that ha this machine to get some pointer 1 what do you think are the are the best espresso setting for this machine 2 at the current price point am i being best served with this make and model regard new fan to this channel i do not have any of the one you tested however would love to see a smeg coffee machine review on both of the machine they have only because i have them and want to know how much of a waste of money it actually wa and i just purchased a swan retro last week for my new house wish i had waited a week to watch this ha i have had ok result more impressed through my aeropress mind for good entry machine i would recommend checking out lelit and quickmill 300 350gbp i think hi james i wa gifted the andrew james a a birthday present it always made disappointing coffee espresso or milk drink and yes it is now at the back of the cupboard never to be seen again i love your idea on what is a minimum spend to get good espresso at home thanks for your great video the marc rebillet shirt earned a like immediately 100 pound my local cafe serf the best italian espresso for 6gbp and i think this is well overpriced just kidding great video a always when the espresso is not even worth stirring hey james i would love to see some sort of video about the modded budget coffee scene there are a ton of people that retrofit non pressurized portafilters to cheap espresso machine learn how to manipulate the temperature of the boiler by refilling it with cool water modify their hario grinder to be stepless attach those modified hario grinder to drill etc there is literally an entire website where you can download 3d print file for mod to your hario mini mill budget diy home espresso really is a scene and a ton people put in a ton of diy effort for some pretty impressive result unfortunately there doe not seem to be much overlap with the larger coffee scene on youtube i have actually seen your name mentioned on several forum post and i know for a fact that there are a ton of diy coffee nerd me included that watch your channel and would love to see you hook a drill up to a modded hario and dial in some shot on an ec 155 with a dollar10 non pressurized non branded portafilter it would get view search youtube for ec155 bottomless portafilter or hario mod to see what i mean i would be happy to send you some of the better post and resource out there if you are interested here is an example look like he is in the exact same scenario a your new video expensive ish grinder cheap delonghi he just upgraded the portafilter sawed the bottom off the handle so he could see the basket and took time to dial everything in a lot of people do this i bet you thought i wa going to say would j brew but i did not cause i do not hate you or me i laughed a little too much i literally lol would ooh im so excited for your aminimum investment required recommendation not going to buy anything until i have your sign off had a chance to look at the flair neo yet thank you james for your thought on those cheap espresso machine i will save some money and get a much better machine probably for dollar1800 or more on next couple of month but what abouts nespresso thanks for this james even more thanks for letting u know you will be exploring home espresso further i am excited to see the end result i have been pulling decent shot off the flair which is around the same price range and it offer way more pressure control than these machine you look like you pronounce ibiza with a th it will be interesting when you start exploring other machine the one beginner setup the espresso subreddit recommends is a gaggia classic and eureka mignon specialita okay now we need the best budget electric grinder under gbp250ish i have a sage duo temp pro and a dose control pro grinder combination come in at just under gbp500 i think and it make pretty good espresso better or equivalent to most decent cafe the steam arm on it also let you make latte art and texture milk for latte which is a big hobby in itself when you start learning probably the best combination of grinder and machine at tat price point a a general rule these clickety clackety espresso machine video are my favourite i have got the krups i thought i wa not using it right a i kept getting the channeling effect no matter what grind setting i used i wa really hoping it would come out better perhaps if i used an aero press filter on the top to stop the disbersement issue i just went to amazon u and the same amazon basic is special priced at dollar55 54 gbp43 41 i am thinking they heard you and want to be rid of it woooaaa i wa dreaming about exactly this topic it wonderful always appreciate your video would have been fun to see how they tested if you would use a non pressurised portafilter i have a small delonghi ec680 and then i bought non pressurised filter and the result became much better i have the delonghi bco421 where it make both espresso and filtered coffee it is acceptable for my taste but i prefer the filtered coffee that come out of it i had the de longhi when i wa 15 and really into milk drink i wanted to make flat white and cappucinos etc it served that purpose well although at that age great espresso to me meant lot of crema because that is what i thought it wa and i had a terrible grinder looking back i would have preferred to save up a bit more and consider my option but hindsight is a wonderful thing welp i got a starbucks double espresso for gbp98 5 at heathrow last week and out wa not half bad so yeah you can chinese brand wpm welhome gemilai not comment much now coz im still waiting for mine in shipping i would be curious what you think about the all in one coffee machine i own the philip saeco intelia focus hd8751 47 which i bought second hand and though it doe not make an espresso a good a a dedicated espresso machine with my own home roasted coffee bean it get the job done perhaps in the future i might get a good espresso machine great review at least it educates me what to avoid i have always wanted an espresso machine luckily i have been smart enough not to buy one of these thanks james i can not wait to see the next iteration of these review when your scale cost 3x more than your espresso machine i like this video though i initially wrote what seemed a witty comment in the tl dw format i realized there is truly no such thing a too long of a video from james p s sub gbp100 machine are the cause of global warming hacking a budget machine to use non pressurized basket improved the coffee a lot gauge temperature can make the coffee making process more complicated which is not beginner friendly for my first coffee year let me press a button and get an ok coffee at home i am really curious what you can do with these machine if you were to take the time to tweak them under the hood by overriding the controller to well give you more control but then again i do not want to take the risk of blowing something up electrocution or burning something loopdaddy fan a well tipped some bat using brave browser highly recommend for creator or to earn money while browsing would you test the philip lattego automatic coffee machine love love love your video and my appreciation of coffee ha evolved since i began watching them for which i thank you i would love ot if you would do a video about turkish coffee your take on it and if you like it or not thanks this is really useful can you do something similar for different price range so people know what is best to buy with different budget the best shot i have had from a delonghi ec 155 us pressurized basket wa because i discovered ristrettos with my own experimenting before knowing what they were i wa not using a scale then i wa using volumetric parameter i would guess around 13 g in and 1 fl oz out had some cheap light roasted bean amazon branded bean ground then very fine on a dollar10 hand grinder tasted like sweet raisin or in the uk a james mentioned before currant i am here for the deja brew lt 3 keep it up james i think you made a great test of each one and got the best espresso coffee you could the problem is your high quality expectation this machine are for starbucks client that drink fluffy white gigantic cappuccino and latte with a hit of black dark roasted coffee extract they call espresso and 2 pack of sugar it wa great fun watching you get frustrated hey james if you are interested in going even cheaper the mr coffee ecm160 go for around dollar30us in store that is only around 25 quid in my experience with a bit of practice with the machine it make better espresso than a mastrena but you are virtually required to pull 4 shot at a time to get a good brew out of it in my experience the video my poor as needed but did not know it i bought an aeropress 5 year ago i am now on my second i use a burr grinder i would love to upgrade to an espresso machine but i know they are expensive i would really appreciate a video on the minimal amount you can spend on a machine thank you very much for this video james hey james how about a how to brew using a pour over drip stand or coffee stand or whatever it is called haha i have been searching for a video on it and can not really find any decent one i am curious to know what you think about arabic turkish coffee it is really popular over here and the result can rally vary on the spectrum of excellent horrible do you think it is a good brewing method 2 27 deeply unpleasant to use seems like james is finally starting to make video for the audience he ha instead of the audience he wish he had i wanted to buy a cheap espresso machine and i got a gaggia ri8423 21 gran style witch made me pleased with the coffee it make is there any experience in comparison to that i actually have the australian build of the swan i have had it for a couple of year and look i am no coffee expert but i think it taste ok i very much view it a my introductory foray into espresso and one day i intend to upgrade to something better the real thing i found to be utterly terrible about this unit wa the stupid straw on the steam wand i took mine off and can produce pretty ok foam but the wand is also frustratingly short i do not regret the purchase it definitely ha not been lost in a cupboard i am rather happy with it that said your video ha me excited about what my future upgrade ha in store for me me watch james hoffman video also me drink lidl brand coffee from a krups nespresso machine i do james v60 method daily and occasionally his french press method a well but when i need folgers in a mr coffee i can still enjoy it learning the depth of coffee help me appreciate it more when it is great but doe not diminish my ability to enjoy supermarket coffee a long a it is not actually terrible ik do it even cheaper i have the earopress and chemex i watch every new video but drink pre ground coffee from a french press measured by eye without any timing coffeeconfessions if you enjoy coffee then you should be welcomed here without judgement calvin rey i do it is kind off weird coffee like it is somehow inconsistent in taste sometimes it is really sour and sometimes it even taste a little burnt but most of the time it is pretty decent hey james i think you missed a point by not saying if you would rather use the delonghi or something even cheaper and mechanical for espresso making like a roc or a flair or even a simple mokka pot how would these rank against the delonghi would be nice if you could clear that up a moka pot doe not produce espresso flair classic would really like to see this in the sub 250 300 range especially comparing something like these machine v some of the hand pulled device you have shown i have the breville be 250 around dollar200 aud not worth dollar2 lot of steam everywhere you can not pull a decent shot i put it in my garage and purchased a delonge nespresso machine it producer more enjoyable coffee a very good video love every minute of it cool video you could try the breville bambino plus if the answer wa yes the title would probably have been you can get good espresso for under gbp100 11 one11 i actually used an older version of that delonghi at my office and it wa not awful a an experience sure it feel cheap and lightweight and it would be better to purchase another tamper even a 15euros one but the one i used had a stable portafilter basket it wa possible to swap between two basket size one and two cup and it is possible to find it at a lower price if you are lucky overall i would save my money for something better but i wa not too disappointed 8 56 what happened with the jump in exposure shame about the outcome of this experiment what price bracket is next under gbp200 what about de longhi dedica ec685 it would be great to see your thought on some of the market leader around the mid level price range i have a version of the swan espresso machine mine is the ikohs it wa gbp70 and for me a start to try making my own cappucino or attempt of i still struggle with it after using it everyday for just over a month now for me it is better than instant coffee and cheaper than going out and getting coffee but i would love more info on how to get more out of it if that is even a possibility keen to see where future test end up i have got a second hand gaggia classic and it wa not really a good enough experience to convert me from my filter brewing please say deja brew next time i bought the delonghi in the exact scenario you imagined late night impulse buy used it several time and now it just take up counter space i am fine with my pour over setup and the occasional espresso at a cafe now great public service announcement yes test the bialetti brikka is like the mini moka pot but for espresso hi james i have bought a similar machine and it is inconsistent and messy did not use it for a long time and just visit the local cafe for a good coffee still on a search of good and affordable daily espresso machine honestly i am glad you are giving me ammunition against those kind of atrocity exactly the title of your video came up and i am very looking forward to a video where my taste bud will not get hurt and i do not have to sell my car and walk 40 mile to work just to be able to afford a la marzocco or something cheer man your opinion is so valued the german roasting champion recommended your channel i wonder why he did not include the mr coffee ecmp50 a similarly priced machine that i used for year before upgrading to a barista express this is why i donate to the patreon to watch james make shitty espresso so i do not have to next up would love to see james compare gaggia classic breville infuser and other medium tier machine i would double my pledge to see that i have the swan retro which in australia is some generic brand sold by kmart in black i wanted something better than instant and cheaper than capsule i only like milky coffee i use supermarket pre ground stuff it is fine i have had it for over 2 year and it continues to be fine i wa not looking for a hobby i work from home and only drink 2 cup per day sometimes i have client visit and i offer them a coffee nobody ha complained repeat visitor have repeat coffee and all say nice coffee it is a you say fine but a bit dull which work for me what about the flare manual espresso machine deja brew d can you make a review of used espresso machine for under 150euros i suppose that is something like 130gbp or if it is easier for you used machine for under 100gbp hey bozo what s the conversion from pound to dollar american audience u know u into game i am planning some bike packing trip camping touring with a push bike can you recommend a portable simple and lightweight set up for good camping coffee enter stage left lidl with a machine for gbp50 it is not the espresso machine that i need but the frother i am tired using french press for frothing xd i have a machine similar to the swanretro but somehow even cheaper it ha the exact same portafilter i understand i am not going to be able to pull great espresso but it is a great gateway drug into the hobby and i have learned so much trying to dial it in i never thought to remove the extra filter so guess there is new fun to be had now fine espresso is better than no espresso been fighting the urge to buy a cheap machine all this quarantine thank you so much for this video now i can confidently wait to hear your bare minimum recommendation much love from tokyo i believe there is a big community that mod and improves the delonghi machine to bring it to the next level will love to see your take on this i have a delonghi that is about 3 year old and ha the similar water issue to the krupp but it doe pull a pretty half decent shot despite having the cheap style pressurised portafilter once lockdown is over here in the uk and i get back to work i plan to upgrade to a sage barista express a a treat to myself will you be reviewing the fellow ode grinder i have bought a delonghi but sadly it came with only with 3 different pressurized porta filter maybe it is possible to get the correct filter for mine or drill some small hole in the one in do not use definitely looking forward to the next iteration of this been brewing filter for a few year have an entry level grinder wilfa grinder but i always thought espresso wa too intimidating to get into it seems like there is so much to consider it will be nice to have some guidance had a good chuckle with deja brew good oneq doe anything beat a 2nd hand silvia bang for the buck wise i would love to see a review including delonghi scultura james wearing loop daddy is merch let is gooooooooooo soo just get a breville duo temp lol the machine just bend based on experience one can get a reasonable good espresso from a de longhi ec 685 which is however cost around gbp200 though it come with a pressurised basket there are non pressurised basket on the market for le than gbp10 it would be nice to recommend a better home espresso machine for different price tag i use delonghi dedica deluxe and it is good i wish if you can teach u the basic for using home espresso machine and getting the best possible espresso from it thanks for the insight h koenig exp530 thermoblock cecotec power espresso 20 barista pro double thermoblocks 260 270 euro nemox fenice single boiler 259 550 euro i did get a lot of mileage out of that delonghi ec155 actually it is cheap feeling and the tamp and portafilter it come with are trash however i bought a 55mm unpressurized portafilter basket and a stainless steel tamp for literally dollar20 more i eventually also bought a good grinder and a scale and pulled shot after shot to dial it in eventually i wa making great tasting full bodied sweet and delicious espresso point is if you do not buy fresh bean from your local roaster an adequate grinder and a scale to reproduce your result it doe not matter if you bought a dollar100 or dollar1000 espresso machine your shot are going to suck for a while i purchased the swan machine to see if i wanted to get into coffee making it is a difficult machine to get right you can repeat the same process multiple time and get different result i often find espresso come out one side faster than the other one trick i found wa to get rid of the first second of espresso a that is just bitter after that it is okay doe the delonghi non pressurised basket fit in any other machine i wa getting really tired of french press coffee so i got a swan retro it work well when compacting the hell outta 18g into the 2 shot basket about a 2 2 5 yield ratio though it is probably the amazing cloud picker coffee doing all the work i am really happy with the machine id love more review like this different machine at different price point what do we have to spend to get really good espresso at home i personally would love a review of semiautomatic maybe you could do one about buying second hand espresso machine there are lot of gaggia classic on ebay james is the king of descriptor and articulating experience could this video be the pre cursor to a gaggia classic review i hope and doubt in equal measure love this kind of experiment could you make a comparison of affordable espresso machine where you can get good frothy milk for latte art thanks i have a slightly different delonghi with a pressurised portafilter and no it doe not pull amazing shot and yes sometimes i get frustrated when i grind my bean too fine and it can not cope but i love making coffee with it it brings me so much joy it is my first machine and i love it it cost me gbp90 and she will be with me for a long time to come i would also love to see you dive into second hand deal i bet a lot of coffee machine which would be over budget for most people if bought new could be quite interesting second hand you can pick up a second hand rok gc manual lever espresso machine from ebay for under gbp100 it is a perfect machine for a home espresso hobby a lot le to go wrong than with an electric machine it us a standard porta filter it ha a sensible dispersion screen for evenly extracting the puck and you can control every aspect of the brewing process yourself it also ha a basket that will take 18g which is far more useful than the 12g basket that these electric machine come with it is also really easy to maintain all of the part that would ever need servicing are available a a gbp25 kit awesome great review representing marc rebillet i see you james would be interested to see james feeling about the cheaper breville sage machine like the duo temp infuser and barista express the answer is gaggia baby it would be interesting to see what an extra gbp50 00 would get you compared to these i do not know if you can buy this machine where you are but i am a big believer in the sunbeam em7000 current model previously em6910 and a model that can handle pod em7100 i have used these machine for close to 15 year and can get a good tasting coffee but i must admit i would prefer the steam to be a bit more powerful you can buy these machine on special for about dollar600 australian or about dollar420 usd i really like my em6900 though i think there is some reliability issue at least with the em6900 6910 i know the collar is really soft metal and wear out i got mine 2nd hand and it is well overdue for replacement a shape that make me slightly uncomfortable james hoffman 2020 i think we have just found the design for james is next t shirt would manual espresso machine like the flair rok robot make better espresso than all these look like i am getting the delonghi manuel espresso machine like flair or these cheap in your country machine bc they cost more than 200dollar here marc rebillet respect shame you did not consider a manual machine such a the flair or the rok presso a they probably make better espresso than any of these even if you have to add the kettle you chickened out on the pun yet still used it coward i still love the pun though i have had the delonghi for over a year and i am pretty happy with it overall by far the biggest factor in the quality of the output is the quality of the grind i buy my coffee pre ground and did have sourcing issue at the begining of lockdown which meant that i transitioned to using an esspresso ground coffee from a supermarket which wa a poor experience the tamper a you pointed out is not ergonomic in the slightest i have a seperate tamper for this reason the issue with the porta filter are also a bit frustrating i leave the puck to cool enough to handle before putting the ground in the bin and rinse the porta filter under the tap after use i find this address the usability issue when brewing once i have to do something else when i have guest having coffee which is where the drawback are exacerbated i resort to washing the puck out after pulling the shot which is not something i really like doing nice marc rebellet quarantine your shirt finding the best acceptable espresso machine is a great idea i have been using the delonghi ec685 m and it ha been quite good value imo it is in the gbp200 range great video please do a mid range espresso machine 250 500 pound i like the idea of entry level equipment amazon basic aka shiny landfill i have got one of the slightly more pricey delonghi machine a dedica deluxe they have got a bit of a funny shape going on that i got fairly cheaply off ebay it came with a pressurised portafilter but with an after market non pressurised basket it make pretty decent espresso imo however it is still nowhere near the coffee shop quality i crave interested in the better option for more than 100gbp the delonghi must be updated because i had that exact model but it had a pressurised portafilter basket similar to the swan like you say it wa ok but not great i recently bought a breville machine but wa disappointed to find out that it is breville uk not breville australia known a sage in eu due to the first breville already being established in the uk it is ok but again came with a pressurised portafilter basket however it is a standard 58mm size so i wa able to order an unpressurised basket so i have been playing with different coffee and getting much better result i only have a hand grinder porlex so for now it suit my purpose and budget in the future i will save and invest in a better machine and proper grinder so i look forward to the rest of your review with interest i have got a little beko machine that cost me gbp59 use it with the wilfa grinder on a mocca setting give me the crema i have been missing during lock down until the cafe open again i saw that de longhi on picture in e shop i thought the tamper is magnetically attached like in breville sage dddd i would be really interested to see a video on the minimum requirement spending to make excellent coffee i have always been a bit hesitant on spending too much on coffee equipment knowing what you consider a minimum would be super helpful i love those what is better video it is really helpful and great keep doing that and please do some beehouse guiddddde i am cry in melitta right now curious to hear thought on the sage breville duo temp found a good deal on it for about dollar200 australian dollar heard good thing and it ha non pressurised option a nespresso machine will produce better coffee when you are on a budget next video idea can you buy a good used espresso machine for under gbp100 looking forward to that machine you find that is cheap and good d can already see the annoyance on his face a soon a he started touching the 1st machine that is what we are all here for my girlfriend found me a second hand krups bravo 871 for like dollar10 a couple year ago which i have used off and on and enjoyed i am guessing i am making some subpar espresso that taste good to my own barbaric palate but i do wonder how much more i would be enjoying the experience with a better machine please say yes please say yes i have a very similar delonghi it is ok but not barista good i have now bought the sage barista touch pretty sure you will recommend one of sage is machine in a similar video to this one what would be the next go to upgrade after my setup delonghi dedica graef cm800 do you think i should change the grinder i am very unhappy with my dedica but do not know what to do after this i am only drinking cappucino great video love your shirt have a wonderful day i have a 30 year old saeco aroma which also us a pressurized portafilter it is obviously not a good a an unpressurized option although such a basket ha been made by third party but at least the machine itself is well built all metal made in italy even water distribution halfway decent steam wand it is definitely a more acceptable option but were it still available it would cost quite a bit more than any of these machine here from my experience for the last 40 year i went through many espresso machine with the 15 bar of pressure and so far the best one out of all of them is deloghi icona the secret lay in the design of the filter basket you can dismantle it for cleaning it ha 3 part that screw into the basket that is what make a good frothy espresso i have been using it for the last 10 year never let me down a perfect espresso every time you want a good espresso buy the bean not the already ground bean is trail and error to find good bean high strength no 5 the machine cost around gbp160 but you can grab a second hand for about gbp50 ebay facebook market or gumtree check it out james i guarantee you will not be disappointed way better then than the one that cost over gbp400 i would love to see james pulling shot with a manual lever machine like a la pavoni sprolever i know this video but it is very hard to pull good shot from a la pavoni europiccola for example because of the price tag around 800euros and without any modification smart espresso profiler that would be interesting just watch is olympus cremina review thanks james you should check the delonghi eco 311 too haven t watched it but this is just what i needed i hope i ll be able learn what to look for in a cheap espresso machine on the which machine to have an experience hobby of coffee making i always seem to think that the manual one are better i love my flair because of how fiddly it is in a way i can experiment and make good espresso but half the fun is the setting up making just my 2 cent i love your video definitely one of my favourite channel now advise me on what to buy please looking forward to seeing your follow up video i have been eyeing up the de longhi dedica style which is currently gbp189 on amazon seems to have reasonable review but be interested to hear if it is worth spending a bit more for make the low end sage offering james you said the main reason these suck so bad is a pressurized portafilter would it be possible to use a compatible normal 3rd party one would it make a noticable difference bought a sunbeam barista max machine recently local nz and auz brand iirc nzdollar400 gbp200 btw my whole coffee obsession being kicked into next gear is your fault james hooked me during lockdown anyway it ha a built in grinder not great but doe the job 58mm porta filter with unpressurized basket wa kinda surprised about that programmable single and double shot button and normal single hole steam wand i have pulled some pretty decent shot with it for the money if you are in nz or auz well worth a look if the breville sage to the british barista express price is a bit too steep for you sure wa for me bean do make a difference of course i get mine from a local roaster so well fresh but seems to do ok with store bought bean a well edit kmart sell a rebranded swan retro too one look in the shop and that wa an immediate no from me p i can not wait for the video which will reveal the cheapest machine that make great coffee amazing mission dear james greeting from hungary if you are going to settle for okay then just get a moka pot and save a bunch of dough is the rubber gasket not for ese type coffee capsule bag james try the ariete vintage espresso machine i have friend that can not believe i spent dollar250 u for my dualit toaster and i think the same will go for an espresso machine when i eventually purchase one i have been curious about cheaper espresso machine for a while now and i am glad you reviewed these i will just save my money and buy something that will not break the bank but will make consistently good great espresso i hope you will review a group of espresso machine in 250 pound arena next brilliant thank you for this video i really look fwd to the machine you do pick i would be super keen on your view on how some of the manual espresso puller like the rok and co compare to similarly priced espresso machine when you get to that market segment i have had my rok for year and i reckon i pull a pretty good coffee through it but i have not even looked at a home machine co i figured i would have to spend a lot more to get something i would be satisfied with can you thay a look on beko coffee machine i hope you will do a review or a contest for all in one espresso machine i mean those with grinder built in i really want to know how cheap i can get in order to get a good coffee with this kind of machine i am planning to get one but do not know how good they can be and which brand should i go for breville seems a good choice but the price is not yes we definitely need the bare minimum video the sooner the better thank you james this wa super informative and useful for someone with my budget do not buy new get a 2nd hand gaggia classic or rancillio silvia from ebay or gumtree my first espresso machine wa a gaggia cubika which cost me gbp30 i then got a gaggia classic which had been modded with a silvia steam wand and a cunill tauro for gbp120 i have that delonghi and it is not fun to use really i can not complain too much since i found a brand new one still sealed on letgo for dollar25 so i am not out much money it brew ok espresso at best and dreadful espresso at worst my best shot have still been a far way away from what i can get at a good coffee shop at some point i will save up and replace it with something better but i do have some more ski gear that i am planning on getting first hilarious a always and a very interesting topic i am curious how the delonghi deca would hold up in comparison it cost twice a much and the bambino from sage is about three time the value and once you get in to higher priced machine how do the automatic coffee machine fare are you just paying for convenience at this point or do you get great tasting coffee great video great title thank you james reinforces my purchase of the flair pro 2 no end for it durability bang for buck and sheer endless searching for the best shot hi james have you ever thought of designing your very own espresso machine you know what component are needed where they fit and what standard of quality they need to be and how they need to perform i think you should look into it i am sure all your viewer me included would rather buy a machine designed by you than any of these shown the water is more important than the tool then come the coffee how timely video i am currently researching espresso machine to buy so far on my list for a good but relatively cheap espresso machine are gaggia classic pro not a plastic toy like the one in this video cheap for a real espresso machine both good and bad 1 aluminum boiler could corrode can not brew and steam at the same time temperature surfing needed to produce quality drink the old version is very popular could be easy to diy fix rancilio silvia like the gaggia but a bigger brass boiler can rust perhaps too expensive for what you get temperature surfing needed to produce quality drink popular relatively easy to find fixing guide and component ascaso steel uno professional thermoblock no traditional boiler very fast to heat up compared to a boiler machine thermoblock could have weak but unlimited steaming power temperature surfing needed to produce quality drink a rarity but my local shop ha one for sale nuova simonelli oscar 2 cheapest heat exchanger in existence can brew and steam at the same time thanks to hx no temperature surfing but cooling flush needed gob of steaming power bulky and ugly imo despite plasticy body actual commercial quality component inside rated for commercial use more difficult to service yourself you have to open the machine to remove limescale for example fairly popular the oscar 2 is what i am probably going to buy since it can steam and brew at the same time but do you guy have any thought which one should i pick or are there cheaper machine that can make real espresso without a pressurised filter get a szarvasi if you can bought a delonghi machine in about 4 dollar in a sale this is where my espresso journey actually started about 3 year ago you can make good milk drink but it not a good experience for the price what is the manufacturing is benefit to design the portafilters with the two hole i think it result in le machine being returned from impulse buyer who expect to get crema from pre ground bean they buy in the supermarket i have the delonghi or atleast it is previous version which is more plastic based and le stuff but pull a decent shot often i will go one up on the grind setting or use my wilfa on moka setting alot of the control can be done with how much coffee you add and how much you press in tamping to regulate the flow rate but tbh i have pulled better shot on it than i have had in some caf s imo and it is lasted me the past 7 year with no issue james if you check insta i sent you some pic i would love a series of video about espresso machine and to get an idea of what i the bare minimum i love my moka pot but a espresso would be awesome here would really love to see a video on reviewing some bean to cup coffee machine that create coffee that contain milk hi james thanks a lot for another great video just one question i have got the espresso machine delonghi ec685 and the total time 25 to 30 second for getting 28 to 30g out is pre infusion time included or not thanks a lot and keep up good work thanks jarda hey james i am student that love coffee but i only have about gbp30 or le to spend of a coffee appliance what would you recommend i like coffee all form i just want to be a good a i can get it at home great video with a great conclusion at the end this would have been useful 3 week ago for now i am making do with a beko manual espresso machine for gbp79 of course you have a marc rebillet t shirt so many question the retro one in brazil would cost a lot more man also i have a similar delongui hahhaha all you described is true also i get cold too fast and take forever to heat up i recently received a gaggia classic machine and have been very pleased with it it performs very well for a small countertop machine maybe add that one too your list to review nice video nice shirt please review the delonghi ec 685 thanks it help yes wa hoping you would do a vid like this interesting and informative video my money stay in my wallet for the moment a a result but would definitely like to know the minimum spend to get something that pass muster shoot that soon please could you do a video on the used market i got a gaggia classic for gbp120 and it is pretty solid and very simple to open up and clean replace part on i also think that the resell value on this will not go down much between now and when i sell it to get a better machine in the future the used route seems more sensible to me albeit with a little risk but that can be mitigated if you know what you are looking for very excited for the next in the series would love to start making espresso at home and trust it is money well spent i would like to see you make a video where you show u the best bang for the buck coffee machine i wa close to get one of these but now i will hold off and wait for your video on what is the lowest requirement for a proper machine looking forward to it i would be interested to see how these machine would work if you bought a couple extra supply for example buy a replacement regular portafilter and a good tamper that you like using of course factor that into the price is it possible to change portafilters or is there some inherent flaw with the machine that requires it anyway i get that adding a bunch of modification sometimes is not worth it and it probably would not make a difference this time but next round it might for the price what is the manufacturing is benefit to design the portafilters with the two hole waiting eagerly to learn what that bare minimum could be and can you do a session on different portafilters and their importance impact to the brewing process that is the video i been waiting for all my life james doe the best review he try them so you do not have to pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease review the rancilio silvia doe given them away not make you a hypocrite you can not give them away or it will undermine your moral ground either recycle them in a way least harmful to the environment or modify them so they produce good coffee man i own that krups feel bad is james hoffman falling into the trap of being snooty for show for the last few month i have perceived an increase in the use of the grimace shtick i find myself predicting it am often proved correct and while initially amused am now a bit jaundiced by it all is it sufficient to discourage people from watching all together because sigh another gate keeping coffee snob gosh this video on my birthday that doe not bode well for my wallet but let me get some bean first i had the delonghi it wa exactly a you described it good but finicky i got it for free but even then i think it is worth the price a it spurted my search for a cheap good espresso machine i now own a rok and am super happy with it even though getting the grind exactly right is a pain i will one day get a e61 or a lever machine but until that time my trusty rok is being used every single day and i do not think i would have ever gotten to this point without the delonghi so yes there is better but i would recommend the wasted money to see if you like the routine every morning the delonghi did go into a cupboard after 2 week and wa replaced with an aeropress for 2 year after coming to a rok great t shirt nice to see a fellow marc rebillet fan not likely a common opinion but i wa a bit disappointed with this video you can get some cheap replacement unpressurised basket and 3rd party tamper it seems a bit unfair to judge these machine purely on these replaceable accessory in a pinch while waiting for a cheap unpressurised basket for a cheap machine to arrive i have even resorted to roughly using a hacksaw to open the hole a fair bit larger so it played a much lesser role in extraction pressure i have tried using vitamin container a adlib tamper it is not hard to be better then those plastic scoop style tamper i think if you are answering the question on whether you can do this for say under 100 pound one it is unsatifying to stick to only what is in the box of the machine a 60 pound machine surely ha enough left over for a generic basket if it is a standard size i realise that i have not had decent cup of coffee in year i lived in japan for a year and had the best coffee related experience there it is sad how quickly i got on with mediocre brew since then this channel ha helped me enormously thank you james i did a kickstarter on a product you had featured neo is new flair i would love to see what you think about it v the pro model you had featured on your channel earlier also my brother and i have had 20 25 year old krup is machine that we like a lot better and look a lot different then the newer model i have been using the delonghi for close to 4 year now the first two year i spent with the machine were frustrating but after buying a better grinder i have now reached a point where i can consistently pull a decent shot in the morning do i want a better machine yes am i in desperate need of a better machine no i enjoy the coffee i make out of it i am however interested on what would be the next step up should i choose to upgrade testing the steam wand for these cheap machine would be something i would like to see you had me at the deja vu joke i officially adore you i would like to see the inverse given a good espresso machine how much do you have to spend on a grinder that krups machine 5 45 reminds me of a movie i watched if you know what i mean i almost bought one a few year ago in the sale but then decided not to go ahead a i had a good cafeti re already and preferred to get my caffeine fix that way instead and do espresso when out amp about or at work where we have a big fancy one kmart in australia sell the same machine a the swan retro and a company called choice said that it beat a dollar949 competitor in flavour lol what about can you get a decent pour over cup with cheap grinder i need to find some use for my delonghi kg79 a a poor college student i owned the delonghi machine i thought it wa generally okay but it broke within a year and it wa a mess to clean i agree with the porta filter and holding it in there with the flip thing statement kinda awkward definitely a decent machine though for those who do not have too much money i reckon you could get a used gaggia classic or similar for gbp100 i would sooner recommend a good pour over solution than a cheap espresso machine even if they are different drink james i wish you would test the brevelle barista express when you click the like button before you have even watched it i am always amazed by james ability to make such a complex niche subject accessible and engaging it is a dose of knowledge passed slowly through the hoffmann brew chamber extracting personality and humour to yield an interesting effervescent shot of insight i may be an addict this is precisely the stooping i have been waiting to see from you i know you always get to play with high end gadget but so so many people without the fund or sense buy these ultra cheap option and i have always wanted to hear your opinion in response to the title i am not sure i would pay that much for an espresso something like entry level lelit machine i actually brewed better with this exact delonghi than with gaggia classic i wish this video came out earlier before i brought a cheap espresso machine totally agreed with james im really looking forward to the bare min video ive been waiting for a video on what the best value maschine is for age would love a budget video for second hand coffee machine know a lot of people talk about the gaggia classic a a great budget coffee machine and i see them go for under gbp100 and i managed to get a rancilio silvia for about gbp200 i think it would be interesting to see around that price point anyway did not you say that grinder can not grind finely enough for espresso how do the result of these compare with nespresso pod like already other people said could you please do a video about a decent espresso machine around 300 gbp i watch your video now since quiet a while and i know that good a espresso machine can not cost le than 100gbp but i think many of your viewer simply can not spend arround 1k including a mill it would be also way overpowerd for my single houshold so jeah i would enjoy a budget espresso machine and mill video thanks anyways for the good content beside tha fact that it ha turned me a bit in a espresso snob just bought the capresso cafe pro for 250 dollar seems like an ok machine even come with a naked portafilter arrghhh 100 percent agree i agree with him about the delonghi a the best of what he reviewed here because i had one and it produced an okay shot not great but not bitter it wa all i could afford at the time however in april i bit the bullet and got the gaggia classic and a good grinder i had to get used to it and figure a few thing out but it make espresso a good a a coffee shop i just got a bottomless portafilter i will be trying for the first time in the morning thesailor450 yes i love mine one answer delonghi dedica deluxe i think you are looking for the aldi machine i have a small kitchen so i use a delonghi dedica with a bottomless porterfilter and non pressurized basket sold separately and a eureka mignon i am learning i decided to buy a better grinder to serve me 10 year and buy a better coffee machine when i have a bigger kitchen really enjoy watching your video i bought an espresso machine since i discovered your channel thank you could you please test their milk foam function could not you just cheat and make a moka pot espresso james ha done a video on brewing with a moka pot i believe he just doe not consider that espresso it is a completely different brewing method i am pretty sure he is also covered brewing not espresso in an aeropress you just are not forcing water through a bed of finely ground coffee at the same pressure a what is needed for espresso i think and on this terrible disappointment needed d for anyone looking at getting a budget espresso machine buy used lower end espresso machine especially from italian manufacturer usually have fairly simple replaceable part and are easy to service and maintain which mean they last for year with no real deterioration i got an almost 10 year old gaggia classic for le than 100 pound and the previous owner even gave me a nice metal tamper and a few extra basket for the portafilter i replaced the gasket and the shower screen and it is been working perfectly for more than a year now buying used is better for the environment so there is that maybe next time review breville dual boiler and similar good review he is feature a breville once or twice just search the channel for sage a breville are not called breville in the uk they are sage instead nah i bought a gaggia classic pro d i have the delonghi a birthday gift from my amazing girlfriend yes it is basic but it is a fantastic entrypoint into coffee in my opinion because a student we do not have hundred of euro to spend on a machine so it is the best we can do right now and honestly i love it or the time to dial in a machine if you wear umbro t shirt and just want a quick coffee a delonghi is a good cheap option the search for the sweet spot in espresso machine go on the optimum price range that make good coffee nice work james i always have a question is that why they make those stupid machine it is never gon na to make just normal espresso and at the same price nespresso can make much better coffee than anyone i know many people might hate nespresso but it is also the true and it even save you money for a grinder i think nespresso and similar pod use a similar idea a the pressurised basket shown using a courser grind and restricting water flow through the grind using a small number of small hole it is three i think rather than one the grind are somewhat stale though the capsule are nitrogen flushed reducing oxidation and they create a lot of waste and the price per capsule v what you save on equipment add up quickly the price per gram of the pod is i think many time more than the price per gram of fresh coffee sold by local roaster there wa a moment of what the hell at 0 58 when james said andrew james considering my name is andrew janes i might have to play that back a few time anyway and ignore the fact that i almost share my name with a po espresso machine o i think we almost saw james throw up hey james i love your video at home i use delonghi dedica which also came with a pressurised basket but i got one non pressurized from amazon that fit right in and also can hold 18 instead of 12g of coffee it made a huge improvement but down the line i would love to get a bit better machine maybe at some point you could review espresso machine in the dedica price range i would love to see that thanks thanks for the video i have a delonghi dedica which doe have a pressurised basket i really struggle to make a good tasting espresso but milky coffee are fine should i buy myself a different portafilter or just consider a better machine i would rather get cheapest flair classic than cheap electric machine i say yes to d j brew thank you for making this and for the planned similar video coming up the aldi machine review really felt like a put down of any cheap machine without due consideration so it is good to see you take the time to look at machine like this properly you have just gained a patreon supporter alright mr hoffman we are desperate i move a lot i rarely have a square meter to spare on my counter but want to try making my own espresso can you recommend me an espresso machine that fit my need that marc rebillet shirt tho recently discovered this maniac he is dope d googling marc rebillet i am so glad he is blown up i started tuning in during his first few livestreams at the brewing company when he had about 2000 subscriber i have the delonghi and hario skerton alongside and they serve me well sometimes it is a bit frustrating and definitely i drink le coffee because of it that setup is in my opinion great kickstarter into coffee world and it showed me how good tasting this drink can be d i see james ha great taste in music love the rebillet shirt i have the one exactly same a amazon basic not sure what wa the price a i got it a a gift when i started learning about coffee i can not grind too fine a the liquid will spew out from the seal i generally use it for lower grade stale bean to practise latte art or just a milk based drink i have been using it for 6 year for good coffee i stick to my favourite method of french press would be interesting to see if you could modify the delonghi to make it more usable maybe add some temperature and pressure guages and a better power delivery system what about semi automatic machine is there a way to dial them in properly i do have the de longhi and yes it is loud very loud i have it more then 2 year a you mentioned it is making okay coffee what i can confirm i made a video about the machine in hungarian on my youtube channel but if i wan na have better espresso i have to use my astoria tanya what is sitting in my living room great content from you a always have a great day you too when i started my espresso journey i bought a 98 gaggia classic off ebay for 80euros best decision i have ever made in my opinion i got rid of it last year when i got a brand new europiccola now i m waiting for another gaggia in the post yes waiting for the minimum for good espresso video perfectly timed video thinking of purchasing one but not sure what to get would be interesting to see the machine go out to some aspiring coffee machine hacker to see if it is possible to alter the machine to improve them james i feel like you really did not like any of these machine what espresso machine do you use at home can you do more review at various other price point perhaps review range of dollar300 dollar500 dollar501 dollar750 dollar751 dollar1 000 dollar1 001 dollar1500 dollar1 501 dollar2 000 etc in whatever seems like reasonable price range i realize you can spend probably a much a you want but for home espresso maker where is the sweet spot on function and affordability perhaps you give pointer on feature and parameter that prospective buyer should look for like how many bar minimum maximum should you look for etc lol there is an article for the first machine potentially being better than 900 dollar machine to find the answer to the minimum investment espresso i have watched so many video of yours and still not a solid answer yet please go above 100 and stay under 300 that probably would be a good range for me to start a hobby and i would assume for many other people i got one a different brand for around gbp100 which came with a pressurized portafilter and true enough making espresso became a chore i love coffee but it wa frustrating when the water would sputter out and ruin it i probably should have saved up for a better machine i have been living with a machine that can do it but like you say it is not enjoyable nor is it reliable i am just in the market to spend a fair sum on an espresso machine keeping in mind i am very much entry into espresso and i will still prefer other brew method so price limited to some extent to ensure i have a good standard that is reliable these video would be of great interest i love watching your vids in the morning a i have my coffee such a relaxing experience i bought a philip saeco poemia in 2012 a an everyday machine similarly priced pressurised portafilter it bend a shown at one of these machine by james to the point that i cracked the housing and had to fix it it is very loud and it make be autiful espresso if you have a good grinder graef i have pulled around 7 000 double espresso by now i reckon you have to know it well to tweak it water temperature amanual pre infusion etc and it tends to explode when you accidentally leave the heating dial at foam for too long and then remove the portafilter recommend the gaggia classic narrator you can not i do not know if you already made such a video but could you do a budget friendly starter pack recommendation so everything from machine and grinder to scale and other item you need to make good espresso at home gaggia classic pro with a baratza 270 is the cheapest decent setup 700ish american dollar i wa just watching this video to get a nice collection of james wouldisgusted face and saying e d great video and big thanks for stopping u from testing these thing with our own money james are not nespresso dolce gusto and other coffee capsule based machine a way better option in this price range at least in term of taste i would personally stick to a moka pot or an aeropress with metal filter although the coffee is not actually espresso finally plea do more of these asap im looking forward to the good affordable espresso machine video currently looking at the lelit marax but im not 100percent certain yet we need a brewdaddy x loopdaddy collab asap i have the delonghi it is ok looking forward to your choice for bare minimum machine will upgrade to one of those i feel like most people here would switch the pressurized basket for regular one so it would be interesting to see how these machine perform with third party basket i have seen multiple video of people modding the delonghi dedica with non pressurized basket sawing off the weird spout part etc this is exactly what i wa wondering good grinder cheap machine ok ish espresso you cleared my uncertainty with a proper demonstration i highly recommend to try the delonghi dedica it is one of the most underrated espresso machine out there some people also fitted it with unpressurized basket and they got excellent result looking forward to the bare minimum episode 6 01 that tamper comment made me laugh more then it should could u do this for machine under gbp200 gbp300 a well i have the delonghi dedica with the similar delongi grinder unfortunately it s again pressurized but the filter can be changed perhaps i m fooling myself into thinking it s not that bad on a budget but would love to see a review of one if not booth even the name krups reminds me of lt corpse gt my thought go out to all that coffee that had to go into these horrible monstrosity such a waste well not a waste if people learn not to buy this rubbish such a waste of resource to produce crap it will break within a year and end up in landfill anyway my setup delonghi dedica sage smart grinder pro a good tamper and unpressurozed filter and a cheap scale using my watch for timing waiting for the next video budget ish espresso machine or even better a video with the list of easiest to mod upgrade espresso machine 200 400 range i have a delonghi ec155 entry level machine with a pressurized basket got it for dollar75 and bought a separate tamper with it make drinkable coffee nothing too great i rely on my moka pot and v60 far too often is it better to buy a secondhand machine that used to be expensive good i have got a refurbished breville venezia that i bought a few year ago and it is not the greatest for sure but i have managed to get it to give me half decent shot especially given that it cost me about dollar150 cad i use a baratza encore to grind at about 10 not the finest but not bad i do have a little nest egg growing to get myself a nice upgrade but this doe the trick for now my office ha that delonghi and i completely agree with the usage wow it is frustrating have you reviewed the breville sage barista express pro i can not find it on your page if not would you consider it think i will stick to cold brew easier to make always consistent perhaps the gbp200 sage duo temp pro could be that lowest point have a look at used machine a lot of value can be had there i would love to see you review a few machine to see what the cost value quality breakdown is at different price point hello i live in qu bec and and a friend bought a cuisinart em 100c expresso machine run about 199dollar canadian on amazon or 239 99 at canadian tire she bought it and then put in the cupboard a you said so often happens she sold it to me for 20dollar i knew it wa not high end so for 20dollar i didnt feel bad i wa surprised to see it cost so much for what it is pressured basket and kinda loud and kinda shaky but not horribly i do enjoy making espresso with it although i feel i could enjoy the experience more if you do a video on machine ranginh from 100dollar 350dollar ish i hope you can get your hand on one of these because i would love to hear your opinion i thank you for your passion and please continue making video showing u your passion it why i watch your video over others many people do not show their passion if you have gbp100 buy a moka pot and spend the other gbp80 on whatever make you happy yes yes yes i wanted this video so much morning james and that your answer is exactly what i have come to the conclusion of just doing five minute of research lol the cheapest easiest and best espresso machine i found is the gaggio pro classic what coffe grinder is it the one he recommends some tuning and customization needed to get good espresso from cheap machine 1 pressure most of them do not have opv or have opv at 10 11 bar set it down a little to 9 bar 2 temperature it is better if coffee machine ha a boiler and if boiler combined with group you are lucky just install some boiler insulation and temperature will be more stable 3 portafilter buy new one or remove pressurized basket of course it make sense if you already have a good grinder tuned cheap coffee machine could make one good espresso but not two or more good espresso in a row i have been dying to find a way to turn down pressure from 15 bar to 9 bar on my klarstein passionata capresso ec100 any diyers out there with a hint or direction for me to explore i have taken the machine apart but do not know how to make head and tail of it adam f are you sure that it is non adjustable i am sure that it is simple and cheap to change it or just buy a used pre 2015 gaggia classic for gbp100 120 and be merry so frustrating that gaggia classic pro ha non adjustable 12bar opv  for anyone looking for a good espresso machine under gbp100 just keep an eye on used gaggia machine on ebay for gbp30 i got a used gaggia espresso that is the actual model name from 1996 and it make way better espresso than any of the sage breville machine i have used before when paired with a eureka mignon grinder i had the swan before upgrading to a sage barista express massive massive upgrade would recommend that machine to anyone looking to purchase something in the mid priced kind of range hopefully james will feature it on his channel in the future if not look up a channel called hoons coffee his channel is essentially dedicated to the barista express if you want to watch a few video on it i bought the swan about a month ago it make solid milk drink and ok espresso there wa a noticable improvement in experience if you use a better tamper in hindsight i would have spent a little more but i am curious to see whether you can get a non pressurised basket in that size i stepped up my coffee game during quarantine but did not want to spend dollar600 on a machine my parent had one in the cabinet that they never used a hunk of plastic by krups made in the 70 it ha never pulled a good shot steam would pour out of where the portafilter connects and i felt wa dangerous to use the manual warns that you must vent the steam manually using the fixed steam wand or the pressurized portafilter may explosively decompress but venting the steam wand mean scalding water being blasted all over the counter top sine the wand is fixed i used it for a week gave up bought a hand grinder and a french press and fresh bean from a local roaster i still want to make good espresso at home one day once i save up enough for a breville barista express the way you talk about cheap espresso machine are discouraging new coffee lover even most areal coffee person in italy are okay with moka pot idk why you are act soo high jadoei13 what i mean is he drink bad espresso like he just ate some turd or diarrhea or whatsoever im sorry but imo he is over worshiping espresso coffee iam a diehard coffee lover lucky enough to have a good espresso machine in my kitchen and have another one for my rooftop personal cafe i even bought another one for my mom house and another for the office even no one us it because i just want some coffee everywhere i can but still okay with bad espresso or even coffee from street vendor in this video yes the espresso maybe not good but not bad enough like it wouldisgusting thats just discouraging not everyone have access to good espresso machine or even people who curious to get some latte for himself he should promote and encouraging coffee to everyone not act like an espresso god and shouting wouldisgusting peasant to everyone who drink espresso from dollar60 machine im not saying he is wrong the cheap espresso is bad yes but if it me disgusting isnt the word i pick jay francis yeah just like your video no one else watch it except your mom dad grandad blablabla he already stated that he doe not make espresso in the morning he just us a breville sage precision pour over machine he ha talked highly of the manual lever machine that are not all that expensive he also ha stuff on the v60 and aeropress this is not about acting high it is just that temp control matter and so doe channeling extraction if you get both of those completely wrong your coffee will taste disgusting he more or le gave the delongi a reccomendation i wa pretty suprised that it did that well if he wa acting like you are claiming why not just talk only about the bad side of these thing cause there are a lot more negative thing he could say about these machine from the non existance of a boiler a useless steamwand or their probably short lifespan i think he wa pretty positive about these machine but they also just will not be the same a a prosumer machine like one from profitec lelit ecm he is done at least one video on getting good coffee from a moka pot plus i am pretty sure james being disgusted is what the people want anyway starting out on cheap equipment it is good to know what the limitation of that equipment are sure it is fun to get started with coffee a a hobby but it is frustrating too trying to troubleshoot why your coffee is much worse than the your local cafe make with the same bean is also discouraging i do not see the big deal with those tamper scoop they are really easy to use even if they are not great ergonomically i think the ergonomics are a factor but in the way that you can not really do a firm tamp either with the pro technique nor a hold that feel more natural for the scoop design the latter migh see the stem part bend and either way it is very hard to be level there is usually an angle that encourages some unevenness of flow and then there is a seem down the middle of the tamp part of many of them due to the split moulding process that put a seem in the bed and mean any rotation of the tamper after tamping scrap up the tamped coffee a bit that is my experience anyway oh and in my experience they often have a poor fit leaving quite a bit of room well quite a bit still mean under 1mm between the tamper and the wall of the basket ready to purchase the lelit bianca when it get back in stock uk fully understand what i am getting myself into and i can not wait for someone who want to get into espresso in a big way i do not see any machine under gbp700 gbp800 beating a cafelat robot it is a beast you thought i wa going to say deja brew but i did not because i do not hate you or me had me cackling like a witch good sir you have just saved my gbp100 i am planning to buy an espresso machine within roughly this budget and now this review i guess i would wait a while and increase my budget to buy something better please go down this rabbit hole i need to know which is the cheapest espresso machine that is worth buying i think manual espresso machine will when in the cheapest way to drink very good cup of coffee my very first machine wa a breville cafe rom i machined the portafilter and found a regular filter basket that fit the portafilter with good bean and a good conical burr grinder it made drinkable espresso that could pas for a higher end machine although since then i have gotten into manual espresso with la pavoni couldnt afford a rocket something to be said for the texture that can be produced with hand lever pressure v a high vibrating pump please include nespresso a an alternative to cheap espresso machine to see whether it the best cheap home coffee machine especially for those who do not want a hobby kikkirow it is possible let be honest though there is still a lot of waste even dealing with recycling pod and the vast majority of pod end up in landfill a it is not all that convenient it not like you can put them in your standard recycling bin ed fireman but is it more yuk than the one tested here that is what i wan na know yuck tommy you can recycle nespresso pod so your statement is incorrect unless you are talking about something related to the sourcing of the coffee from the nespresso pod nespresso is great for people who hate the planet why doe not square mile look into machine if you could create an affordable but very good espresso making machine you would corner the home market 8 56 some video filter go off delonghi dedica 685 is propably the best bang for buck machine i rarely drink coffee and i find myself watching him often just a nice voice to listen to while i am home alone what about a bialetti brikka it is not an espresso machine but supposedly it make espresso i have something similar to these for few month it is gon na be good if you can get non pressurized basket then i bought flair espresso maker that is a whole new world breville sage infuser is pretty good i have been using it at home for a couple of year with consistent result it us a slightly smaller than standard portafilter but once you get used to it it is pretty good i think it is very good value at a lower price point of around dollar250 to dollar350 australian dollar combined with a commandante grinder it work really well could you do a video on a good pour over press setup for under gbp100 starting to think that i will never buy a machine before i knew anything about espresso i bought a breville venezia 90gbp and a gefu lorenzo hand grinder after finding your channel and watching many video i bought a single wall portafilter for it to try and get thing better that machine had massive issue i think similar to that aldi machine you reviewed in particular any time i grinded too fine hot water would explode out the gasket thinking the seal wa not right enough i 3d printed a spacer to sit between the filter basket and portafilter that helped make it far tighter occasionally though it would still spew coffee everywhere i also found that the grinder did not have enough adjustment capability for certain bean two adjacent setting either caused the machine to explode or watery mess to run through the only upside to going this path wa that starting so cheap and going through all of that i learned enough to make a far more informed decision when it came to spending niche zero money i got an ex demo model of one of the more expensive delonghi model which came with a pressurised portafilter swapped it for a normal basket and eventually a naked portafilter and got a better tamper and if i run a couple of empty shot through first to get the head and the portafilter up to a stable temp i can pull consistently good shot total cost including my addtiions about gbp130 and a bit of practice dialling in the process for the combination of caffination need and low budget of a phd student then it work great for me maybe an older model brasilia james how do you feel about nespresso machine with pad we have one at work and all my coworker go nut over it i prefer bringing my own since we have that machine i went through several cheap machine the best of the bunch wa a capresso that wa ok until it broke but the rest of them were garbage ended up buying a lightly used gaggia for under dollar200 u and the quality of espresso is light year ahead i had a very very similar delonghi possibly same model year ago and it wa good enough for me it got me into coffee more eventually i upgraded but it served me well for several year i wa wondering if you could replace the pressurised basket would the espresso machine perform better than the one with the agressive channeling you thought i wa gon na say deja brew speaking of affordable espresso any take on the flair neo would love a review and your thought on it thank you please make part 2 soon now i need a video for around the 500dollar range cheer geoff i am very intrested to know how the milk frother is on these machine it seems this is a topic no one talk about in which value category do you also get good milk everyone like you who ha experience making good espresso always hate on pressurized basket but honestly you can find espresso machine for 100 200 dollar that are usable reliable and have decent build quality but there is no grinder good enough for unpressurized basket under 300 what would be the point of spending 150 usd on the coffee machine if you need to spend at least 400 usd on the grinder i would greatly appreciate if people could actually start trying to make decent coffee with pressurized basket everyone always give up in an instant and dismisses it a bad anyone have any experience with taobao or aliexpress expresso coffee machine from my personal experience i have owned similar de longhi machine and other cheap issh machine you are looking at about gbp250 300 before you start getting anything worth while anything much under that and you are in the realm of overpriced cheap tat that can not pull a decent shot to save it is live although i will say having played with and used a far more expensive machine gbp3k i do not think it worth it for most people either for me the sweat spot is between gbp500 gbp800 much more than that and you get diminishing return for some brewing marc cancelled his nz show for obvious reason but i am still so cut what is the bare minimum one would need to spend on a coffee machine to get an acceptable decent espresso james rocking the marc rebellit tshirt prof that james is a man of taste indeed good affordable espresso machine video it would also be interesting for you to do the bare minimum for quality drip some cheaper drip machine apparently hit the target temp one that is not certified that do so is the bonavita bv1500ts i made a purchase of a manual espresso machine the nomad espresso it wa on massive sale and paid 50 pound for a a novice in home espresso brewing it ha been a great enjoyment being able to control all the parameter of the output and producing what i find great quality shot a well well relative to my experience of mainly cafe espresso i would really enjoy seeing a video review of this machine perhaps in the proposed video of the bare minimum for a good experience flair spresso is amazing how do you compare these machine to manual espresso machine like flair or rok so in return what is your recommendation for the cheapest machine to get that can produce decent espresso the sage bambino plus come to mind maybe or is even that one too bad can not you just put a piece of paper to counter the water jet on krupa and amazon basic machine i would like to see this but at slightly higher price point i have been tempted by the sage bambino but i want to see what james think first hahaha i made the mistake to buy a delonghi dedica because i wa frustrated of not having good coffee at home i have used it for 3 month and now it sits quite beautifully i must say unused on my kitchen counter so that upcoming series about the bear minimum for good espresso will be more than welcome 5 20 subtitle say crap for the krups even youtube know it is bad at least it is auto generated subtitle it would be kinda shady if he would have wrote it that way i would have appreciated d j brew this is the real sauce content i have subscribed for extreme channel flavor thanks james this wa really interesting i am looking forward to seeing how much i have to save up for so far the classic gaggia seems popular i am so glad to see a video like this i personally look foward to seeing the best one button plug and play espresso coffee machine philip saeco jura gaggia delonghi but i would imagine that mean a whole lot more patreon support is required thanks for anothet great video james i currently have the delonghi dedica and will look to upgrade at some point to a better machine with non pressurised basket i would be very interested in a future video on a bare minimum good espresso machine snobby guy disgustedly review cheap device used by the peasentry is a pretty fun genere of video i spy with my little eye a sick marc rebillet t shirt i always knew james wa a man of class but this just confirms it i have not watched the video yet but im gon na guess james saying no and also yuck why do i have a sinking suspicion that james hoffman is actually jacked a hell azcomeazgo yeah when he leaned forward towards the espresso machine i saw his arm and wa like huh so is james hoffman jacked i could not help but notice his lat every time he turned sideways wyatt parker funniest comment i have read in a while what i have found most interesting since watching your video is that there is more to coffee than espresso it a precise thing and for good drinking a v60 mocha pot or similar will do nicely i do not need a gbp500 bit of machinery to make a nice drink you do actually that bit of machinery being the grinder perhaps better to save a little bit more and buy a secondhand gaggia classic or something interested to see what your thought a you move up the line i had a delonghi dedica for 5 year but it at the end of it life and i want to move to something better when i replace it knowing that it get daily use justifies the price now we are curious about how manual espresso maker will compare to similarly priced semi automatic oh god i entered this competition prematurely why i really want to see a video of best espresso machine under gbp500 gbp300 level how about breville bambino plus i can not wait for the next video cause i have been saving up for a machine for a long time now and do not want my money wasted lt 3 thanks for the vid wa going to buy the swan but now im going to save my money and stick with my trusty moka pot for a while i see you reppin marc rebillet hell yeah i recently bought a used machine an i am quite happy with it maybe a next video could be can you get a good used espresso machine under xgbp i think if you are under a certain budget it only make sense to go the used route i got lucky for gbp100 and found a 1970s bezzera lever machine on gumtree been my daily machine for 10 year now next video adding a pid to a sub 100 espresso machine i have this one it ha a pressurised porta filter which i did not know wa a bad thing until i watched this video i have always thought it made nice coffee but now i am not too sure since going down the coffee rabbit hole my expectation have changed thanks for the video i have the amazon basic present and my experience ha been different i also bought a non pressurised basket for it and it is pretty good not the best but not awful i am loving the marc rebillet quarantine tour t shirt james excellent review of weird product a always keep safe how good are the machine for steaming milk 10 02 this feel like a personal attack i said a i shamefully deleted item from my amazon cart is no one going to talk about 2 24 i would be interested in seeing a review of the cheapest most awful espresso machine a i have a dollar30 imusa espresso machine the use of sarcastic quotation mark is fully intended i am curious a to whether they are just hot garbage or if you can by some miracle pull a halfway decent espresso shot from them i bought an optional unpressurised basket for a couple of cheap sunbeam thermoblock machine but they kept dying after about a year in way which were uneconomical to fix probably due to our local water which is some of the worst in the world then i bought a lelit single boiler machine and that lasted only a couple of year probably my fault because i still used our awful local water and only back flushed with water rather than a cleaning agent before also being uneconomical to fix so i gave up and just bought a bezerra galatea domus hx machine which i only use spring water with and back flush with a cleaner from my local cafe service supplier in term of grinder i started with a porlex grinder and now i use a lido e i find using a hand grinder keep my coffee intake at a le than lethal level that shirt lt 3 i have recently adopted a delongi like this to try it out nothing great and do not know if it stay or continues it is journey tip it is possible to do somewhat of a pre infusion by turning it on off and wait for it the tamper can be removed from it is akward position after which you can pretend it is a regular tamper breville gaggia classic or a silvia would be your best bet for a cheap espresso machine that actually make good coffee i went for just a step above those with a lelit machine and have been blown away by how good my home espresso is but it costed me about u dollar1500 after buying a good grinder with it totally worth it do not forget that espresso machine are a new hobby that you might not want a lot of people would prefer just pressing a button and getting their morning coffee that taste ok espresso take a lot of effort and a lot of adjustment to yield great coffee it is not easy i bet you thought i wa going to say d j brew but i did not because i do not hate you or me i love you james that sentence from james ha made me feel oddly happy and appreciated still better than the coffee pun derren brown made when james wa on his show can you do a best bang for your buck espresso machine video good review the one thing i would say is you can buy a good machine for gbp100 i bought a second hand gaggia classic for gbp95 just before the lockdown and it work beautifully and help from an environment and recycling perspective pair with a decent 2nd hand grinder and i have got a decent set up for gbp200 the tamper is deeply unpleasant to use the moment you realize someone ha not had a hard time for a while james is an extremely precious man i got a gaggia classic and breville smart grinder for 130 pound used i would much rather that than a brand new what ever these are i have a mr coffee marching i paid dollar15 at a thrift store that make incredible espresso use good water and good coffee a review on a good affordable coffee machine would be very beneficial picked up the de longhi at a car boot sale for gbp3 gave it a good clean and used it for a couple of week not the best but fine for milky drink sold it for gbp50 so i am quite fond of that little machine im wondering if they are making these product bad on purpose to push your spending a bit more now do aliexpress coffee machine and coffee paraphernalia i have a gbp60 mpm one i use pre ground bag of cafe d oro gold in supposed espresso grind which is finer than normal coffee but coarser than espresso it work ok it taste acceptable to me not super fantastic but acceptable and it ha ton of crema i usually just have americanos i did try actual espresso grind once and it did not end well but honestly i am fine with it 5 30 that would destroy the serious image that i have of you but i would still laugh i used to own that delonghi machine once you spend some time with it it is not bad you can get decent coffee out of it but occasionally it would throw it is toy out of the pram the marc rebillet tshirt i already did not like jeff bezos this video did not change that opinion i have got the delonghi and agree it inconsistent i am not sure if i regret buying it on some day the espresso taste in all honesty like excuse my french absolute dogshite while on some day i can muster something more similar to a cafe style espresso i would be interested in your tip and trick on how to get the most out of this machine on a consistent basis keep up the great content super interesting to me a someone who would like to make better espresso but doe not have a big budget do you happen to have an opinion on the seaco aroma model i bought an old used one cause i think it is a neat looking little machine and i really do not like the plastic y feel of the current model and have been trying to get good espresso out of it for a while now i had an old plastic delonghi machine it wa gbp80 on sale i think back in the day making a cappuccino wa a difficult process although i did enjoy the extraction part the use and cleanup especially the cleanup wa awful the amount of mess you make without a decent tamper that fill the entire side i still do not understand why these manufacture can not produce better sized plastic pulling your second coffee for a friend showing off your machine and the pressure built up from the first spray coffee ground all over your top cleaning the plastic station after point 1 and 2 just take a lot of time on these compact plastic machine the drip tray will not catch much just scooping ground with a spoon from your large pre ground not quite suitable for espresso bag into the portafilter is a messy process actually recalling now i used to often get ground from my messy prep into the cup i wa pouring into however i did have mine for a while a year or two and when i upgraded i used it a a steam wand machine for the nespresso at work and for that the delonghi wa actually pretty awesome and much better than the heated milk machine aerator etc you could not get decent microfoam but it did find it is use and wa a welcomed addition to the office it also sparked coffee enthusiast in the office trying to latte art with thick foam which quite a lot of velocity to get it to work how badly do they foam milk i have a different delonghi machine dedica something and if you take out the plastic part you can get rid of the pressurized portafilter and fit a sage filter in there however you need to be careful with grind size it is very easy to grind too fine and completely clog the filter i think the reason may be the too powerful pump compressing the puck what s your take on that please could you create a similar video for electric grinder hand grinding fine coffee multiple time a day at home is taking it toll on me when you will try lapavoni i did not see any video about it i wa soooo disappointed when my gaggia classic arrived more then a decade ago with these amy first espresso machine filter with it fortunately i very quickly got the regular filter i have been happily using the gaggia ever since it is more than 100 gbp though even today and a far a i know it ha again been changed since i purchased it malt amp pepper phillips bought gaggia and changed the design from italian tank to chinesium something they changed it back to the old design after a few year i would love to hear your thought on the europiccola and i think it would be a great fit for an entry level video on starting an espresso hobby i had the delonghi bought it used for 40euros it wa fine especially with my mazzer mini b buy cezve ibrik and ne happy all your life why would you donate terrible machine to anyone great video a you are right the question at hand is a good one i however knew the answer before you started you presented this in a very low level snobbery mode i think it deserved more snob and snark than you gave it looking forward to seeing ur bare minimum i have used this delonghi is predecessor for a couple of year a a first step into espresso making it originally came with 2 different sized pressurized basket with rubber gasket inside when these started to wear out i wa relieved to be able to upgrade to a larger unpressurized basket to try and make real espresso loved the journey the tinkering and the experience however frustrating at time but never got better than okay now i am on the verge of buying a cafelat robot high expectation edit a whole new world the cafelat robot is infinitely better for making espresso at home both when looking at the result and even more so when it come to the user experience it is world apart there wa definitely a learning curve for me but the satisfaction you get when you have created a delicious handmade espresso is incomparable absolutely another price category absolutely worth it the delonghi still get used to steam milk occasionally which it doe okay ish watching his video make me want to drink bad coffee just out of spite see i do not give a shit alternatively buying a second hand old gaggia machine is probably the best bet for sub 100 pound i love the two machine i have picked up although fixing the machine up can bring you up to the 100 pound range i think i have spent about dollar200 aud on new portafilter handle basket and a rubber seal kit but the machine only costing le than dollar50 aud certainly helped me get into my espresso coffee hobby given that these thing do not brew a real espresso anyway the obvious best solution imho is to buy a stainless steel percolator the wilfa grinder and most importantly get the best coffee you can find locally the difference between proper bean and store bought is night and day regardless of brewing setup using poor quality bean is like polishing a turd no matter how good your equipment it is still just a shiny piece of shit in the end do the same video but look at the second hand market you can find there proper 58mm group filter for dirt cheap i have a nespresso machine i have had it for 6 year i am interested in making the move to something better when the nespresso kick the bucket i am following this channel with interest learning what i can thanks dude actually during this time of lockdown i am tempted to buy a cheap brand of espresso machine if i hold off what would you recommend for a decent espresso machine after 13 year working in specialty coffee a few year ago i found myself surprisingly in a different industry i have been working with machine this caliber in my office ever since it is a deeply unpleasant experience but i am glad you had this video i have managed to find a way to have decent enough espresso i am very curious what the lowest level you would recommend would be i am ready to invest a little more hey james you should look at this espresso machine that cost r 3450 about gbp35 85 i have been using this for a while now it make garbage espresso but milk drink are passable no matter how good a coffee i use i can not get crema from this machine more importantly there is no grind setting possible that can extract a good 1 2 ration in 25 30 i can get a really nice espresso from my gaggia classic and a baratza encore with upgraded burr which everything together is below 400 eur before you give all that hate saying that the encore can not grind for espresso listen to me upgrading for a better grinder will increase significan notly the price of my setup and will not improve the taste of the cup a much the ratio setup price quality is not linear also the limiting factor in the quality of my espresso cup is my limited technique and current understanding of espresso brewing having a grinder that doe not allow a fine tuning of the grind setting made me learn a lot about brewing espresso i have learned how to play with the dose to overcome the not so great grinding right now i can brew espresso within the correct brewing time and tasting great also saving money in the setup allows me to spend more money on what matter the most buying good quality coffee so the overall message is upgrade your setup when the limiting step is the equipment and not your technique or your understanding of brewing espresso i am using an italian bialetti mocha stainless steel it doe not make a real espresso but cost le and i like the taste of the coffee it make i use a bodum bur grinder not the best but good enough for me i have used that delonghi at my girlfriend parent house and it wa very disappointing but they thought it made great coffee agree with the tamper design on it though awful location for a tamper great video been looking forward to james hoffman to review these espresso machine i have been using this exact delonghi machine for a couple year now paired with a sage pro grinder and a real tamper made to measure for the unpressurised basket it is not great at getting a good expression out of single origin bean but i get some really good result using the espresso blend my local cafe buy take some learning to understand it flow and temperature but it really doe work reasonably well and i am not just saying that because i got the machine for free from a friend interesting the first yellowish thing is being sold nearly identical but black at kmart in australia had one for over a year not very consistent but i got good tasting shot with it most of the time i did however use 20 gram of coffee bit much looking back but it worked my new breville pull more consistent shot but i do not feel like it is better tasting overall a shape that make me slightly uncomfortable james hoffman 2020 phalic tamper included took me a minute to understand the context but it make sense it sound like the title of an erotic lovecraft fan fiction do we need to put the bean in slowly again giggity very nice review at 10 minute perfect length and your review wa fair given that you usually enjoy high end espresso further i just love when the machine disappoint you d my husband bought without research what i think is the next up from that krups gbp130 and i have been dicking around with different grind not realising it is a pressurised portafilter infuriating and loud machine with a stupid steam wand i am glad to see your new rate of video publication i enjoy receiving notification of a new video and you deliver great interesting content thanks to drive our attention with weird coffee degustation experiment and great technical review stay a you are or not but continue to transmit your passion of coffee no matter what topic again quality content your video are always a pleasure great content a always james would appreciate a similar one on budget grinder what can you get for say sub gbp75 i had the delonghi machine for a couple of year bought second hand for about gbp15 i eventually gave it away after realising that at best what it produced wa not a nice a well brewed stovetop coffee and it wa hard to clean and much le fun to use looking forward to the bare minimum expresso machine hopefully it come with a compatible grinder recommendation again with top quality thanks instead of 100 just get an aeropress anything below 500 seems to be crap just got my first machine for not much more than this budget second hand gaggia classic hoping it doe better than these at this price point getting a manual lever machine like flair is by far the best choice really looking forward to these future video i bought a usd40 machine from the supermarket in 1996 for funsies i ended up using it to make really strong shot of tea you should take a look at the electrolux eea111 espresso machine i should be in the same price range my parent bought one of the lidl brand espresso machine and it ha the same problem a the krups where it just dig a big hole in the puck make pretty nasty coffee can you review some quick mill machine they are super reliable small and quite good for the price point of euros599 how about a second hand better quality machine what should one look for in a used semiprofessional machine i hade a previous version of the delonghi which seam to be very similar i used it for a have a year to start my hobby making espresso over the time i bought a few additional thing tamper scale a 500 buck grinder after i start grinding with a hand grinder i learned a lot and like to make espresso even more so it wa time to upgrade to a real espresso machine in my case the marax i think this is a good way to start without spending a lot of money right from the beginning i hate to admit it but i bought an ice vanilla latte from starbucks a few month back and i could not figure out why the coffee taste wa so different then i found out it wa espresso fell in love with it growing up my stepdad made espresso all the time he wa from italy strong smell of coffee every morning would love to start making this for myself thanks for another great video love your shirt now can you try to get good espresso out of reusable pod and a nespresso machine great video james could you please release your list of entry level espresso machine and burr grinder to get amazing espresso at home i am really interested in your opinion on the stagg ekg heated kettle please if you cold do a comparison with your brewista and one or 2 others that would be amazing ohh wonder what around dollar300aud would get be like the moment the grouphead eskalation started i literally died this looked like my father watering the garden with his gardena pistol but the pistol is more consistent max van beer seemed like these machine used the cheap version of a jet engine to disperse the water these machine v flair pro pixar movie 1 for the loop daddy shirt you know all of those video with trillion of view that just show thing that people tend to find satisfying watching james handle these machine hearing the noise they made seeing how they bent and squirmed that wa the exact opposite of those satisfying video great video james any thought on the sage bambino what is the cheapest i should spend to get a good coffee machine great video with not very surprising result wanting to upgrade from my chemex to something pressurised a i have a niche due for delivery in the next few week and can not stop researching what to pair with it looked at everything from sage duo temp decent espresso de1 would be saving for a while and waiting for v4 want to buy something and grow with it and not have to replace every few year due to breakdown or just wanting a better machine hopefully jameshoffmann can help with some more of these video keep up the good work p square mile new the filter blend and the geta bore is going down very nicely in the chemex at the moment interesting video it would be interesting to hear your thought on the minimum price point for a full home espresso setup grinder espresso machine and anything else important and what kit you would recommend to get reasonably tasty coffee nice shirt you are a good guy 9 37 teaser for the next video james best low budget espresso machine yeah not the next video but certainly a future one regarding the jet of steam on grouphead james talked about you can let a bit of steam through the steam wand and then on my machine i get more or le ok dispersion i have a saeco poemia at home i think in most case a gaggia classic would be the minimum for very good and consistent espresso it start at around gbp400 though i used to own one and now i have a 2 group commercial model italian coffee living the dream on that other video about machine i would bet that a budget 58mm portafilter machine probably a gaggia will win i started out with a breville infuser and i hated the thing even with a good grinder i could not get that syrupy full of flavour kind of espresso that a good machine can within 3 month i replaced it with a proper heat exchanger cheaper machine seem like a great way to start making espresso at home but it mostly end up beeing a disappointment whenever people on a budget ask me what to get i usually recommend to get the best grinder they can and make filter moka coffee it is something i wish i had done when is the loopdaddy x brewdaddy crossover happening this wa also a really nice video it is great to get info on more affordable machine for those who do not want take a leap worth hundred of pound couldnt stop laughing great video james would you recommend the sage bambino plus with a traditional basket i got my lelit anna pl41tem for around 400euros on sale when i did my research this one seemed like one of the best beginner espresso machine have you had the chance to test it out yet please ignore my random upper and lowercasing this is because i am typing english on a german keyboard on my phone ah sorry did not see your reply but wondered if you read it after your video with the anna in it wa low key happy that you did not find any big fault with it and i still like mine not yet but i really need to check some lelit stuff it seems to have become super popular in the home barista community recently the swan retro look a lot like a euros50 60 lidl silvercrest machine in a prettier case i have a lidl one and it is mediocre at best it is back in it box now consistent result with the video using a specialit grinder i am pretty sure all four bad machine were from the same factory just built to slightly different spec no way of knowing without accessing information those brand typically would not share though aside from the actual content of the video my first thought wa if your local cafe is charging gbp100 for espresso you should find a new cafe if you want espresso atvhone a a hobby try to save for at least a tuning gaggia otherwise you end up buying something which will be definitely sold in near future with a loss i have had that delonghi model for over 4 year it is a bit of a balancing act but when you are used to it quite consistent my criticism are that the steam head is pretty useless and the noise and vibration is slightly annoying the vibration also mean that if you are unwise enough to perch cup on the top they rarely stay there for long that said i am happy with it and for the price i can not fault it it is also had four year of reliable daily use i am sure that if i spent twice that money on a better espresso machine it would be quieter and would produce marginally better coffee but for me the delonghi work just fine one thing i did not mention is that there is another annoying effect of the vibration cup tend to wander a they are jiggled around on the perforated plate and need to be manually shepherded back into position while the pump is running one thing that i maybe should not have cut but is yours really inconsistent in timing from the moment you turn on the pump to water actually flowing my unit had a pretty big variance here which wa extra annoying and the shaking rattling absurd lol i have the swan machine and wanted to know how this measured up in your experience now i know i use this every day and always thought the coffee wa fine nothing amazing just fine i wondered if i needed to grind finer to slow the extraction but i figured probably not and i can not go any finer on my delonghi grinder i am saving for the breville barista express a i have heard great thing about that james hoffmann is it possible to get a proper basket for this machine with a finer grinder you will need a proper basket i think the pressurised one just seems to cause issue with backpressure or something when you grind at a proper espresso grind hi likeyour video alot i would love see a version of this video but for coffee maker it is on the list 15 20 year ago i had one of the delonghi is ancestor and though i had never heard the term specialty coffee and wa using very dark roast and an heirloom handgrinder it is nice to see my memory of it match your experience it wa noisy loud plasticy needed a few run throughs to get it all hot and even then would be temperamental but it did produce what i thought then wa decent espresso have now just been sucked back across the event horizon of the home espresso rabbit hole to mix my metaphor and gone for flair plus comandante that is what seemed to me a plausible answer to the question how affordably can i get good espresso the internet told me an aergrind might have saved me a bit of cash but i am happy with my decision so far though am on a real learning curve with all the parameter bean freshness acidity temperature pressure brew time yield all that max van beer i am delighted with it my v60s have gone from so so muddiness to shining clarity had the wilfa svart before can not go wrong with the comandante father of all high end handgrinders that is the video i am waiting for james i do not want to spend too much money but i want to experience some really good espresso at home thank you am i the only person seeing james so disappointed and stressed by testing these machine i really enjoyed it james nicely done and i want to thank the patron a well time to brew myself some filter coffee that i can sip on while watching this espresso related video watched this drinking my pour over made with a finnish filter holder older than me ha i am watching in a cafe sipping my barista made cappuccino that is not that good really i am sipping my pour over cup now oh god so relatable a much a i love the educational and informative content and find it really useful more of these i am really here for that i can not believe i just drank that expression should have gone with deja brew would have been epic used to have an earlier version of that delonghi that i managed to find in a thrift store for euros3 50 for that money it wa easy to manage expectation and it served me well through uni i do agree that the tamper is shite these day i have a barista express improving on absolutely everything the delonghi had to offer but what i want to say that a james point out you could do a lot worse than the delonghi if your budget can not stretch i still have and use the earlier version if delonghi i guess i am waiting for it to break the shaking and rattling is annoying my cup slide out from underneath the stream i wonder what james think of the whole e s e thing it offer i have been using a delonghi icona for the past couple of year it make a lovely cup tbh and is excellent at milk frothing learnt so much about coffee from having it and use it 4 5 time a day it shake rattle and roll but i have not needed anything more expensive it cost gbp40 second hand the previous owner had it for a week and put it in a cupboard it is great for getting the girl round and you get tampered with i have an inexpensive nespresso right now but it is great because i expect fuss free caffeine delivery not the espresso experience i feel like partly it is the audience after this many video i am inclined to avoid the machine in this price range because i do not want to wake up every morning and think about how this doe not feel like everything i wa fantasizing about while watching this channel i will upgrade in a couple year once i can do it right i have a delonghi and agree with you i had a barista express it wa ok for about 1 2yrs before i upgraded to the dual boiler honestly if my machine break and i am not in a position to repair or replace it i will just go to filter coffee rather than buy one of the entry level machine to get by i do not think i would enjoy using an entry level espresso machine again after using a more capable one the barista express is probably the bare minimum i would recommend a an investment into making coffee at home if you add up the cost of buying a daily coffee from a caf it far exceeds the cost of a barista express and supply over a year i bought the delonghi and a you said it is currently sat in my big food cupboard not doing anything i am sorry to disappoint but i drink my coffee through a nespresso machine which let just be honest is a really expensive why to drink it also i would like to see a video on the gbp200 bracket a well i think that is would be a good idea thanks for the good quality video waiting for the breville duo boiler review i have a gaggia cubika plus that i have modified to be non pressurised i have found it to produce excellent espresso if you get the tamp and grind spot on normal people enjoys espresso with these machine james this is krups wa tempted but fortunately you stopped me p james thanks for making this video look forward to the next series of machine maybe for the future video find out both the bare minimum for the people who just want to do a decent shot of espresso and also those who want to dig a little deeper with the hobby this the gud shiz i had a delongi machine and i frankly do not understand their existence making espresso is an already painfully difficult task and complicating it even more with such an instrument will only lead to a complete loss of interest in novice people target audience i believe acceptable coffee on such machine can only happen by accident and then i personally have never been lucky can you make a video about coffee machine that meet the minimum requirement for an acceptable espresso that would be very interesting and i look forward to continuing the series of video on dialing in espresso please i have difficulty with this i have a similar one without a pressurized basket i only use it once in a while and i get good coffee half the time i enjoy it though waited on this kind of review for a long time i began my coffee journey with delongy pressurized i found for about 40 usd second hand wa with me for a very long time and i thought i wa drinking good coffee only after tasting an amazing espresso at a friend is house and other third wave option did i understand this machine ha to go went back to a moka pot then a clever then aeropress and finally found a second hand la pavoni which i adore i use all of the above every week thanks jeff made me laugh way more than it should have james you should just make espresso with an aeropress please more of this kinda review you help u spend our money in the right place and help the plant from this awful waste can we take a moment to appreciate james is taste in music nice shirt great review really enjoyed it however i like traditional james so can you please bring back wearing the jumper summer seems like no excuse to stop wearing such fantastic jumper i live in the uk there will be jumper all year i used to own the delonghi until the dial on the front literally popped off one time during use i wa not using fresh ground at the time so i found it wa only the first few cup from some pre ground lavazza that tasted remotely like a decent coffee even now grinding still catch me out now amp then on my sage express perhaps the end of this one life i may decide to go with a separate grinder solution if you are on a budget just buy mokapot simple a that personally i almost went for a cheap espresso machine but i am much happier with the good quality filter machine moccamaster i ended up buying i feel like it is a much better option for those just looking for a consistently good cup of coffee at a similar price point i love these video please keep up the good work james lot of espressso love james face always say more about how good the coffee is than his word and that is more than enough i actually had a delonghi machine for year and it wa exactly a you said an impulse purchase that spent year in the cupboard could you do a video on the cheapest machine to get good result from i had one of the pressurized filter version and it wa just very frustrating to use and to clean edit forget about that i just watched it to the end and you just said that d use it for a week or two and in to the cupboard it go that is exactly what happened with my argo cookworks sup gbp100 machine i am back on the v60 whilst i am here can you recommend a decent burr grinder in the gbp40 80 range i lose patience with a hand burr grinder so bought the cookworks blade grinder along with the espresso machine and it is frankly not very good a 2nd hand baratza the encore would do just fine the virtuoso would be nice get a new set of burr if they seem worn out i have seen encore go for 50 euro but they are often gone pretty quickly at those price i think he already made a video on that a while back reviewing grinder so gbp100 is not enough for good espresso what about gbp200 or gbp300 i would love to see a follow up series on this go for the cafelat robot it on par with any expensive espresso machine you can get at any price there is no other machine like it quality and price wise i think i will just attach a hydraulic press and heating element to my flair definitely looking forward to the minimum entry level for pleasant coffee making experience video depends if it is espresso or not if it is pour over i am sure it would be a 10dollar pour over and a dollar50 hand grinder add a cheap scale to that and you could probably get away with like dollar65 giorgos papadopoulos p the grinder might be cheaper here but the lelit is over 600 euro and all other decent italian machine even more sigh giorgos papadopoulos agree researched grinder for some time came to conclusion that sage breville sgp is simply the best low cost grinder at the moment amazon here in australia had it for audollar180 111 euro i really did not want to like it given all the snobbish forum comment but honestly it is well designed and a bit of wdt ie stirring sort out it main issue clumping i paid approx euros500 for a decent set up lelit pl41e with a sage smart grinder pro it may be not the best grinder but one of the better one you could get for euros200 yes thank you for this okay why is the intro music so much louder than your actual voice in the video it is always like this you realize it actually hurt the ear when you have such a drastic change in volume sorry i usually try and make sure they all sit at the same level but this one slipped through so what would be a sweet spot for home espressso brewing gbp200 gbp250 more i know gaggia classic ha a cult following but it also involves a lot of mod and faffing about to get the most out of it any other sugestions i would go with more at those budget i would at least wait for james to make his minimum recommendation the problem is that consistency is what is often lacking in the cheaper machine the temperature can be all over the place resulting in very different cup when you do everything the exact same way a a result it is really difficult to learn what effect a certain change like smaller coarser grind size ha on the final result if you want nice coffee on a budget i would look more towards pour over with a plastic hario v60 a nice grinder with available part like a baratza virtuoso and a gooseneck temp controlled kettle going 2nd hand on the grinder might also be worthwhile a long a part are available you can probably find them just over half the new price a a result they might need a new plastic gear or new burr but it can save you a lot of money if you are willing to learn how to fix them if you do really want espresso then it depends whether you need milk a dual boiler are way nicer for steaming or not and how long you want it to last i recently found a second hand expobar brewtus 4 pid that wa basically new and it work great i did consider going with a breville sage dual boiler but like most machine made with that much plastic part it doe tend to fail after a couple of year from what i wa able to gather at the home barista com forum lot of info there really worth reading through some of it you can expect it to last at least 3 year maybe 5 after that it will probably die and you will not really be able to fix it from what i could tell while expobar part seem to not be a readily available a some more luxurious brand like ecm profitec or lelit it wa good enough for me and at 800 euro i thought it wa worth it i hope it will last for a long while and i will just fix it myself i really prefer the idea of just getting something that can last several decade over getting another piece of plastic that i will have to throw out when the first few part break if i had to buy a new one now i would look at something like a profitec pro 300 lelit elizabeth if you want milk or an ecm classika pid if you only need 1 boiler alternatively maybe something like a cafelat robot would be an option le than half the price i would get the barista version with the pressure gauge at 370 dollar or 425 euro depending on where you live and it will probably outlast any of machine i mentioned above a there is very little to go wrong i want to know what is the lowest priced machine that you would recommend love your work the machine itself is also oof james hoffmann 2020 used gaggia classic is like gbp100 7 15 water park ha opened short answer no long answer noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i am canceling my machine order just to wait and hear your thought on the minimum machine to buy for a good good espresso cheer james jimmy spendix spent a few year temp surfing with a silvia it is honestly not much of a complication to your workflow especially compared to preheating a flair with a cheap pid install you can completely eliminate the need for it if you get a decent controller like a ito lev you can unlock a bunch of other capability too james prankard i think any of the bottom end gaggias used are fine i believe they all have the same boiler and group head some do not have a solenoid i have had a remanufactured gaggia baby class and i am using a used gaggia colour now of course i had to fix the portafilter holder on the colour because they have a stupid plastic piece that hold in the portafilter that will always wear down but it work well enough now get a used gaggia or silvia al va i have a gaggia classic pro and a baratza sette 30 grinder i get awesome espresso out of it and the gaggia us a standard portafilter and filter basket j p i agree my research wa ownership of a silvia for 12 year before upgrading to a lelit pl62 hx machine potential next video idea can you get good espresso for under gbp300 carolyn copeland still happy with this machine i have been looking at it here in u it ha a different name and different brand in the uk too but the version with the inbuilt grinder look very similar to the more expensive breville sage barista express s bastien pepinster i can vouch for this too i had one it could not make coffee i sent it back waste of time stef bellelli why you can buy single origin coffee ground in front of you and you would go through that bag in a week anyway so it stay fresh we considered a cheaper espresso maker but in the end opted to wait and save feeling we made the right decision yes i would like to see a series like this for under 300euros dejabrew i love it no way that shirt lt 3 i got one from aldi a waste of money so will you do a review of an affordable espresso maker that is worth buying ie not a waste of hard earned cash if it is too expensive it is too expensive but better to do without rather than buy something cheaper that is rubbish ohhhhh deja breeeeww the krups ha the same portafilter a the gbp50 sainsbury is espresso machine same tamper scoop thing too needle to say i ditched that machine for my trusty aeropress that i now brew with everyday d j brew is i hate myself with my sage barista express i do not use the built in grinder i use the sage grinder that you can get and weigh out the coffee for a single shot to keep it fresh if i have very expensive coffee bean i would bag them up with 18g of coffee in them and vacuum seal them and only use one once a week i have also brought an extra porto filter with it so i can make two coffee at a faster time i have also brought an extra milk jug too what is the name of the grinder james hoffmann thanks the niche zero niche zero yes dollar100 espresso machine and god know how much grinder i believe it to be gbp500 i doubt anyone would spend that on a grinder then gbp60 on the espresso machine i think it is around gbp400 i wa just thinking of getting an affordable espresso machine thank you for this tulilasalome got one already again a james stated in the video your grinder is so important a gaggia can make good coffee if you have a good grinder get a mocapot dorian i have seen that in the comment it is pretty pricey brand new but ima look it up more thx get a second hand gaggia classic hanna to think i wa about to buy the amazonbasics machine haha why doe james always upload during my online school test why not just had a stats exam a well he is actually your professor in disguise love the marc rebillet shirt i had to go way too far down in the comment to find this lol 1 for real proud of you james lol wa so happy to see this saw him in chicago wa great make me happy to know hoffman is a fan too how did i miss that also imagine seeing james hoffman at a marc rebillet gig that would mean that anything is possible let is give a quick shoutout to marc rebillet me before watching the video and recently got a delonghi espresso machine nervously sweating edit i am glad the best one out of these wa delonghi i do not actually have that exact model and mine wa a bit more expensive a a beginner to coffee i enjoy my first machine lol jon massey ordered cheer wilfried reichardt the motor problem had to be either an isolated problem or i am very lucky i have ec685 for around 3 year and it keep working just fine even under a load that i would imagine is a tad more heavy than initially intended leoniden no i use ecp3531 i guess it an older one like i said im pretty new to espresso for that i can say it is pretty easy and doe it job well the portafilter is quite different than the one in the video it not fully automatic btw jon massey can you link me to the portafilter and basket please i have got the same machine thinking of upgrading soom but this may be a good fix in the mid term i am also located near bristol and find the hard water seems to mess with thing let me know if you find any good fix to that love the marc rebillet shirt rep n that loop daddy the world is not ready for that crossover he got 2 awesome point on my list because of the tee please keep producing amazing coffee video that force me to watch them all great video james but i will ask i am interested if you could please do a video all about metal coffee filter grind setting and brew technique for metal filter a well love your vids james big fan here james hoffmann thanks james it is on the list worth getting rid of a bean to cup machine for one of these with a hand grinder i have a porlex mini at the moment hand grinder are not great a cheap burr grinder would probably be better imo no i have a similar machine with a hand grinder and it is often a struggle i have tried many coffee with it only really worked with one most of my shot ended up being sour or just not coming through if i adjusted the grind size home espresso is such a never ending rabbit hole i love that i am into it but would not recommend it to normal people and when they ask me what to buy i always tell them decent grinder like encore virtuoso aeropress v60 they then say but i want to drink espresso to which i answer go to the cafe really i would say that if you like the idea of a new hobby go for it if you just want espresso in the morning and do not want too much to think about a lelit marax might be the answer if that is still too much to worry about it is probably better to go a cafe indeed i do not think it is a rabbit hole my parent who just want to drink coffee have had a breville sage machine and grinder for a good 8 year and are onto their second one now after it died last year they bought the same one again because it work fine for their need plenty of other people run them and do not get caught up in it all i thought if i buy an espresso machine i would save moey in the long run by not going to the cafe i bought a hobby and i am definitely not off cheaper oh well i like it now these are the question i want to know the answer too how cheap can i be dan larwood gotcha mr ruck is in japan so there may be better option there for the price i see people selling used rok or robot with some regularity around dollar150 in usa and used premium hand grinder picked up a lido e myself in the dollar150 range edit definitely should have specified used on my end get a sage barista express patrick wilson that is about gbp500 though barista version of the robot imported to uk is gbp300 ish and commandante is gbp190 at best  could always go manual a rok or a cafelat robot paired with a comandante c40 or kinu m47 phoenix can make excellent espresso if you have the patience thank you i drink tea darling tom holland hello love your vids man 1st in lol hi from new zealand lot of love to you all im early

15,Delonghi Stilosa Espresso Machine ec260bk How To Use | Unboxing | Review,most people who have this machine do seem happy with it to take it up a notch i would advise grinding your own coffee rather than using pre ground although once you start down the journey be warned that you might start spending more to get the next step of improvement like all thing you soon get into diminishing return great video thanks thank you for the demonstration too many ums though it is distracting but i do appreciate your video on this machine thanks i will work on my ums in the future how long did it take until your water heat up and started pouring out sorry for the late response i have learned that if the portafilter is not completely locked into place it will not brew properly it take at least a few minute for it to heat up and brew i hope this help hi do you like it after 2 month yes
