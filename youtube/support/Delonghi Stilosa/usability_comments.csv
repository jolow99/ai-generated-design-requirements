119,there are either 2 problem why this is occurring the grind of the coffee is not fine enough or the machine doe not use enough pressure to expel the coffee i am not sure if you grind your own bean but you have to make sure whether you do it yourself or have a barista do it for you that it is a fine grind it should be like fine sand if it is not fine enough then it will come out watery and sour and also i forgot to mention but another thing could be that the coffee bean you are using are too much of a light roast lighter roast are usually not a strong a darker one and are used for drip coffee or french press so if you are using a lighter roast i would suggest trying a darker one and finally the machine may have a pressure problem because if you notice it drip slower when brewing then the machine probably doe not expel enough pressure to be consistent i would try troubleshooting it from their customer service or maybe get a replacement if your machine is noticeably broken sorry if this is too long i am just a barista bored at 11pm,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.4957360625267029, 0.4357038140296936, 0.06856007874011993]"

200,mrmarki134 you nailed the exact issue with rancilios they are dumb tank they are heavy duty but to a fault just like every industry technology improves most people expect their machine to last 3 5 year and then they will upgrade even with the heavy duty material ranchilios inners are subject to same set of issue of calcium build up rubber seal aging etc even with proper maintenance many component do not out last other machine by a meaningful and useful way i think your argument about build quality is mostly centered around the concept of using metal versus plastic in that regard plastic technology improves and you can see breville is good at adapting those new technology to improve durability and touch feel of their product in that regard phillips also do a good job at it are breville perfect is every sense no but they are pretty darn close a you spend more time making coffee and get to know all the little nuance about the process i think you will appreciate breville more most of u have gone through the same process path,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.47265809774398804, 0.26778122782707214, 0.2595606744289398]"
201,w that is quite a good reasoning i completely agree with your point on delonghi and gaggia it kind of pain me to see that a once great company that made awesome machine now make cheap pressurized machine superautomatics and one good machine that is kinda pricy rancilio is machine i like more bc i think i would prefer le feature and more solid build i do not have a machine and i am sure i would love an infuser but i have heard that while they are very convenient they are not tank made to last year and year but who know i am kind of a noob and breville is also a bit young a a company maybe some machine will last a lifetime,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.46985527873039246, 0.4340512454509735, 0.09609343856573105]"
202,mrmarki134 i disagree rancilio make trim down commercial like machine for home use they are basically feature and convenience stripped their only claim to fame is the the heavy duty of the material used but their design lack finesse if you look at the price point for a simple silvia you can get heck a lot more feature under breville brand i find breville be very reliable and if they fail it is likely because of user error or improper maintenance and of course because their machine are way more sophisticated than rancilio and have more moving part gaggia is owned by philip saeco and have long merged product line and is known for superautomatics their manual product line like the classic were designed prior to the merger and have a lot of quality issue for a rather simple machine if you balance out feature modern day convenience quality and price point breville brand seems to always hit the perfect balance so much so others are copying their design just so you know i own quite a few delonghi everyone of them have very notable design flaw poor design choice tradeoff and reliability issue but because they have such a strong retail presence so it is hard to ignore when you are dealing with a sea of product i now basically have a rule that we will not buy any more delonghi brand product at my home and a well a workplace,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.45958206057548523, 0.4293555021286011, 0.11106248944997787]"

296,i just got this machine to replace an ec155 that finally broke after eight year there are numerous difference 1 the filter click into the portafilter and no longer need a lever on the handle to stop the filter from falling out when you try to tap out the coffee ground 2 the 2 shot filter is actually big enough for 2 shot the ec155 two shot filter is way too small 3 you can see the water tank water level much easier 4 the water tank actually hold more water but only by a little 5 the frother is controlled by a lever on the right instead of a knob on the top freeing up top space for warming cup and is faster to operate 6 more space under portafilter to accommodate taller cup 7 doe not have a built in tamper 8 frother is on the right side 9 frother nozzle seems much easier to clean making it more sanitary 10 ha a slightly large footprint 11 doe not vibrate a much you no longer need to hold the espresso cup in place during extraction all in all the stilosa is better in every way except for the frother being on the right side i would not buy a ec155 again,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7591670155525208, 0.1439879983663559, 0.09684500098228455]"
297,i think the biggest difference i noticed wa the steam wand the ec155 ha a panerello might have spelled that wrong which is built to be easy to use and help if you just want hot foamy milk but not great if you want to play around with milk texture but this newer model appears to have a manual which is good if you do also i do not remember the exact size but i think the newer model ha a smaller water tank but yeah honestly they are both pretty similar i feel like there must be some internal change for it to have a totally different name since on the outside it is so similar apart from the wand another thing is if you want to get into modifying or upgrading the machine with different part if you need to replace something or get it serviced the ec155 is definitely the better pick,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.809441089630127, 0.11010683327913284, 0.08045215159654617]"

324,foxotic the assumption is that when people buy a machine at this price point they do not wish to spend their time learning how to steam their milk properly so they add the metal guard which leaf load of room between the milk and where the steam exit the rubber tip to inject air into the milk a you said you end up with wayyy more bubble and too much froth reality you want a little gap a possible so you can control how much air you add etc for most people buying this machine they see the bubble and the foam and they are happy whereas we see it and want it done properly hence why we take off the metal bit,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5670303106307983, 0.29277780652046204, 0.14019182324409485]"

352,homebaristant i just got a similar setup and wa trying to dial it in today my breville grinder wa at 8 today and still wa way too fast that is interesting you use a light roast of dark roast i wa probably getting close to 50g of liquid in 15 second i am wondering if perhaps the liquid is bypassing the puck on the outside because it is too fine,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7271863222122192, 0.18238253891468048, 0.09043107181787491]"
353,in the video i believe it wa set at 15 but depending on the bean it can range anywhere between 15 9 i have not gone finer since this machine end up choking past 9 but crema is typically associated with how fresh your bean are so the fresher your bean the more crema you should produce i recommend using fresh bean that are one to two week past it original roast date you do not want it to be too fresh oddly enough and you do not want it too stale old which might be your case,"['video', 'not usability', 'usability']","[0.9168140888214111, 0.042760755866765976, 0.040425170212984085]"
354,i am thinking about picking up a delonghi stilosa myself since my budget is pretty low i will be using lavazza pre ground to make my espresso shot what is the purpose of getting the bottomless portafilter rather than just using the portafilter that come with the machine also what is the purpose of the distribution tool,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6664838194847107, 0.20159873366355896, 0.13191741704940796]"

356,the portafilter that come with the machine is a pressurized portafilter this mean that your grind quality will not really matter and will pretty much make something similar to crema but not quite the bottomless portafilter is not necessary but it is a regular unpressurized portafilter meaning your grind quality will most definitely matter the bottomless just allows you to see what is going on during extraction you can always depressurize the original portafilter but then you would not want to use preground,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.3993346393108368, 0.39828357100486755, 0.2023816704750061]"

624,james i have only just found your channel but really enjoy it already your video on how to make proper frothed milk ha improved my froth overnight however i must tell you that 99percent of average people will be buying precisely these machine if they are at all interested in better coffee very few people will ever dream of spending more than gbp100 on a coffee machine even 100 seems too expensive i discovered great coffee on an italian holiday and when back home bought a mokka pot to try and emulate that compared to instant coffee it wa light year better and it only cost gbp5 after a few year i saw a delonghi espresso machine and it looked so pretty i bought a refurbished one that lasted me about 3 4 year and wa another step up from the mokka pot i make exclusively cappuccino it produced the same result a the delonghi in this video i assumed this wa the pinnacle of coffee making when it packed up i bought another gbp100 delonghi which packed up last week after 5 6 year of use not having seen your video i replaced it with what i could afford a euros100 sencor espresso machine just because i wa tired of the noise and incessant dripping of the delonghi like most people i simply do not have euros500 to spend on a coffee machine or euros100 on a grinder gbp30 for the grinder which is actually a nut grinder i say all this to help you realise that most likely 99percent of your subscriber are like me so please keep that in mind when making your video i do wish manufacturer would give u real espresso machine for euros100 since that is alot of money just to make coffee and it is downright terrible of them to offer a sub par experience to an unwitting public who think they are now getting coffee shop quality at home,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.6079097390174866, 0.2935800850391388, 0.09851019829511642]"

694,do you have a video that show the cheapest machine you would use and that is show why you like it the only think i got out of this video wa at 3 34 in the video you said it come with a proper basket when your looking a basket how do you know what a proper basket look like from the others do you have a video that you go over what is needed to make the espresso a video for people that are new to this in this video you keep going over thing that wa not good but you did not say what wa needed you said at 4 08 there wa no gauge if there wa a gauge what would you want to see the pressure or the temp of the water or both is the amount of pressure the water is being pressed out into the basket important if so what psi do you want i have a steamer and it ha a pressure regulator switch in it i can turn the adjustable screw on the top of the switch to set the pressure of steam that come out there is a pipe that go from the tank to a pressure gauge so it not a big deal to add a pressure gauge and a adjustable pressure switch when the pressure i set is reached it shuts off the power to the heater that go around tank i guess when i am controlling the pressure in the tank i am controlling the temp of the water so i guess what i would like to know is what is more important in making good espresso the pressure it coming out or the temp of the water or both what is the magic pressure or temp wanted at 9 03 you said the delonghi doe not have a pressurized portafilter but you did not say what system the delonghu us what should we be looking for do a you have a link to the bare minimum espresso video your were talking about making,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8772870898246765, 0.07101430743932724, 0.051698535680770874]"

1038,i had a delonghi ec155m i believe that it is about identical to the ec146b it certainly doe look it except for more metal in the body i got one new on clearance for about 80cad nearly two year ago a friend who know espresso better said it is ok on it own right and for half the regular price a must buy if you are on a budget i mean i understand where the whole enjoying it and hobby thing for coffee but i am of a long time coffee drinking culture it doe not have to be a hobby to enjoy the end result i find this delonghi to be the absolute best you can buy in this range bar none i get that you are running on a budget level that most people just do not have i enjoy your video and have tried to do what i can with what i have got to match but you honestly make it sound like unless you are in the top 10percent of income earner you can not enjoy ok to good espresso at home and i am not a fan of the inference spending 400 dollar on a machine is considered expensive even if good quality machine run into the thousand with the little ec155m i have converted so many friend from drip onto espresso and i think that speaks volume and really earns it the title of best only decent entry priced machine and hobbyist exist outside of the top 10percent earner and you do what you can with what you have got half a year ago i upgraded to a delonghi ec860 used for 200cad i like the automatic option it had a pid default is a pressurized basket but you have compatible basket you can buy for cheap the portafilter is solid metal save for the handle and ha a decent weight to it i think that it doe just fine one day i will upgrade to something prosumer and likely away from delonghi certainly something with a better steam wand design although it steam well enough and quickly i use a bodum burr grinder 100 cad yes i spent more on the grinder than my first espresso machine it grind really well for the price review i have seen give it a 7 10 for grind consistency i try to buy better quality coffee and keep it fresh i sincerely feel like i get 80percent of the quality for 20percent of the price even if i had to go to brand new the sage breville bambino wa recently 350 cad on year end sale currently 380cad,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.5115423798561096, 0.39068883657455444, 0.09776881337165833]"

1195,my experience with non pressurized basket is that these machine have simply too much pressure for a normal basket high pressure and a pinhole is the formula for constant flow rate regardless of what you put in the basket it seems to me that slowing the flow with actual coffee mean a grind so fine that you are on a knife edge between flow and blockage and for me that meant i definitely got better coffee but it wa very inconsistent my grinder is not great so i can see how a better grinder would improve thing but i am thinking that even with a good grinder you are fighting against the law of physic it seems a pity they can not add a low pressure switch i can not seem to shake my skepticism that decent machine must be expensive,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.5958408117294312, 0.3627197742462158, 0.04143939167261124]"

1241,at this price level a used saeco barista is worthwhile if you can find one for under dollar100 one particular note though a james alluded to you have to understand that if you buy a used saeco barista it is a modified portafilter which cheapens the true draw and make it taste terrible you have to strip the portafilter down to make it a real portafilter take 10 minute at most now you can make true espresso but the beauty is the machine is a well built machine for the money nothing really anywhere close on the market for dollar100 for sure these machine are built in italy and use some fine heavy duty rust free casing many many time the original purchaser have bought the unit and have no clue how to use them or got them a a gift and hardly used them usually in very good condition they work well for the price and can teach you why buying a good grinder is more important if you are going to get into buying a real espresso machine the saeco barista will either make you want to never make daily espresso again and leave that for someone else or you will be challenged and intrigued and want to buy an even better machine and get into the fine art of making better espresso at home the way pro and enthusiast do and it is not snobbery because think of how many other hobby and interest people have that make you want to tune them out gardening bird watching cooking detail car engine painting baking wine high end bourbon and disitlled product etc,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6410091519355774, 0.22490841150283813, 0.1340823769569397]"

1285,thats a great video and sadly i am inclined to agree that you can not get a good espresso from sub 100 machine a cheaper thermobloc machine with a depressurized portafilter and an ok grinder could get decent result it might not be a enjoyable a better machine a so many variable will be wildly fluctuating i started with a 80 euro 2nd hand saeco via venezia although a depressurized portafilter did exist for it mine sadly did not came with one i tried to mod it wrecking the portafilter in the progress and thought i could get away with preground fine supermarket coffee that wa a disaster these machine with the exception of the one with a normal portafilter will make you an espresso inspired drink especially if you froth milk it will be okish my general advice if you do not have money for a decent espresso machine which many aboout 10 year ago considered rancillio silvia to be a solid entry level machine try to see if you can get an e61 hx machine 2nd hand a second hand grinder or just forget about espresso and make good coffee by using a decent grinder and nice moka pot james hoffman i do wonder with what gear you started out with,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8218582272529602, 0.09845735877752304, 0.07968443632125854]"

1371,i picked up a rather ancient salton ex80 espresso machine at a garage sale the other day for dollar5 it had never been used and came with 4 small shot cup 4 larger shot mug plate creamer and small spoon i think it wa manufactured in 1996 really loud when you use the milk frother for cappucino would definitely wake the neighbor downstairs i am not really an espresso person choosing to make my coffee one cup at a time using a manual pour over melitta basket and 2 cone filter i use a cheap dollar20 electric kettle that delivers a nice creama but it stay in the paper filter and not the cup so my first cup wa a mess i did not have the coffee holder completely seated so coffee and steam sprayed out the side next attempt went smoothly using simple preground medium grind coffee however when i got some actual espresso ground coffee at home good only half of the water got through the ground really got packed in so i think the fine grind is not correct for this machine funny the small tin of coffee cost dollar6 more than what i paid for the whole machine i am having le success with the milk frothing i had to bend the frother tube out a bit to fit my cup and be able to move the tube around the cup this step is where the machine get really noisy it is nice having the milk warmed up but a for the frothing it really doe not seem to do anything my half and half doe without all the noise,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.49563777446746826, 0.42625293135643005, 0.07810933142900467]"

1452,i have a delonigi that look very slimier but ha a pressure portafilter it wa given to me a a christmas present i bought a cheap hand grinder that is not particularly good and i buy my coffee from a local roaster i normally make an americano with it and occasionally a latte i do not have experience of using better quality equipment so am not used to the taste that they would provide however before having it i would buy my coffee from starbucks on my way to work or uni i feel that the coffee it produce is light year better than what i used to get from starbucks and i use in almost every day instead of going to starbucks so it is a lot cheaper in the long run plus i get to choose different bean each time i buy more coffee and i really enjoy trying the different flavour they produce so for me an entry level machine doe the job even if it not perfect and i would recommend to anyone who buy an americano every day that is also happy to get up 5 minute early to make their coffee although not one that dig a hole in the ground coffee in the portafilter a that would probably make undrinkable coffee judging by jame is reaction it is also proven to myself that i would happily make my own coffee everyday so now i know when i have the money to buy a better machine and a good grinder i know they will not just be expensive kitchen ornament,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.620949387550354, 0.22726327180862427, 0.1517873853445053]"

1710,ucxduihato yeah i wa more agreeing and adding to your comment not saying you got anything wrong i think there is also another factor with someone not very well off when something get too expensive you are thinking more about the price than enjoying yourself i think that would be the case with me if i wa drinking something like wine that cost 5 10x what i usually pay i would be thinking too much about how much i can not afford it i think this can even be a little true if someone buy it for you it is the same with say driving an expensive car or using expensive sport equipment you can worry so much about not wanting to ruin it that you forget to enjoy yourself anyway yes to go back to the original point whilst it true that sometimes in blind taste testing there can be surprise i think it also a shame that so many here do not seem to think there are any difference in quality at all you have also got to design the right test of course sometimes something of high quality can only really be told apart when you are having it over a reasonably long period of time rather than from a quick sip let is say i had to distinguish music by beethoven from some amateur composer listening to only 10 second it could possibly be tough listening for 10 minute it would be very easy unless it wa a fantastic amateur i think the same can be generally true in wine and food although i think with coffee and spirit you can often tell straight away if somethings no good,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5908284783363342, 0.27768340706825256, 0.1314881443977356]"
1711,ken cur i think one thing though is that with some drink mentioned here spending more doe not necessarily give you nicer because nicer is subjective i think with say whisky spending more give you more complexity and interesting flavour and spending very little can give you some horribly rough and nasty drink but someone favourite drink can easily be the gbp25 30 whisky rather than the gbp60 100 one with other spirit like vodka or gin i find that spending more simply get you a more refined drink that is easier to swallow and more subtle but often spending 4x the money will not get you something that allows you to enjoy your drink 4x more with wine i do not know i do not have enough experience i only ever buy mid to low priced wine and the few time i had better wine it wa nice but not nice enough to justify the cost cheap wine can be horrible but in some country like italy it can also be really very good and by good of course i mean i enjoy it because some people may not and with coffee i agree there are diminishing return and honestly i like a lot of variation in my coffee so i do not care so much about getting everything just right but i agree that sometimes if you get something really crap it is not worth it you might a well get coffee done in an easier way than a cheap and no good espresso it is like people who take a delicious steak and cook it to within an inch of it life fine if you like it that way but why not just have a burger or something in the first place i do not see the point really,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5175612568855286, 0.3833099901676178, 0.09912876039743423]"

1847,i have a version of the swan almost identical but it ha a different brand slapped on it it is alright i do not drink straight espresso usually a milky whatever and it is perfectly drinkable coffee i can say the steamer is lacklustre it is difficult to make nice even frothy milk and you get a lot of bigger bubble but it is better than the drip machine that i had before and it make coffee well enough that the bigger variable is the actual coffee i use another thing to note i found that it make a better cup if you hit go immediately when the ready light come on if you leave it a minute or so after it is ready you can end up with an almost cigarette like flavour even though it say the temperature ha not changed we also have the de longhi at work and it is just a much better steamer it doe really good frothy milk imo however i have found that it is much le consistent than the swan in the actual coffee it produce and the attached tamper is absolute dogshit why they thought that wa a good idea is beyond me if you try to make 2 cup at once you have to clean off the tamper first or you get a nice layer of grit from the godawful vibration the damn thing practically dance across the table but we got it for free and it trump instant,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7312277555465698, 0.1501639038324356, 0.11860834062099457]"

2390,i have been on a very brief journey of coffee machine purchasing i started first of all with the delonghi bc065bs no pump just steam pressurised it worked but it wa utter garbage i used it for two week and it ended up being the work filter coffee machine i then bought a proper pump machine the magimix l expresso which at the time i wa very pleased with it made what i thought wa good coffee and i used it for a good few year at this point my interest and a little spare cash coincided and i decided it wa time to upgrade there wa a lot of researching balancing on what i could afford against bang for buck i wanted the rancillo silvia but if i bought that i could not afford a grinder so i settled and for the last 8 year i have been using an iberital mc2 grinder and an original gaggia classic no pressurised basket the gaggia ha had one failed part the switch flew across the room one day scaring the life out of me and a few upgrade brass shower head plate better shower screen and a pid thermostat the iberital choked on a stone hidden in some bean and needed a new gear but that is all i have done i am still happy with my coffee someone is probably laughing at me right now thinking i have not really had a good coffee,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6567537784576416, 0.2416275590658188, 0.10161863267421722]"

2466,hi james my first and unfortunately still current machine is the delonghi ecp33 21 that i bought for exactly gbp100 a few year ago terrible choice yes but i did not know what i wa getting into so i wanted to learn the basic skill instead of going head first and grab the best equipment of course the first thing i immediately realised after the purchase wa how hard it is to get the grind consistency i want using a blade grinder so i bought an entry level grinder called graef cm702 for another gbp100 soon after i also found a gbp8 non pressurized basket that fit the 51mm portafilter although i needed to unscrew the plastic inside after that i finally had some satisfaction pulling good shot unassisted by the pressurised basket but it did not take long before the inconsistency of the tool started to become a wall and i never found the reason nor courage to explore beyond the lavazzas and sicals of espresso bean because the shot i wa pulling were too inconsistent i would probably waste about 40percent of the bag just from bad shot and adjustment dial in do not seem to be relevant for very long and the constant troubleshooting process becomes exhausting after a while it is funny that i am most passionate about espresso but always found simpler happier experience with pourovers and french press my first brew wa the floral fruity fresh panama boquete via a v60 which note i still reminisce up to this day so i am looking forward to your next buyer is guide video especially at the gbp300 gbp400 range one of the machine upgrade i have been eyeing for a deal on for a long time is the lelit anna pl41lem pl41tem boiler conventional steam wand never quite liked the cappucino modern style frother the end froth seems to be too airy and especially the one that came with my machine is a pain in the arse to clean you have to take it apart and scrub them everytime because the milk get stuck in weird corner and the wall in the frother even after you flushed it sexy lever switch clean look comfortably sized pid for the tem variant and seems like a robust little machine go for euros430 but stock seems to not always be available p s if you have actually read this i might a well go ahead and get a few question in 1 thermoblock v boiler is it really worth the price difference i found a dual thermoblock machine that go for around gbp550 just above the pricepoint for entry level boiler machine with no immediately obvious shortcoming and wa wondering if the convenience and price outweighs the difference in feature and quality anyway 2 are those built in grinder in espresso machine actually any good is the difference in grind quality worth the space saving and the price 3 am i crazy or bean from the same bag really do need grind adjustment a they lose freshness i already suspect my 40 grind setting too cheap to be true grinder but it seems to work great for a few day then need a step up or two to get the same grind profile i am conflicted on whether it is something i have to be personally mindful of or is it time for an upgrade 4 what do you think about the moisture buildup for frozen bean i find that moisture build up even after double bagging my bean with zipbags,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.42781487107276917, 0.3716549575328827, 0.20053015649318695]"

3151,not likely a common opinion but i wa a bit disappointed with this video you can get some cheap replacement unpressurised basket and 3rd party tamper it seems a bit unfair to judge these machine purely on these replaceable accessory in a pinch while waiting for a cheap unpressurised basket for a cheap machine to arrive i have even resorted to roughly using a hacksaw to open the hole a fair bit larger so it played a much lesser role in extraction pressure i have tried using vitamin container a adlib tamper it is not hard to be better then those plastic scoop style tamper i think if you are answering the question on whether you can do this for say under 100 pound one it is unsatifying to stick to only what is in the box of the machine a 60 pound machine surely ha enough left over for a generic basket if it is a standard size,"['not usability', 'video', 'usability']","[0.6216457486152649, 0.2594553232192993, 0.11889886111021042]"

3467,i have had that delonghi model for over 4 year it is a bit of a balancing act but when you are used to it quite consistent my criticism are that the steam head is pretty useless and the noise and vibration is slightly annoying the vibration also mean that if you are unwise enough to perch cup on the top they rarely stay there for long that said i am happy with it and for the price i can not fault it it is also had four year of reliable daily use i am sure that if i spent twice that money on a better espresso machine it would be quieter and would produce marginally better coffee but for me the delonghi work just fine,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.8598185777664185, 0.08025204390287399, 0.05992940440773964]"

3533,i would go with more at those budget i would at least wait for james to make his minimum recommendation the problem is that consistency is what is often lacking in the cheaper machine the temperature can be all over the place resulting in very different cup when you do everything the exact same way a a result it is really difficult to learn what effect a certain change like smaller coarser grind size ha on the final result if you want nice coffee on a budget i would look more towards pour over with a plastic hario v60 a nice grinder with available part like a baratza virtuoso and a gooseneck temp controlled kettle going 2nd hand on the grinder might also be worthwhile a long a part are available you can probably find them just over half the new price a a result they might need a new plastic gear or new burr but it can save you a lot of money if you are willing to learn how to fix them if you do really want espresso then it depends whether you need milk a dual boiler are way nicer for steaming or not and how long you want it to last i recently found a second hand expobar brewtus 4 pid that wa basically new and it work great i did consider going with a breville sage dual boiler but like most machine made with that much plastic part it doe tend to fail after a couple of year from what i wa able to gather at the home barista com forum lot of info there really worth reading through some of it you can expect it to last at least 3 year maybe 5 after that it will probably die and you will not really be able to fix it from what i could tell while expobar part seem to not be a readily available a some more luxurious brand like ecm profitec or lelit it wa good enough for me and at 800 euro i thought it wa worth it i hope it will last for a long while and i will just fix it myself i really prefer the idea of just getting something that can last several decade over getting another piece of plastic that i will have to throw out when the first few part break if i had to buy a new one now i would look at something like a profitec pro 300 lelit elizabeth if you want milk or an ecm classika pid if you only need 1 boiler alternatively maybe something like a cafelat robot would be an option le than half the price i would get the barista version with the pressure gauge at 370 dollar or 425 euro depending on where you live and it will probably outlast any of machine i mentioned above a there is very little to go wrong,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.574272632598877, 0.27834346890449524, 0.1473838835954666]"
