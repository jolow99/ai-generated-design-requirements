93,very good question the eletta is my personal favourite between the two a it seems to be capable of reaching a finer grind size for stronger espresso shot this is especially useful for milk based drink or straight espresso the dinamica machine have better tasting long coffee and also have a very well executed iced coffee function some of the newer dinamica machine the dinamica lattecrema and dinamica plus have better programability for user presets and advanced milk drink customization in the end it is up to personal preference liam,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7464682459831238, 0.14072321355342865, 0.11280854046344757]"

142,hey bw thanks for the question for best espresso flavor we always suggest setting super automatic machine grinder to their finest setting if the finest setting should cause the machine not to brew you can always set it a little coarser but not brewing at finest setting is rare when adjusting to a finer grind setting the grinder should be running when making the adjustment that is not possible on all machine a some have safety mechanism which prevent the grinder from operating whne been hopper door are open if that is the case for you only adjust 1 click in between each grinding can not compare flow rate of super auto machine to those of semi auto machine the brewing chamber in super auto is much different in geometry than the filter basket of semi auto machine beyond that coffee dos tend to be a lot smaller hope that help,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6282272338867188, 0.2376105934381485, 0.13416217267513275]"

149,hey jennifer you are welcome for the video here is a link to side by side spec comparison of the babila and eletta if i were choosing i would go with the babila it is a more durable build with a metal skin on the case front and top it ha 2 boiler so it is faster when making milk drink it ha more clearance under the spout for taller cup like travel mug my favorite feature is the flow control dial on the babila is spout it allows one to fine tune flavor by speeding up an extraction for larger coffee and slowing it down for espresso i like the babila milk carafe which doe a quick automatic steam cleaning through the frothing component when you push the milk dispensing spout over the steam go through the carafe handle and into the drip tray so there is no mess after that the carafe go back in the fridge ready for next use it also ha a manual steam wand so you can froth to latte art quality if desired in case you missed it here is my video review of the babila it includes a look at the gaggia accademia which is a very similar machine hope that help marc,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8459830284118652, 0.13840913772583008, 0.01560783851891756]"

210,hey stefan i got this machine about a month ago and had similar question about it in the beginning keep in mind the espresso shot it produce are single not double and the single shot is approx 7g of ground coffee it may taste weak to you if you are used to the double shot that most coffee shop make or maybe you yourself have been previous to getting the eletta upping the coffee taste to extra strong will definitely give you a bolder taste i found that this machine start to make optimal shot after about a week to 10 day of daily use i have about 4 6 shot worth of espresso in various drink daily i found all the coffee it make are near perfect in taste except the flat white which i found a bit weak a it us a single shot i make flat white a a double ristretto and adding milk from the middle setting on the frother manually that make a solid flat white the grinder ha 13 setting in total look for the numberless notch between the number you can dial it in to each notch a needed i also found the espresso wa initially extracting in about 10 second and wa definitely a bit watery after playing around with the grinder setting and running through 15 20 test shot i got it to extracting in about 16 18 second and with much better crema and amber colored flow any longer and the shot were definitely over extracted and too bitter sixteen to 18 second seems to be the sweet spot also have you tested your local water and set the machine to the correct hardness level and are you using filtered water i found a huge difference in taste between unfiltered and filtered water with my local water supply,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6072599291801453, 0.22000078856945038, 0.17273926734924316]"

259,hello this probably the best review for this machine on youtube and it made me purchase the eletta since it had so many feature and make many kind of drink with one touch however i receive it last week and i feel i got a faulty machine the one touch for cappuccino and latte macchiato is making the same exact coffee size and foam even if i set the froth dial at the middle position for latte macchiato i still get the same size foam and flavor i am aware that you can customize the quantity of milk and coffee but that defeat it purpose for being a fully automatic with presets another issue is that when making flat white or caffelatte the machine will overflow my largest cup which is about 400 ml also the froth foam for flat white is twice larger than a cappuccino foam even if i set the dial to the middle position btw i did the reset twice from the menu but still same issue however all other drink like espresso double espresso and long coffee are working fine do you think i should get a replacement since i still got 3 week left of the return window thank you,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.3880542814731598, 0.388017863035202, 0.223927840590477]"

268,hi jodi apology for the delayed response thank you for the comment and question well you are doing all the thing to get a hotter drink for higher milk temp you could try using an using an airier froth setting on the carafe dial it change froth density but put milk in contact with steam longer so it get warmer a couple other idea warm the milk for 10 second prior to adding to carafe bottom line is the machine are designed to heat milk into the goldilocks zone of temperature for most apparent sweetness which is around 140f if you go to a specialty cafe not the chain that is what you will get from a properly trained barista can not tell you how many chain shop heat milk far too much i know some people want it hot i think some of that come from consumer who expect a latte to be near the same temperature a a cup of drip coffee and it should not be we have a lot of former baristas working in our customer service center and i have heard their story anecdotally they estimate 75percent of customer walking into a chain cafe do not even know there is espresso in a latte and they were asked on a regular basis to make drink hotter they would do it but know they were ruining the flavor all that said i do think you should have your drink at the temperature you like there are no super auto that do extra hot milk all go to that 135 145ish range maybe microwave after the drink is made to bring the temp up breville doe make a semi auto machine the oracle touch with automatic milk frothing in a pitcher with settable milk temp and froth density it is a semi auto so it not press a button for a drink but it is automated far more than the typical espresso machine see it in action here it froth milk up to 165f and streamlines much of the manual process of semi auto espresso marc,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.5620006322860718, 0.38526085019111633, 0.0527384914457798]"

290,hi you are welcome thanks for the comment and question sour flavor generally indicate an under extraction but it could be the coffee a well if not the coffee under extraction can be caused by low brew temp small coffee dose and too coarse grind sound like you have got the grind down whenever i start with a new machine for espresso i make sure i set the grind a fine a it will go without choking the machine i set brew temp to highest hottest and coffee strength to highest level a for timing it can be difficult to equate timing of a semi auto machine to a super auto machine super auto generally extract faster main reason is they use a smaller coffee dose than commercial style semi auto most super auto machine have adaptive dosing the first few dos can be small a the machine learns how long to run the grinder to properly fill the brewing chamber marc,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5797685384750366, 0.22558753192424774, 0.19464388489723206]"

349,hi ihab thanks for the question a lot depends on the bean and the skill of the barista and those factor vary quite a bit by shop but you asked for percentage so i will try and quantify based on my experience in my area i estimate with good bean the espresso is a good a about 60percent of the cafe i have been to i do not frequent place like starbucks much but the vast majority of their location use super automatic machine to make espresso the 40percent that is better is the result of baristas with knowledge and skill the 40percent may be a a little generous in a random sample of cafe a i tend to go to place where i know i will get it done right typically a micro roaster with an in house cafe that is more focused on espresso coffee than drip style a for cappuccino the eletta doe a very good job a capp is the easiest beverage for this type of machine a the froth is airier than a latte and frothing for a latte is more difficult for machine or barista than for a capp hope that help,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7857143878936768, 0.10761232674121857, 0.10667325556278229]"

358,hi and thank you for the explanation appreciate it a lot we have our own filtering system which we use for drinking water and current espresso machine also delonghi it take away the chlorine and softens the water even though we have very soft water to begin with we also boil the water 15 minute before cooling and filtering just wanted to know if i would be forced to buy the filter every so often to make the machine work,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.845604658126831, 0.09345673024654388, 0.060938622802495956]"
359,i eva this machine can be used without a water filter but it is not advised the filter do 2 thing first they contain carbon to remove chlorine that help improve flavor and also prevents the formation of hydrochloric acid heating water containing chlorine creates the acid which in turn can cause corrosion of internal component not a big deal if it happens once in awhile but use without a filter for long duration and this could cause a problem second filter soften the water reduce the mineral level to prevent scale buildup when water is heated if mineral are above a certain level scale will form these machine use thermoblock boiler with narrow passage in which water is heated scale build up in those passage will eventually effect machine performance and if allowed to build up over long period premature machine failure all that said if you happen to have an un chlorinated water supply that is soft low in mineral you can get away without using a water filter,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.9200570583343506, 0.05021246150135994, 0.029730485752224922]"

393,hi thanks for your comment and question see below for a link to a side by side spec comparison of the eletta and barista express so the delonghi is a super automatic and the breville is a semi auto big difference in using these machine with the breville being much more hand on and requiring more skill on the part of the user with skill you will be able to produce better espresso and milk froth with the breville with the delonghi all it take is a single button push to make a milk based espresso beverage so the delonghi offer convenience while the breville offer higher drink quality both machine are mass produced and better classified a appliance that is true of all super automatic machine and very few semi auto once you get to a price level above entry level in semi auto most all of them with the exception of breville is are built by hand what breville ha done is packed a lot of desirable feature found on more expensive and more robustly constructed semi auto machine into a lower cost factory assembled appliance hope that help in your decision really come down to if you prefer convenience or potentially higher drink quality,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.49072059988975525, 0.4609752893447876, 0.048304107040166855]"

397,hi ahmed here is a link to a side by side spec comparison of the eletta and accademia a few key thing to consider comparing the 2 machine first temperature of coffee is essentially the same between the 2 they both have milk carafe the eletta us a dial to adjust froth density from the carafe the accademia ha adjustable froth density but you choose from 3 level in a menu to adjust both have steam wand but the accademia is a manual wand while the eletta is is an autofrothing wand the elettta is wand doe a nice job getting a fine texture but you will have more control some skill required with the accademia is to the point of doing milk definitely capable of pouring for latte art the accademia ha more metal on the case a little more solid in construction also more spout clearance for say a taller travel mug with accademia i use the accademia nearly everyday so i am a little biased perhaps one of my favorite feature on it is the sps flow control dial near the spout i often switch between doing espresso and long coffee into a taller travel mug that dial make a huge difference in the extraction reduce the flow rate for espresso and increase for long coffee to ovoid over extraction the eletta doe the pulse brewing for more of a drip style coffee but it take a while and 2 grind cycle to make a large cup i am fine with the longer coffee which come a lot faster on the accademia hope this all help i know it can be a tough choice let me know if you have any more question and i will do my bet to get you the answer,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.5983760356903076, 0.3438382148742676, 0.057785745710134506]"

399,it definitely ha the potential to produce better shot generally agreed that semi auto can make better espresso than super auto they give you much more control over brewing parameter of course that potential requires a level of knowledge and skill on the part of the user we do not think a pressure gauge is a must for producing good shot it can help let you know if you are way off like indicating channeling thru the coffee puck shot appearance timing and flavor are more important in our view than nailing a certain mark on a pressure gauge,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6156973838806152, 0.21687611937522888, 0.1674264669418335]"

401,hi marc do you think the gaggia classic would likely produce better espresso then the delonghi eletta reviewed here a to the rest of your comment i have the breville barista express bes870xl and looked into the gaggia classic among many other with help from your video i can still return the barista express but i do like the machine however seems we are always chasing the better espresso shot what sold me on the barista express is the pressure gauge adjustable brew temperature and not having to temperature surf deal with the switch over hassle of the classic and of course the appearance can not beat it on the counter v the classic i think having a pressure gauge is a must have in order to dial in and pull a consistently good espresso shot am i wrong about that you think,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.5147793889045715, 0.312664270401001, 0.1725563406944275]"
402,hi thanks for your comment here is a side by side spec comparison of those machine some thought on them the breville us a smaller pf at 54mm while the classic ha commercial standard heavyweight 58mm with the classic you will of course want a grinder a well interestingly we like the breville smart grinder pro a an economical companion to the classic you will probably be able to pull better shot with a separate grinder the 16 grind setting on the baristas built in grinder can be limiting like other breville product the sgp is considered by some a more of an appliance a opposed to a machine but should be fine for le demanding home use the classic is machine grade v the b barista appliance the classic is user serviceable if you are so inclined we generally do not recommend breville owner go inside the case another big difference is steaming it is autofrothing on the classic and commercial style manual on the breville it is tough to get a latte art capable microfoam with an autofrothing wand but the breville is not exactly a steaming powerhouse when compared to prosumer level hx and db machine both machine are single boiler sbdu so there is waiting for steam with both and manual cooling down required on the classic after steaming but we prefer the classic is boiler which contains a volume of water over the breville is thermocoil which is an on demand system with some practice and proper use the classic probably ha better temperature stability in the end the classic should produce better espresso when paired with a good grinder and user skill the breville doe okay but trade off some potential quality for ease of use hope that help let u know if you have any more question,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.62114417552948, 0.2545776963233948, 0.12427816540002823]"

406,hi pete it can do 2 double back to back no problem you do have other option like the low pressure pulse brewed long coffee or you can program an espresso to deliver more liquid volume which you prefer is up to your taste preference we do advise when pulling more volume with espresso process brewing that you adjust the grind coarser to avoid over extraction you will definitely save time and money over dollarbucks depending on the coffee you use a double espresso run about 20 cent in bean,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6741710305213928, 0.20281289517879486, 0.1230161190032959]"

486,i have been using this machine for a year now i can not say i like the foam it make there is just something that is off about it it good for making a fast caffeine bomb on a work morning but i would appreciate a separate steam arm that could be put in place of the milk container there is a separate hot water arm that attache to it milk is not hot enough for hot chocolate and at least on my machine the hottest coffee setting is not that hot my milk container is also annoyingly difficult to put on and out i literally have to hold the machine when pushing and be scared of breaking it when pulling the espresso it make is good and the grind brew unit ha not clogged up once i tried looking up the espresso dos it us but i could not find anything so you just have to experiment with the strength setting personally i find a huge difference in the order which the drink is prepared cappuccino is my drink of choice the cappuccino mode make the milk first and then the espresso and it end up tasting watery so i always brew the espresso first and then use the milk setting manually,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6563079953193665, 0.29442375898361206, 0.04926818609237671]"

528,mohd fahim abd rahman can not make normal coffee no cream on the top the taste is like a hot water if you make a milk base drink you can not feel the coffee at all and i did try all the setting from 1 to 10 and from 10 to 1 with many different coffee brand delonghi had been absolutely useless not only that they can not fix it but every time i got the machine back from them something is broken like the second time the top panel could be lifted up about 1cm they fixed that but now the on off button which use to be flat with the front panel is about 3mm below the level of the panel all that only show that there is no quality control at all i will make a video about that a i want this to be seen from a many people a possible and if i can help one person not to buy delonghi product i will be happy,"['video', 'not usability', 'usability']","[0.8516301512718201, 0.10625571012496948, 0.04211408644914627]"
529,hey glad to see you guy are having fun with your machine i love our machine too btw i did not see a filter when you filled the water tank did you add a filter if the water in your area is so hard i would put a filter on there for sure it should help your machine last longer and not sure but it might make the coffee taste better too happy latte gk,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.783220112323761, 0.1433187872171402, 0.07346102595329285]"

531,deirdre harness if your water is a hard a it seems i would use the filter or you can get a separate filter to filter your water before you put it into the machine that might work out cheaper seems expensive but if your kettle is getting scale on it currently imagine what the inside of your expensive coffee machine will get like,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7648656368255615, 0.15149065852165222, 0.08364370465278625]"
532,hi thank you for you comment from the instruction book we understood that if we put a filter in it would cost gbp10 00 for 2 month of use if we didn t use the machine for a week or two then the filter would only last 3 week it seems a bit expensive but i will try a filter to see if it taste better thank you for your advice,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6342537999153137, 0.20504236221313477, 0.1607038378715515]"
