0,yeah that grinder is loud but i imagine it is not any louder than my burr grinder,not really most are all about the same,thank you,would you recommend this machine over the lattago 5400,hmmmm tough one on warranty alone yes the eletta feel a little old school with the interface but a great workhorse for home,start making coffee at 3 17,can i know if this coffee machine allow manual milk frothing through the hot water wand meaning allow the steam to go out from the wand,no unfortunately you can not you would have to stick with the milk container system for milk drink,i am in canada and in process of buying a automatic machine shortly since this is basically an older machine now i believe what is your opinion on it v the new philip 5400 latte go when both are the same price at dollar1399 can i realize the philip ha more coffee option but a far a extraction are they equal overall or doe one excel here second which is overall easier to clean w the milk system and last which ha the longer standard factory warranty need to order shortly our last choice is a jura ena 8 but unsure if we really need to spend that much,they are both good machine we did a review of the 5400 on our channel but it wont be here till may been delayed so if you need one soon you are out of luck with that model extraction is about the same the philip is easier to clean but the delonghi not too hard either a for warranty delonghi win 2 1 year so three year that to me is the best selling point a for the ena 8 great for espresso but tough to get a good long coffee,could you do a review of the delonghi primadonna elite experience unboxing please most importantly how hot are the latte and cappuccino that come from the lettecreama system,once we get access to one we will,you prefer it over your wife do not let her hear that,i wa expecting to have compare between both and surprisingly wa just review of the black one without to give the minus and the plus with the white machine,they are exactly the same differ colour,how would you make an americano with this,mrsporkster what do you mean,you would not,will it do just hot milk for cocoa,doe this machine can make hot chocolate,no it doe not,so is it worth the 2k usd,jesus christ 2k in sweden it is at 500 dollar right now,it is on sale quite a bit,i just order the white one,i hardly comment on video but for the consumer i thought it should be my duty to write something to date my delonghi eletta ha done 3 352 coffee and going strong it is reliable simple and coffee are always hot it doe not look like the design ha changed too much so believe they have done a good job on the design cleaning is easy slim a to not take too much bench space the rinsing when you turn it on and off annoys the shit out of me but that is about it you can set the coffee the way you like it which is what i do but the overall feature are nice overall i think it a good buy hope this help anyone looking into buying a good coffee machine written by an australian coffee drinker,stuff it im getting one,hi you say this isnt your favorit espresso machine im looking for a full automatique espresso machine what is your suggestion thx you,susan cordeiro that super load grinder stopped me buying this,he say overall great machine a little big on the counter so keep that in mind aesthetically not my favourite looking machine but it is a nice i actually prefer it in the white he also said loud grinder nice crema great value lot of feature cleaning functionality for milk is great easy not much work cappuccino in under a minute with various strength and temperature sounded like to me he wa pleased overall with the performance,doe that machiene make cappuccino hot enough thanx in advance,it doe not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2,i like almost everything about this brewer my previous one wa a keurig 2 0 mybest kitchen and had a lot of issue this one is more basic but all the important feature are there if i had to name something i found a a negative it would be the size of the water tank i wa used to a larger one and have to fill this one daily a we drink 4 large cup every morning but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of thing,that is awesome thank you for your feedback,allo tu peux ajuster ta mouture avec le cadran dans la bo te grain toujours faire de ajustements le moulin en marche,can i save my own coffee,yes it is called amy coffee and you can set the amount of water that is added to the pure shot,this or dinamica plus which is better,my concern hot water plastic cancer,i have had 3 of these in three location for about 2 year they probably make 1500 2500 drink a year so far solid and really i like them better than any of the jura is i have owned better espresso drink and easier to clean,interesting i wa holding out for a jura but you say this is better,thank you for your feedback all the best,just bought this wow fantastic machine wonderful coffee can not recommend enough,thanks for your feedback enjoy,what are the dimension of this unit what would be considered a sharp price for this unit,hello how do you make espresso with this machine what setting and grinder setting would you recommend,jean yu in general to set the coffee machine normally you need to set up espresso first i have the same model grinder adjustment should be 1 9 then you should choose extra mild taste and here you go then press a short coffee,jean yu thank you for your feedback to be honest i do not drink espresso i only drink cappuccino and i have not tried that yet try the setting you mentioned and let me know,wy by adam lash thank you i am referring to espresso coffee without milk in the setting should i just select standard coffee standard taste and 1 cup for single shot,making hot drink using the milk menu a well a the coffee described above the machine automatically make milk hot milk caffelatte espresso macchiato and my milk customisable to make one of these hot drink proceed a follows 1 fill the milk container and attach it a described above 2 turn the froth adjustment dial on the milk container lid to the position corresponding to the required froth 3 press the milk menu button 4 press lt or gt until the required drink is displayed milk caffelatte espresso macchiato or my milk 5 press the ok button to start making the drink 6 after a few second frothed milk is delivered from the milk spout into the cup below for drink with coffee the machine automatically make the coffee after delivering the milk,check out the user manual here,wait what it say 120v but no 120v country ha 50hz electricity why doe it have a british plug is it a 230v version,wy by adam lash eu plug have a protective metal piece it is called the schutz kontakt schuko plug because of the top and bottom pe contact if i spelled it right look closer at the type e and f plug e ha an earth pin all socket are required to be equipped with the circuit protective conductor,this is the middle east version i live in dubai i guess it would be similar to the british standard all our plug here have three prong unlike the u russia and europe it is actually better because it is safer than the two prong the main difference between a two prong outlet and a three prong outlet is that a three prong outlet ha a ground wire while a two prong outlet doe not a ground wire is basically a wire that act a a shortcut and directs any surge of excess electricity to safely flow into the ground,doe this model have the automatic turn on time like say i can set it to turn on and warm at 6am,of course you can adjust through auto start for more information visit,uh oh loud is too reminiscent of cheap loud amp cheap sounding machine evoke untimely mechanical breakdown and dreaded nightmare repair i will take the delicious caffeine buzz all day but nix this buzz saw machinery,annette ryan yes what le noisy machine u recommend i have tinnitus so i find mine too noisy delonghi autentica,annette ryan grow up,cheap that must be a joke lol i do not know why you think this break down easily with nightmarish repair,nice video i am very impressed with it,all thanks to you man,feel like having our own coffee shop at home,mmmmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,i agree super helpful and much appreciated review,i like almost everything about this brewer my previous one wa a keurig 2 0 mybest kitchen and had a lot of issue this one is more basic but all the important feature are there if i had to name something i found a a negative it would be the size of the water tank i wa used to a larger one and have to fill this one daily a we drink 4 large cup every morning but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of thing,how would you compare this to the perfecta esam 5600 s,good how do you change from espresso bean to regular coffee bean tia,i have been on the fence about which machine to get so this video wa super helpful to me the eletta cappuccino top wa in my shortlist have not seen your channel before but will definitely be watching more of your vids very refreshing to have concise and informative content without all the unnecessary waffle thanks again and keep up the great work,do u use milk powder for milk,can the manual steamed milk be used for making latte art or perhaps using the frothed milk from the lattecrema,i do not know if i can trust an ad where they do not include a black and white dramatization bit where an actor us a fryer pan to make espresso,is the grinder a loud a the previous model that wa a big turn off for me,is this machine stainless,it is a combination of painted plastic chrome plating and metal throughout the body from personal experience it is one of the nicest looking machine in the market liam,hi great video what would you recommend this model over the dinamica model which are the difference,very good question the eletta is my personal favourite between the two a it seems to be capable of reaching a finer grind size for stronger espresso shot this is especially useful for milk based drink or straight espresso the dinamica machine have better tasting long coffee and also have a very well executed iced coffee function some of the newer dinamica machine the dinamica lattecrema and dinamica plus have better programability for user presets and advanced milk drink customization in the end it is up to personal preference liam,hello how do you make espresso with this machine what setting and grinder setting would you recommend,home coffee solution i have the same machine but i do not have the espresso double shot or single shot option on mine,espresso shot are easy with a one button push on the top interface you can select either isingle shot or wouldouble shot and program the dosage i would personally recommend starting at the 5 setting on the grinder and adjust the grind size to taste grind size largely depends on the coffee being used coarser grind le bitter more sour finer grind more bitter le sour each coffee ha a isweet spot but fairly easy to reach with a super automatic machine that is built to improve shot consistency liam,superb review,doe this machine make ice coffee,yes just need to brew an extra strong espresso shot over ice,i looked on your site and you are sold out of the silver and i am not in canada anyway i do not see silver available anywhere and it is not on the delonghi website either is it still available and is the silver front plastic like the other color or is it metal,home coffee solution thank you for the reply i actually purchased a silver one from the delonghi website and love it over the year i have had 2 jura and 2 saeco super automatic and this is by far the best the quality of the coffee is great and it is very easy to clean very happy with it thank you for providing such a great review,we are based in canada not sure what the current availability look like in the united state at the moment the silver version is mostly plastic but a few of the chrome accent seem to be metal overall the build quality is great compared to all the other machine in it price range,picked up this unit two week ago on sale for 1400 bottom line there is not another machine in this price range that offer auto froth and frothing wand two boiler great heating cup warmer on top we are still playing with the personal setting but honestly the setting right out of the box were great drink are hot even on the medium setting foam from the auto frother is great allowing you to choose how much froth you want the user interface is fairly simple oh and the clean up is stupid easy contrary to some other brand that require pill and special basin etc this frother only requires you to turn the knob to clean and with 10 second it is done remove the milk canister and put it in fridge until needed honestly i really can not find any fault with this machine we will see how it hold up to daily use,mel c yessir 3 4 coffee drink every day without any issue still enjoy my cappuccino is and espresso i would purchase again,i think i have made my final decision on this model are you still happy with your purchase thank you,sarah teunissen hi it wa purchased at the linen chest they still had them on sale a few month ago ftr i am about 8 month out since getting it it is performed perfectly and both my wife and i love it,where did you purchase it for that deal thanks,how many gram of coffee in extra strong,the video wa very interesting i enjoy espresso every day with delonghi is magnifica s i also subscribed to the channel please come visit me on my channel with love from japan,can you tell me how i clean the steamer after steam,a simple purge running the steaming wand without milk and a quick wipe off with a towel with suffice for basic cleaning i would recommend removing the plastic cover every couple of week and using soap and water to more thoroughly clean out the component steam is a natural sanitizer so any remaining residue will likely be baked on sugar,hi nice video how doe this machine compare to the newer dinamica w lattecrema waffling between the two now that the price on the eletta gop ha come way down in pric,the eletta can go to a finer grind size which is better for espresso shot and milk based beverage it also ha an active cup warmer which can make a big difference in beverage temperature the dinamica ha better customization more drink and a really good iced coffee function in the end it is up to personal preference but i would personally choose the eletta just based on the grind option liam,fantastic machine my only criticism is the confusing operating instruction which appear to have no logical order for example fitting the water filter is several page in whereas it should be listed a one of the first thing to do in the setup i have also found the menu confusing but maybe that is just me have not yet mastered the automatic on setting but will persevere a the auto off appears to override this setting in summary a great machine but patience is needed to understand the various capability of fine tuning your coffee,hello guy i bought it exactly same coffe machine 8 month ago for couple time i use it but yesterday after month when turn on it try to get cappuccino is going like preparation underway is stop late flat white milk menu still same anyone know what is the problem thanks,can you tell me how this is against the other delonghi machine the delonghi magnifica bean to cup coffee machine black ecam22 360b many thanks,the eletta can reach a much finer grind size and ha an active cup warmer for hotter beverage overall the result will be better on the eletta,f,is is possible to use the frother wand to make hot chocolate put the frother wand into metal jug of coco powder and milk like how baristers make them in costa and starbucks,absolutely this is one of the best feature of the frothing wand you can also use it for other drink like matcha latte liam,hi can you put chai or milo into the bypass doser,just put your milo in the cup first then go to milk menu and fill up with milk do not forget to set your froth dial to preferred level also if you do not want it all milk then simply add some hot water from hot water spout first before attaching the milk carafe,good question the bypass doser can clog when used with other thing such a tea or hot chocolate and so we only recommend using it with pre ground coffee,can you please tell me it is model no,the letter on the end change for each colour so s silver b black w white mine is ecam45760b,model is ecam45760s,man i need one of those,i am sold look amazing,it sold out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,dearly love to know how a test mode could be performed on this machine ta,what are the difference between this machine and the dinamica plus other than the 600 00 price difference,hi marc thanks for the review i have spent quite a while watching them if i wa not in the uk i would sure be purchasing from you despite the nice guy from gaggia in the uk trying to persude me to go manual and venture down the wand route i know myself too well so it will be a carafe model for me i have pretty much narrowed it down between the eletta but only with a carafe and not a wand option and the magenta prestige the prestige is about gbp150 more than the eletta do you think the gaggia is worth the extra i prefer the gaggia is look and the menu seems nore user friendly but gbp150 is a lot of coffee bean,hi mark what is the recommendation grind setting if i use lavazza super crema bean which setting would you like to set,whole latte love if it is you which number you would set,hi bryant when using a super auto for espresso i always start with the finest grind setting highest temperature and highest coffee dose if coffee is bitter you can back off on the grind setting from there,hi could anyone please tell me the difference between the delonghi eletta and the delonghi eletta evo machine i can find plenty info on the eletta but not the eletta evo thanks,recently i have noticed that the coffee ha become lighter with not enough crema and the colour is light a well no setting ha changed this ha happened just a few day ago any idea it seems that not enough coffee is being used but the amount of coffee is the same a it wa before just not rich enough,what is the difference between this and the eletta evo,hi i am a newbie on super automatic machine which i do not know anything about coffee machine i would like to have advise on how to use the delonghi dinamica machine which i had just bought a per check the grind size is around 5 i would like to make an espresso which is the same taste a i am having when going to starbucks a per check the flow is quite fast could you advise what is the best grinding setting recommend on this machine and do i need to turn to turn to 7 first and turn to 1 per click need to adjust while grinding how to know is this machine had extract the best espresso,any reply,whole latte love what about temperature should i set to medium or low so you would recommend to set to the finest setting for espresso if it get drip for single espresso tune it a bit courser am i right,hey bw thanks for the question for best espresso flavor we always suggest setting super automatic machine grinder to their finest setting if the finest setting should cause the machine not to brew you can always set it a little coarser but not brewing at finest setting is rare when adjusting to a finer grind setting the grinder should be running when making the adjustment that is not possible on all machine a some have safety mechanism which prevent the grinder from operating whne been hopper door are open if that is the case for you only adjust 1 click in between each grinding can not compare flow rate of super auto machine to those of semi auto machine the brewing chamber in super auto is much different in geometry than the filter basket of semi auto machine beyond that coffee dos tend to be a lot smaller hope that help,great video when i am steaming the milk should i wait for the machine to stop or can i pressed to button and stop it myself if the milk is hot enough for me i wa worried that if i stop it would change the setting of steam i hope you understand my question thank you for your lovely review,awesome review thank you can you tell me do you have to wait for the unit to finish brewing the entire cup of coffee or can you remove the pot grab a cup and return the pot to finish brewing,hi ar thanks for the kind comment and question i am a little stumped though this machine doe not brew into a pot just cup marc,the best review he made me buy this machine the others were not so enlightening greeting from chile,thank you very much,hello mark thank you very much for your video they are excellent i need your help pls i am between the gaggia babilla and delonghi elleta capuccino which one do you recommend which one is more durable what are the main difference between them thank you,hey jennifer you are welcome for the video here is a link to side by side spec comparison of the babila and eletta if i were choosing i would go with the babila it is a more durable build with a metal skin on the case front and top it ha 2 boiler so it is faster when making milk drink it ha more clearance under the spout for taller cup like travel mug my favorite feature is the flow control dial on the babila is spout it allows one to fine tune flavor by speeding up an extraction for larger coffee and slowing it down for espresso i like the babila milk carafe which doe a quick automatic steam cleaning through the frothing component when you push the milk dispensing spout over the steam go through the carafe handle and into the drip tray so there is no mess after that the carafe go back in the fridge ready for next use it also ha a manual steam wand so you can froth to latte art quality if desired in case you missed it here is my video review of the babila it includes a look at the gaggia accademia which is a very similar machine hope that help marc,hello i have a question and i hope someone can guide me i do not know whether to buy the delonghi eletta capuccino super automatic or gaggia anima prestige it is for my girlfriend if someone could guide me thank you,whole latte love i am from chile the gaggia cardona prestige it not available in my country yet,hi u if considering the delonghi i would have a look at the gaggia cadorna prestige imo it is more machine for le dollardollar get excellent owner review and feature a more modern interface here is a side by side spec comparison with current pricing of the delonghi the gaggia and a comparable jura machine i have been using the cadorna daily in the studio for about 8 month now and love it here is a video with a detailed overview of the cadorna prestige hope that help marc,thank you sir,welcome,hi marc i have a choice between 2 machine either the jura s8 or the delonghi eletta which one is easier to use along with better tasting coffee if you were to buy one which one would you choose,hi rich thanks for the question imo the jura s8 is a step above the delonghi much nicer ui overall better experience using the machine i prefer the style of the jura and it ha pulse extraction process pep which is used for espresso but not for long coffee that allows one to switch from espresso to longer coffee without changing grind size marc,how doe this compare the jura,whole latte love thanks for your quick response i wa looking at the jura e8 same price a this one,hi abel depends to some extent on witch jura you are comparing to a there is a wide range in capability across jura is product lineup in general jura tends to have more advanced user interface and convenience feature for example use an in reservoir filter in jura machine and descaling is never required some jura machine use pep pulse extraction process when making espresso which result in a deeper more aromatic extraction marc,hello how can i make espresso drink with this machine can not seem to get the right setting on my eletta cappuccino machine what setting and grinder setting would you recommend,whole latte love thanks so much marc,hi jean thanks for the question when i make espresso on a super automatic machine i always start with the grinder set to it finest setting and use the highest coffee strength setting and temperature if it is too strong back off on the strength setting i f getting bitter increase the grind size hope that help marc,could this machine make ice coffee,jenny lee i prefer the jura machine better user interface imo,i see that machine but it is been out of stock for awhile what would you pick if you have a choice between eletta and jura s8,hi jenny thanks for the question it is not setup with a specific brewing for iced coffee but iced coffee is generally just coffee poured over ice so could do that this delonghi machine doe have a specific iced coffee function marc,hi would you recommend the eletta or the primadonna elite,hi james the pde marc,can you please share your thought about the comparison between this machine and a manual home espresso machine on the basis of the espresso quality,thank you sir,hi ag thanks for the question the potential quality of a manual machine is higher but it take knowledge skill time to realize the potential what automatic machine offer is consistently good quality with convenience marc,great video anyone ever tell you that you look like kevin sorbo,hi nsn thanks for the comment no you are the first marc,having a tough time with the decision between the delonghi eletta gaggia cadorna prestige and the jura e8 or s8 i have watched all of your video but having trouble breaking down the small difference any advice,hi maggie i gave you a more specific response in another comment imo the prestige is the best value and most capable of the group one thing you might do is read the verified user review of the machine to better understand the difference in day to day use marc,great vid just bought one and am very impressed i just find the espresso shot is poured very quickly like 5 second how can i slow this down a i am used to 20 25,how can i make a perfect black coffee by this machine should i press the long button or just a double shot water,hi asim double shot water is what is called an americano pressing the long button will get you closer to a standard black coffee you can also adjust grind size to taste you may want to make it a little courser,one of the only video i have found which demonstrates having the milk carafe on and taking it off and using the wand i had assumed you needed a different model for that function you have made me really close to pulling the trigger on one,i want coffee machine how can i make oder,hi a2z thanks for the question go here for everything coffee,hi how can i set my favourite coffee for example i like it very strong and very hot in a small or medium cup size coffee in one touch i just got it new but not 100percent know how to set it thank you,hi nk programming different strength and cup size is very easy and explained well in the machine is manual,great review where can we find those amazing glass they add so much to the presentation of the drink i searched a few site but did not find anything a impressive a these,hi fm1 thanks for the comment and question the glass with the half heart shape handle were from delonghi but we got them 8 year ago and to best of my knowledge they are no longer available marc,we are frequent tea drinker and so looking for an automatic coffee machine that also dispenses hot water i noticed in your review that this eletta model doe that but how well is this performed i can see in the video where you show a cup and a tea bag the water flow seems very slow how long doe it take to dispense 250ml of hot water if i wa making two cup of tea two people would hot water become available instantly after the first cup is poured or is there a delay,thank you so much,hi plus you are welcome and thanks for the comment marc,thank you sir for the review i have purchased the machine but i am little confused with the term short standard long and extra long which is the drip coffee which is the espresso,hi aa you are welcome drip coffee would be the long or extra long and the espresso is short or standard marc,hi marc i bought this machine in april we are very happy with it but find it complicated i like a flat white but i am confused a to how to change the coffee strength the manual is complex can you advise me please thank you,hi af thanks for the question coffee strength is adjusted using the button with the bean symbol on left side of display 5 coffee strength are available here is a link to section of this video which demonstrates how to change the strength hope that help marc,if i set to fine grind setting after 3 cup if i feel the taste is only bitter and no acidic furthermore the water flow start to be dripping after that it will have normal water flow is it the grind size i set is too fine do i need to set courser setting please advise,hi bw yes i would set grind coarser if getting bitter flavor and slow drip marc,i have the 1200 00 model that is just below this model and i am honestly glad i got my machine it is virtually the same a this machine except for two or three extra drink that this thing make not understanding what exactly make this one cost 800 00 more can people possibly tell a difference from a taste test absolutely no way,thanks for sharing,hi please tell me which one is better seaco 8977 or eletta,for medium roast lavazza super crema bean what is the best grind size setting for best espresso flavour,whole latte love if i get dripping when i press dbl espresso with max aroma doe it mean that the grind size to too fine please advise,hi bw when making espresso on these machine i always recommend to start with the finest grind setting if get too much bitter flavor then back off on the grind size a click or two marc,what is the best grind size for perfect espresso,whole latte love i would like to check yesterday after i had brew espresso on my super automatic machine the puck is very good which is like a cake but today it become very soft is it because my coffee bean is not fresh already which i need to get a new pack,hi bryant thanks for the question on super auto machine like the one featured in this video i use the finest grind setting for espresso depending on the coffee it is possible that setting could choke the machine if that happens then try a slightly larger grind size setting marc,do u have review for delonghi dinamica ecam350 75 s,able to request,hi bw thanks for the question unfortunately i do not,hi i bought new one 440 b but when i put powder it is fall down and asked me to fill the tank please advise me how to use the powder and bean,hi ef thanks for the question not sure i understand but i will take a shot filling the tank think that mean add water reservoir to use pre ground coffee you need to use the coffee strength setting to cycle through to the icon for using pre ground,could someone clarify if coffe taste strength affect preprogrammed coffes like cappuccino or long i can not find any info about that but on my machine the setting seems to have no effect on these and a a result the preprogrammed milk coffes are rather weak is this normal also the grinder seems to have only 7 setting not 13,hey stefan i got this machine about a month ago and had similar question about it in the beginning keep in mind the espresso shot it produce are single not double and the single shot is approx 7g of ground coffee it may taste weak to you if you are used to the double shot that most coffee shop make or maybe you yourself have been previous to getting the eletta upping the coffee taste to extra strong will definitely give you a bolder taste i found that this machine start to make optimal shot after about a week to 10 day of daily use i have about 4 6 shot worth of espresso in various drink daily i found all the coffee it make are near perfect in taste except the flat white which i found a bit weak a it us a single shot i make flat white a a double ristretto and adding milk from the middle setting on the frother manually that make a solid flat white the grinder ha 13 setting in total look for the numberless notch between the number you can dial it in to each notch a needed i also found the espresso wa initially extracting in about 10 second and wa definitely a bit watery after playing around with the grinder setting and running through 15 20 test shot i got it to extracting in about 16 18 second and with much better crema and amber colored flow any longer and the shot were definitely over extracted and too bitter sixteen to 18 second seems to be the sweet spot also have you tested your local water and set the machine to the correct hardness level and are you using filtered water i found a huge difference in taste between unfiltered and filtered water with my local water supply,hi marc is this machine comparable to a good manual coffee machine in term of taste and aroma i am not sure if an automatic machine will have a different result,hi crystal thanks for the question it come close but potential quality of a manual machine is higher realizing that potential take time skill and effort automatic machine are about convenience with consistent quality imo their quality is better than what you will get in most mass market chain coffee shop hope that help marc,thank you sir this is a great and brief review i love it,glad you enjoyed it marc,,hello i am thinking of buying one of the delonghi machine but i am a little confusing between eletta cappuccino v eletta cappuccino top i have no idea what is the difference between them what should get,hi saleh thanks for the question they are very similar machine i would go with either whatever you get the best deal on,i already have my own super auto but i still wtach video lol i might be the lazy type of coffee geek xd,hi pc i know the feeling marc,hi mark which color do you think would look better white or black silver thank you,hey tom i personally have it in white because it reminds me of a 1970s lambo countach is aesthetic d but that is just me,hi tom thanks for the question rather subjective i know which ever color i picked my wife would probably want the other marc,what is the difference with the eletta plus v eletta cappuccino,i have just bought this machine and still learning what it is all about but so far i am very pleased the only thing i would like to ask is about the display panel when the machine is not making coffee what exactly is supposed to be displayed mine display what strength of coffee i like but i wa not sure if this is what it should be,great review mate,glad you liked it marc,hi i bought this machine in december 2019 the milk doe not want to froth what can be the problem,hi s thanks for the question so is it putting out milk but it is not a frothy milk if so the most likely cause of poor frothing performance is a blockage in the milk frothing component there may be hardened milk residue which need to be cleaned out if you can not resolve with a thorough cleaning of component contact delonghi support here,seriously an awesome review there is absolutely no reason someone should have marked this down i just do not get people great job and i really like all the aspect marc discussed this machine will be a great replacement for my esam 3500 i have loved for 10 year,hi dp thanks a whole latte for your comment glad you enjoyed the video marc,which model is similar to this but can handle taller cup,hi rr have a look at the gaggia accademia it handle taller cup ha 3 level of milk froth density using a carafe system manual frothing wand in addition to carafe and my favorite feature flow control on the coffee spout so you can restrict flow for espresso and increase flow for long coffee here is a video comparing the accademia to the similar gaggia babila link to more info on the accademia including review marc,hi nice presentation thank you one question can the machine make two coffee at once regard,hi tlk you are welcome and thank you for the comment and question yes you can make 2 coffee at the same time marc,hi marc just curious if i can use home made nut milk for making latte and cappuccino thank you,hi ad thanks for the question i do not see why not we have used store bought non dairy milk alternative marc,doe anyone know if on display i can set the clock and how in energy saver mode thanks,hi ma here is a link to the manual for the machine instruction for energy saving mode on page 11 marc,hi there please can people let me know the temperature of the milk provided most review i have read across the delonghi range for most milk container say the milk come out warm but not hot most people tend to say that they need to microwave their cappuccino or latte in the microwave which is making me think twice about it please please can people share their honest opinion below thanks,hi joe giving actual temp is difficult a a variety of factor have an affect temp of milk in carafe ambient temp temp of serving cup etc most machine produce a froth of 130 145f depending on external factor pro baristas froth milk to 140f a that is were milk is sweetest due to heating marc,wow this must be the brief and the best video of product amazing job ive decided to buy after this one,hi pc thanks for the comment marc,hi marc can you tell me what milk product are best to use for latte whole milk 2percent etc excellent video thanx,hi bill thanks for the comment and question we prefer whole milk for the sweet creamy texture it produce can use other type but nothing beat the whole milk marc,how much did this machine cost then,ho oz thanks for the question current pricing here,how doe this machine do when making shot back to back is it good for entertaining like making capps for party here and there,hi cc thanks for the question no problem making shot back to back these machine are convenient for entertaining with one touch milk based espresso beverage there are other machine like the jura x8 which can make 2 milk based espresso beverage simultaneously and allows for instant drink customization,doe it have pre infusion,thank you,it doe not have an adjustable pre infusion,how it this for a small business,hi pr thanks for the question do you mean to make coffee etc for employee or were you thinking for commercial use it would be okay for light employee use but it is not rated at all for commercial service marc,i recently bought this coffee maker that i think is excellent but i think the unit i received ha a defect the warming tray is always working although in the display option i have configured it a deactivated should this be the case or is my coffee maker defective thank you,hi n thanks for the comment and question a defect is possible but can not say for sure that is your issue delonghi ha excellent customer support i would contact them here marc,hallo everytime i make coffie with this machine somewhere in the back leak water any idea why,hi dj thanks for the question could be a number of thing causing the issue i would contact delonghi support here is contact info for their international support,is there much difference between this model and the ecam44 66 also which decaffeinated coffee bean would you recommend for this machine,have noticed that delonghi machine have problem makin the crema,hello this probably the best review for this machine on youtube and it made me purchase the eletta since it had so many feature and make many kind of drink with one touch however i receive it last week and i feel i got a faulty machine the one touch for cappuccino and latte macchiato is making the same exact coffee size and foam even if i set the froth dial at the middle position for latte macchiato i still get the same size foam and flavor i am aware that you can customize the quantity of milk and coffee but that defeat it purpose for being a fully automatic with presets another issue is that when making flat white or caffelatte the machine will overflow my largest cup which is about 400 ml also the froth foam for flat white is twice larger than a cappuccino foam even if i set the dial to the middle position btw i did the reset twice from the menu but still same issue however all other drink like espresso double espresso and long coffee are working fine do you think i should get a replacement since i still got 3 week left of the return window thank you,thearmybrat23 i have the same issue i can not adjuste the cup size i can not have small or big size cappucino or latte always the same how did you solve it,great tutorial thanks do you know how many mililiters or cc is the bigger coffee that the machine can serve,hi gc thank you for the comment and question the eletta is programmable dispensing up to 120ml on the extra long coffee setting here is a link to the eletta manual see page 12 for the full range of programmable volume marc,hi i have just purchased this machine and over a 2 week period i have had to descale it twice i am on tank water with associated filtration and when testing the hardness the water it showed that it wa soft so i have not used the filter do you have any advice so i do not have to descale so often,hi stuart that doe not sound right is the machine telling you to descale only thing i can think of is for some reason the machine doe not think you descaled or completed the descaling cycle the first time around with soft water if you entered hardness info into the machine it should not be telling you to descale 2 week after first use marc,hi marc i have done some extensive investigation and after endless comparison list and watching yours and many video we have ended up with the delonghi eletta super automatic we were trying to kick our daily sb latte fix 0 so far we are very happy with the machine my husband however say it is just not hot enough i have put it on the hottest temperature setting for the espresso with my research i saw that this is a frequent complaint with the super automatic i even watched your video on getting hotter drink if i put boiling water in the ceramic mug and let it sit for 2 minute and do a rinse of the machine and a clean of the carafe to run hot water through the spout prior to making the drink the final coffee drink is indeed hotter i can get the temperature just up to 140 degree but that doe take some of the automatic out of our process of course we can use the wand and get the milk hotter but again that make it le automatic with our old manual machine we never heated the milk above 150 degree would love to hear your thought on this are we doing everything you know of to get hotter milk is there a different super automatic that produce a hotter drink thanks for any advice you can offer and your many great video,my pleasure,whole latte love thanks so much for all the information,hi jodi apology for the delayed response thank you for the comment and question well you are doing all the thing to get a hotter drink for higher milk temp you could try using an using an airier froth setting on the carafe dial it change froth density but put milk in contact with steam longer so it get warmer a couple other idea warm the milk for 10 second prior to adding to carafe bottom line is the machine are designed to heat milk into the goldilocks zone of temperature for most apparent sweetness which is around 140f if you go to a specialty cafe not the chain that is what you will get from a properly trained barista can not tell you how many chain shop heat milk far too much i know some people want it hot i think some of that come from consumer who expect a latte to be near the same temperature a a cup of drip coffee and it should not be we have a lot of former baristas working in our customer service center and i have heard their story anecdotally they estimate 75percent of customer walking into a chain cafe do not even know there is espresso in a latte and they were asked on a regular basis to make drink hotter they would do it but know they were ruining the flavor all that said i do think you should have your drink at the temperature you like there are no super auto that do extra hot milk all go to that 135 145ish range maybe microwave after the drink is made to bring the temp up breville doe make a semi auto machine the oracle touch with automatic milk frothing in a pitcher with settable milk temp and froth density it is a semi auto so it not press a button for a drink but it is automated far more than the typical espresso machine see it in action here it froth milk up to 165f and streamlines much of the manual process of semi auto espresso marc,can other milk such a coconut and soy able to be used,hi jack please excuse my delayed response i have been offline for a few day i usually try and answer all question within one business day anyway we have done a bunch of testing with non dairy milk soy work coconut milk froth terribly i have tried it in super auto and high end commercial machine and never been successful coconut milk is very watery and lacking fat which help with frothing macadamia nut milk froth very well it came out on top in the non diary category in recent testing we did get more result of our milk test here,we are bought the saeco picobarista hd8927 47 i found it is not easy to make a just drip coffee with it v an americano is it easier to make a drip coffee with the delonghi do you prefer one over the other also i noticed when you want a double the machine doe two individual single shot verse one single double shot is this the same with the delonghi,hi colleen neither machine technically make a drip coffee a they use the espresso brewing process what they make is considered a long coffee sometimes called a cafe crema it sound like you want to make a larger cup of coffee the eletta can make long coffee and us pulse brewing which lower the brewing pressure in pulse to avoid over extracting the coffee when making larger cup the pulse brewing process produce a coffee that more closely resembles drip than many competing machine compared to the saeco i like the pulse brewing cup warmer slightly higher water capacity angled display adjustable milk froth density and included manual steaming wand hope that help marc,hi marc about the dispensing the hot milk alone the machine will dispense it or should be done in the auto frothing thanks,whole latte love hi marc it me again last week i purchashed the ecam44 660b ellata but there is no option for espresso macchiato how can i make one with my machine,hi ml thanks for the question the machine can dispense just hot milk,i am interested in this machine for it milk drink but also just plain coffee doe this machine using the drip style long produce good coffee in comparison to a regular drip machine,whole latte love hi marc which jura do you use at home and what would you recommend for a household that typically drink americanos and latte i have been watching so many espresso machine review video and i am just more confused than before i started,no problem,thank you so much for such a prompt and thorough response have a great day,hi scott thanks for the question yes it doe i use a gaggia babila machine for long coffee at the office everyday and have a jura super auto at home they brew using the same basic process a the eletta compared to drip you have the ability to adjust grind size coffee dose and length those control let you fine tune the flavor marc,marc other than the steam attachment is there any other difference between the ecam 44660b and the ecam45760b debating between this machine the gaggia accademia babila or the jura e8,hi je thanks for the question the delonghi eletta machine are very similar the 44 660 b ha a different display and control panel accademia ha 3 level of menu programmable froth density by drink babila doe not both the gaggia machine have a manual steam wand in addition to the self cleaning carafe you can do a much finer froth using the manual wand i also love the flow control dial on the gaggia machine it is awesome if you switch between espresso and larger cup of coffee the e8 ha the nicest display and is a little easier to maintain it use cleaning tablet for the non removable brew group and if you use a water filter no descaling is ever required on the other machine you remove the group and rinse with tap water once a week hope that help let me know if you have more question marc,how doe it stack up against a breville dual boiler which one delivers the best coffee flavor thinking of getting my first espresso machine thanks,whole latte love thanks so much marc went with the de longhi thanks,hi antonio the bdb is a semi automatic machine it is capable of making better espresso than a super auto machine like the eletta but there is more skill knowledge required to operate the bdb to get a better espresso marc,hi mark thanks for a great review i just purchased the eletta i have a question my first batch of coffee turned out quite acidic sour and it seems the extraction from pump on to last drip is about 14 second for a short size is this normal or is this low i wa told around 25 second is ideal i am not sure how to change this to longer i have set the grinder to the finest no 1 would you know thanks so much,whole latte love hi marc my preference is cappuccino and have tried all the tip but just can not get rid of the bitter after taste i just can not seem to get the bistro quality even when using their bean is medium roast the correct choice and should the grind be between 5 7,miytok happy to help let me know how it go again it is normal for the first 5 or so shot to be a little on the weak side on most brand new super auto a the machine learns how much coffee to grind,whole latte love thanks so much marc you are brilliant i understand this a whole lot more now will keep on trying,hi you are welcome thanks for the comment and question sour flavor generally indicate an under extraction but it could be the coffee a well if not the coffee under extraction can be caused by low brew temp small coffee dose and too coarse grind sound like you have got the grind down whenever i start with a new machine for espresso i make sure i set the grind a fine a it will go without choking the machine i set brew temp to highest hottest and coffee strength to highest level a for timing it can be difficult to equate timing of a semi auto machine to a super auto machine super auto generally extract faster main reason is they use a smaller coffee dose than commercial style semi auto most super auto machine have adaptive dosing the first few dos can be small a the machine learns how long to run the grinder to properly fill the brewing chamber marc,finally a non german dutch review great in depth info thanks,hi k you are welcome and thank you for the comment,should i buy this or gaggia velesca or anima plz help whole latte love,hi i would go with the anima prestige it ha slightly larger capacity for water and used coffee and ha clearance for taller cup,whole latte love my main drink is a cappuccino super machine,hi s thanks for the question to help you pick the right machine please tell me what kind of drink you will make the most and other thing you are looking for in a machine marc,hi i just got the machine and i have a problem with it every time it is say empty ground container i clean it but still persist and i can not use it i do not know what to do,thank you so much i contacted them and they cleaned it and now it working i could say that is really sensitive machine any coffee residue can block it,hi bb sorry to hear you are having a problem have you contacted delonghi support here is how if you purchased the machine from u in u you can contact our tech support people here,it look like a video from the 90 is,ll the answer is definitely no but that is a good one,yeh clear and coherent you obviously prefer something produced on tiktok lip synched justin bieber voice over,retro,great video just bought one but it keep saying fill bean hopper when it is already full any idea please,did you solve it i do not have this machine but i feel bad for you,hi just purchased what i believed to be this model based on your review but it doe not seem grind the the bean a it pours the milk is there a setting i can change otherwise really pleased with the machine thanks to your excellent review,so this is the eletta ecam 45 760 how is the ecam 44 660 different,the 44 660 is the one costco sell slightly different display i believe,hi s unfortunately i can not tell you a i am unfamiliar with the other machine may be a model not generally available in u,hi is there a way to have the coffee come first then the milk,hi j thanks for the question this machine and the majority of similar machine steam the milk first there are a few which can do coffee first a couple of jura machine make flat white and do the coffee first then the milk like the jura e8 here is a video review of the jura e8 marc,do you think this machine would be right for an office where the consumption of coffee in various form is roughly 50 cup a day,hi yahya i would go with a machine with larger capacity for bean water and spent coffee ground if you anticipate doing a lot of milk drink i would want more milk capacity a well perhaps in a standalone outboard refrigerated unit check out the jura giga machine here there are dual bean hopper model so you can have regular and decaf bean here is the jura cool control 34oz outboard refrigerated milk system next step up from jura are full on commercial system from franke,excellent video very well presented i have an old delonghi that is getting a bit tired a it is used so much and will probably replace it with the reviewed model i live in the uk so will be buying here but nevertheless a great video thanks,hi steven thanks for the comment hope you enjoy your machine marc,this machine is heavenly i have it and i love it very much thank you delonghi,hi me happy to hear you are loving your machine and thank you for the comment marc,hi just got this machine after seeing your review so thanks for the great service had a quick question in term of the milk once you use it can you keep it in the fridge till expiry date in the container or do you need to use it the next day worried that if you heat milk doe it go stale after 24 hour and also doe it affect the milk storage device to store milk for more than 1 day thanks,hi gani thanks for the question and comment the milk in the attachable carafe is not heated until it undergoes frothing at the head of the unit so milk in carafe only warms naturally while attached to the machine if you only have it attached to the machine for making drink and then return to fridge you should be able to use more than one day do run the cleaning cycle before returning the carafe to fridge that clean the frothing component so it froth properly on next use marc,hey im thinking about getting this one i am worried about noise though is this one overly loud when grinding the coffee bean,whole latte love oh thanks for getting back to me what machine would you say are similar to this but quiter,hi katrina thanks for the question most super automatic machine are fairly similar in noise level when grinding always will be some if concerned about noise in my experience there are a few machine which are a bit quieter when grinding check out the jura s8 it ha a heavy metal cover over the hopper which help reduce grinding noise also have a look at the gaggia babila it ha an internal gasketed cover on the hopper and an external cover babila is a machine which i use daily one of my favorite marc,hi i want to buy this one or gaggia anima prestige but not sure which one to get i am very interested which one make hotter black long coffee thank you,whole latte love thank you thats the one i like the most out of all this sort of machine will definitely purchase next month,hi ar thanks for the question the anima prestige ha 3 temperature setting and make a hot long coffee,can you use creamer in the milk container of the eletta machine,hi j not something we have tried but no harm if you want to have a go with creamer only caveat might want to stay away from creamer with added sugar or flavoring they could gum up the work and require deeper cleaning of the frothing component,thanks i saw everything i needed to know,hi tim you are welcome and thank you for the comment,hi which of these machine do you recommend delonghi eletta cappuccino top ecam 45 760 w delonghi esam6600 primadonna siemens ti903209rw eq 9 s300,hi hykran thanks for the question i like the adjustable milk froth density on the eletta we do not carry the esam 6600 primadonna i think it is an older model which ha been replaced by the gran dama 6620 the 6620 is currently out of stock and i have not personally used it we do not carry siemens machine so i have no opinion on those,hi mark what about travel mug is there a setting for that or just pick long coffee thanks,hi calico thanks for the question you can program the long coffee for higher volume if you like it strong you may want to program for a smaller volume and brew 2 into a single cup be aware spout clearance on the eletta is 5 5 so a tight fit for taller mug cup marc,hi really great video i am looking at purchasing this machine or the delonghi autentica cappuccino other than the doppio function is there any real difference in the machine is one better quality part than the other,hi fiona thanks for the comment and question i am not 100percent certain but believe they are the same or very similar i think the autentica model is a uk and or eu model,looking at getting this machine but because my existing auto machine ha a terrible process for releasing the tamped coffee ground with the eletta do you know how the ground get binned is it from above or pushed from the side or what my current one push them from the side and a you would expect there is significan not spillage that build up over a month which then requires a lengthy cleaning process hoping the eletta is better hope it is not too late to get some feedback thanks,whole latte love thanks for the response mostly pleased with not noticing grind missing the bin we have a wmf pro s commercial auto machine which we are looking to replace with the eletta at work cheer,hi colin never to late we monitor comment for all of our 1 200 video and try to respond to all comment question within 1 business day i am curious what machine you have that push used grind out to the side in the eletta used grind are pushed out at 45 degree angle kind of up and forward and drop into a grind bin which sits in a drip tray centered in the machine i have not noticed grind missing the bin,i just purchased this machine and i have to say i am extremely impressed with it thus far i read a lot of thing on line about how the milk doe not get warm enough well that is just not the case the temperature of the drink is perfect and the ease of use of the machine is fantastic highly recommended,what are your view 2 year later do you still use the machine have you come across any issue,hey im thinking about getting this one i am worried about noise though is this one overly loud when grinding the coffee bean,hi david thank you for the comment sharing your opinion of the machine happy to hear you are impressed,great thorough review thank you for this this seems to fit our need perfectly before purchasing i wa curious if you knew if the entire brewing process for a standard cup of coffee is plastic free once it leaf the plastic water tank i know the plastic part are bpa free however doe water ever touch plastic once it leaf the water tank maybe the same question for the milk process if you happen to know again thanks for the great video feed,hey thanks marc for the quick reply i wa able to get in touch with a delonghi representative who wa able to open up one of their machine to help answer the question her reply wa that it go from the water tank plastic and through a plastic tube all plastic are bpa free into an aluminum heating element where water would first get hot once the water is heated there it then will quickly pas through a small grey plastic part a it get released dripped into the coffee cup so the only time that hot liquid come into contact with any form of plastic is this small piece of grey plastic based on this do you happen to sell any model where the heated liquid only pass through metal component piping,hi bp i reached out to delonghi with your question and received this response hello the water doe not touch plastic after leaving the water tank in term of the milk assembly the milk touch that plastic tube obviously but the internal passage way are aluminum,hello thanks for this video i want to ask can i make just hot milk,yes,how close is the espresso and cappuccino to the one served at coffee shop expressed in percentage,hi ihab thanks for the question a lot depends on the bean and the skill of the barista and those factor vary quite a bit by shop but you asked for percentage so i will try and quantify based on my experience in my area i estimate with good bean the espresso is a good a about 60percent of the cafe i have been to i do not frequent place like starbucks much but the vast majority of their location use super automatic machine to make espresso the 40percent that is better is the result of baristas with knowledge and skill the 40percent may be a a little generous in a random sample of cafe a i tend to go to place where i know i will get it done right typically a micro roaster with an in house cafe that is more focused on espresso coffee than drip style a for cappuccino the eletta doe a very good job a capp is the easiest beverage for this type of machine a the froth is airier than a latte and frothing for a latte is more difficult for machine or barista than for a capp hope that help,hi i have the ecam45760b and i noticed that the drip tray is filling fast from the back left corner during a standard coffee is made i measured the water in the tray after 1 standard coffee and i have about 25ml of water that is left in the tray per coffee i always keep a cup under the sprout and even when i look under during a rinse when it is turn off i have another large amount of water filling the tray it is a new machine would that be an issue,interesting a most all machine do i do not have an eletta available at the moment to check if you are concerned i would contact jura customer support,my concern is i went to a store and check with the a salesperson and their demo unit did not drop any water during a coffee shot otherwise i would not stress would wonder if you eletta top doe the same thing maybe they change component and the one in store look like the first line and they had it in demo for a long ime thanks for the quick response,hi cc super automatic machine all drain a bit of water to the internal drip tray after making a coffee some more than others but 25ml is not out of the ordinary,tetszik,on the video you are using the plus or top ecam what is the difference anyways besides 50euros in price de longhi eletta plus ecam 44 620 s de longhi eletta top ecam 45 366 b,hi paris thanks for the question unfortunately i have not personally used the model you reference they may be version for eu market not available in the u,i know this thread is old but would like to know if one can use the machine without the water filter,hi and thank you for the explanation appreciate it a lot we have our own filtering system which we use for drinking water and current espresso machine also delonghi it take away the chlorine and softens the water even though we have very soft water to begin with we also boil the water 15 minute before cooling and filtering just wanted to know if i would be forced to buy the filter every so often to make the machine work,i eva this machine can be used without a water filter but it is not advised the filter do 2 thing first they contain carbon to remove chlorine that help improve flavor and also prevents the formation of hydrochloric acid heating water containing chlorine creates the acid which in turn can cause corrosion of internal component not a big deal if it happens once in awhile but use without a filter for long duration and this could cause a problem second filter soften the water reduce the mineral level to prevent scale buildup when water is heated if mineral are above a certain level scale will form these machine use thermoblock boiler with narrow passage in which water is heated scale build up in those passage will eventually effect machine performance and if allowed to build up over long period premature machine failure all that said if you happen to have an un chlorinated water supply that is soft low in mineral you can get away without using a water filter,hello how can i make the milk hot it is not hot at all,yo will never make it hot with this machine,dear sir i have a questionthis eletta cappuccino v primadonna s deluxe witch one is better i see with eletta is possible to make an espresso macchiato i love it and seems like is not possible to make in automatic with primadonna is true thx in advance regard,ok thx a lot for your fast reply you are great,hi salvatore fairly certain you can not make an espresso macchiato in automatic one touch mode on either machine i believe both machine steam milk first and then brew espresso into the milk so a latte macchiato no problem but do not think they will go the other way around,how do i make a hotter long black it not hot enough for me,the machine make cold coffee and froth cold milk and should not be sold ha a hot drink machine,hi paul assuming you set the machine to max brewing temp other suggestion is to pre heat cup you are brewing into a cold cup can quickly drop the temp of the coffee 10 20f,do you recommend this machine or prime donna for small coffee shop any other recommendation,hi npng neither of the machine you inquired about are rated for use in a coffee shop environment it depends a lot on local code but neither have certification like nsf etc for commercial use the lowest cost machine that may be allowable depending on local code is the jura impressa xs90 understand it is not really a commercial machine but can service a heavier load for true automatic commercial machine you can find a bunch here,i have this machine and feel that temperature is too low at highest temperature setting regular coffee only get a high a 147 2 fahrenheit,whole latte love i mostly use extra long long coffee cupwarmer is really a gimic because it doe not get special warm and it take 30 45min before cup start to get lukewarm if i preheat thick ceramic cup with teawater from the machine temperature for extra long coffee get up to 154 8f hot water get up to 156 5f,hi that temperature seems on the low side so a few question what size regular coffee are you making and what type of cup are you using the machine is cup warming feature cold cup especially thick ceramic will quickly cool coffee by a much a 20 degree depending on ambient condition in most case these machine brew internally at 195 200f a coffee flow thru the machine it cool some but most machine should deliver coffee coming out the spout in 170 range scale buildup in the thermoblock boiler can effect heating performance over time so critical to stay on top of descaling maintenance,hi mark thank you much for a great review i know this model ha great feature whereas jura ena 9 is a simple smaller unit i am in love with both which one is more durable it seems like may be jura might be simpler and more durable would you say the same thing thanks,thank you,hi tl you are welcome i have a preference for jura had a ena micro 9 in the studio for more than a year a my daily machine when not doing semi auto espresso i do like the elegant design of jura it wa rock solid for the time i had it if you go jura be sure and do the cleaning tablet maintenance a recommended by jura a it brew group is not removable for cleaning one other thing if you like milk based drink the delonghi doe have adjustable froth density on the carafe with the jura it is one froth style only,hi i wa considering buying this one but i see that eletta 44 660 b is much cheaper but ha pretty much exactly the same feature which one would you recommend going to their homepage i can see 2 difference extra cappuccino device water filter i do not think water filter is a huge bonus but i do not know what the extra cappuccino device is to be honest been googling around but can not fine anyone showing it anyhow why would i pay the extra 3 300euro for this over the eletta 44 660 please help,that is something i am desperately trying to find out a well what is the difference between the 2 eletta model and what is extra cappucino device,thank you for the reply these two model came out almost the same time 2014 and are listen on both sweden and international page there is almost 200 euro price difference what i like about the top is the metal finish and the button but good to know that functionality is the same do you know what extra cappuccino device refers to also i noted something strange the picture from your link do not look like the model you are testing there is no top on the machine from the link is that the wrong picture,hi mr on delonghi is u website both have the same list price we do not carry the 44 660 so not entirely certain a to the reason for the difference in price in eu eletta in this video is the 45 760 b my guess is the 44 660 b is an earlier version of the machine it may be offered at a lower price to clear out inventory with the exception of the extra you mention the machine most likely operate identically,hi how will you compare this with gaggia anima prestige,hi willie here is a link to a side by side spec comparison of the eletta to the anima prestige one glaring difference is the price eletta is nearly double the anima eletta ha deeper program ability more drink option and adjustable milk froth,better this or saeco hd8917,this one is a more capable machine than the saeco,hi this might be a silly question but how good is this machine with making hot chocolate i am planning on buying this machine for the family and although it will be mainly used for making coffee the younger one might be interested in using it to make hot chocolate if someone could reply back to me and let me know that would be great thanks,i have an offer both primadonna x de luxe etam 36 365 m amp eletta cappuccino top ecam 45 760 w both have the same price which is better,night93 no problem there is also this video which compare the prima donna to a couple of jura machine link,ooo thanks for the quick response i will check it out,hi if big into hot chocolate you might want to consider this machine it come with a separate carafe with a mixing function for making hot chocolate you can use milk froth from the eletta to make a hot chocolate by adding powder or syrup to the froth to see the chocolate mixing of the prima donna check out this video,mark i currently have a gaggia accademia and the problem i keep having is with the milk carafe lid handle breaking due to being made of cheap plastic and requiring the spout to constantly turning all the time is this an issue with the delongi eletta,hi michael sorry you had that happen with the accademia carafe i know the little black plastic receiver in the top of the handle can pop up and impede the closing of the handle have to be careful with that but i am a fan of the accademia is auto cleaning when closing the handle and the cleaning residue ending up in the drip tray anyway the carafe on the eletta ha some plastic a well but do not think you would have any issue like you describe one thing to keep in mind is the milk foam density is a manual adjustment with the carafe dial a opposed to a programmable adjustment on the accademia,hey loving your review i am currently a owner of a nespresso clix but it ha busted and i am looking at either the ecam45 760 or the barrista express how do these 2 compare and which should i choose,leigh martin,hi thanks for your comment and question see below for a link to a side by side spec comparison of the eletta and barista express so the delonghi is a super automatic and the breville is a semi auto big difference in using these machine with the breville being much more hand on and requiring more skill on the part of the user with skill you will be able to produce better espresso and milk froth with the breville with the delonghi all it take is a single button push to make a milk based espresso beverage so the delonghi offer convenience while the breville offer higher drink quality both machine are mass produced and better classified a appliance that is true of all super automatic machine and very few semi auto once you get to a price level above entry level in semi auto most all of them with the exception of breville is are built by hand what breville ha done is packed a lot of desirable feature found on more expensive and more robustly constructed semi auto machine into a lower cost factory assembled appliance hope that help in your decision really come down to if you prefer convenience or potentially higher drink quality,i have this same model in white brilliant,hi russel thanks for your comment eletta is a very nice machine especially like the ability to adjust the froth density,would you recommend the eletta over gaggia accademia amp which one of these two produce a hotter coffee,hi ahmed here is a link to a side by side spec comparison of the eletta and accademia a few key thing to consider comparing the 2 machine first temperature of coffee is essentially the same between the 2 they both have milk carafe the eletta us a dial to adjust froth density from the carafe the accademia ha adjustable froth density but you choose from 3 level in a menu to adjust both have steam wand but the accademia is a manual wand while the eletta is is an autofrothing wand the elettta is wand doe a nice job getting a fine texture but you will have more control some skill required with the accademia is to the point of doing milk definitely capable of pouring for latte art the accademia ha more metal on the case a little more solid in construction also more spout clearance for say a taller travel mug with accademia i use the accademia nearly everyday so i am a little biased perhaps one of my favorite feature on it is the sps flow control dial near the spout i often switch between doing espresso and long coffee into a taller travel mug that dial make a huge difference in the extraction reduce the flow rate for espresso and increase for long coffee to ovoid over extraction the eletta doe the pulse brewing for more of a drip style coffee but it take a while and 2 grind cycle to make a large cup i am fine with the longer coffee which come a lot faster on the accademia hope this all help i know it can be a tough choice let me know if you have any more question and i will do my bet to get you the answer,hey guy nice vid can you compared breville barista and gaggia classic i just bought the breville and iam not impressed can you convince me to buy the gaggia classic please thanks,it definitely ha the potential to produce better shot generally agreed that semi auto can make better espresso than super auto they give you much more control over brewing parameter of course that potential requires a level of knowledge and skill on the part of the user we do not think a pressure gauge is a must for producing good shot it can help let you know if you are way off like indicating channeling thru the coffee puck shot appearance timing and flavor are more important in our view than nailing a certain mark on a pressure gauge,taekwondochungdokwan lol it true looking gauge but sadly i just returned mine and bought gaggia classic aiming for silvia next year if iam not happy with gaggia one thing i do not like about barista it that built in grinder but that is other topic,hi marc do you think the gaggia classic would likely produce better espresso then the delonghi eletta reviewed here a to the rest of your comment i have the breville barista express bes870xl and looked into the gaggia classic among many other with help from your video i can still return the barista express but i do like the machine however seems we are always chasing the better espresso shot what sold me on the barista express is the pressure gauge adjustable brew temperature and not having to temperature surf deal with the switch over hassle of the classic and of course the appearance can not beat it on the counter v the classic i think having a pressure gauge is a must have in order to dial in and pull a consistently good espresso shot am i wrong about that you think,hi thanks for your comment here is a side by side spec comparison of those machine some thought on them the breville us a smaller pf at 54mm while the classic ha commercial standard heavyweight 58mm with the classic you will of course want a grinder a well interestingly we like the breville smart grinder pro a an economical companion to the classic you will probably be able to pull better shot with a separate grinder the 16 grind setting on the baristas built in grinder can be limiting like other breville product the sgp is considered by some a more of an appliance a opposed to a machine but should be fine for le demanding home use the classic is machine grade v the b barista appliance the classic is user serviceable if you are so inclined we generally do not recommend breville owner go inside the case another big difference is steaming it is autofrothing on the classic and commercial style manual on the breville it is tough to get a latte art capable microfoam with an autofrothing wand but the breville is not exactly a steaming powerhouse when compared to prosumer level hx and db machine both machine are single boiler sbdu so there is waiting for steam with both and manual cooling down required on the classic after steaming but we prefer the classic is boiler which contains a volume of water over the breville is thermocoil which is an on demand system with some practice and proper use the classic probably ha better temperature stability in the end the classic should produce better espresso when paired with a good grinder and user skill the breville doe okay but trade off some potential quality for ease of use hope that help let u know if you have any more question,i bought it 2 month ago i am impressed about the quality of the product,how is your machine today im interested in buy it do you recommend it,whotta shape very nice very nice this is best delonghi after primadonna 6600,hi pete it can do 2 double back to back no problem you do have other option like the low pressure pulse brewed long coffee or you can program an espresso to deliver more liquid volume which you prefer is up to your taste preference we do advise when pulling more volume with espresso process brewing that you adjust the grind coarser to avoid over extraction you will definitely save time and money over dollarbucks depending on the coffee you use a double espresso run about 20 cent in bean,is this a good device if i wanted to brew 4 shot americanos or something closely equivalent into a large cup it seems this device will pull two shot so can it do another 2 fairly quickly or is this long option a good alternative to americanos in your opinion my wife and i both drink them in the morning want something quick and easy w o the added expense time of stopping at starbucks every morning but i also would like to make the occasional milk based drink,we agree it is a very nice super automatic machine

7,dearly love to know how a test mode could be performed on this machine ta,if you had to chose between dinamica plus and elleta which one would you choose elleta is 750 euro in my country and dinamica plus i get for 550 euro tnx for answer,witch machine is better eletta capuchin top or primadona x,thank you,can you tell me more information on the difference between the milk menu on both thank you,dear hcs i am in the process of purchasing the primadonna class however i am confided which model to buy i have got the option to buy ecam550 55sb black plastic v ecam550 75 m metal silver there is a price difference i really want to know the difference between the two model have not found it precisely comprehensively anywhere,hi a question for you i just bought the new eletta evo after playing with the setting i found out that it doesnt have the cup warmer system the eletta top is a 179 usd premium over the evo here where i live is it worth the premium,cihad ozturk thanks for the reply good to know that we have the plus model even though i do not see that word on the box just purchased 3 day ago,randallsguaranteedsold hello if it a regular eletta evo them im sure it doe not i believe thats yours may be the eletta evo plus,hello our eletta cappuccino evo ha the cup warmer on the top of the unit also one of the biggest reason we bought that unit wa because of the fully automatic nature oh and the price on sale,hi cihad i am not familiar with the evo personally since it is not sold in canada where we are based that being said i would say that the cup warming is one of the essential and valuable thing about the eletta machine and would absolutely be worth the extra fund you can program your machine to turn on in the morning prior to waking up and can lead to substantially hotter beverage hope this help liam,best review,could the new eletta make ice coffee,can i make an americano with both machine,to quickly answer your question yes you will just need to brew a standard espresso shot and add hot water from the spout that being said the hot water spout is not located under the brewing spout and so you will need to shift the glass there is not a pre programmed americano function unfortunately liam,what is the better one eletta top ecam45760s or dinamica ecam35075si,ah good question both of these model are extremely similar and each have their own advantage so it will depend on your personal preference reason to buy the dinamica lattecrema ecam35075si ice coffee function more customization and fine tuning for various beverage reason to buy the eletta cappuccino top ecam45760s much hotter and programable cup warmer with a dedicated heating element larger bean hopper and water reservoir two frothing system fully automatic lattecrema system or manual frothing wand we would recommend the eletta ecam45760s for the size of the water reservoir and having the option for the manual frothing wand,could you please give the model of each,home coffee solution much thanks,ecam44660b eletta cappuccino amp eletta cappuccino top ecam45760s,i bought the eletta top 2 week back from a clearance sale it brand new but the bean hopper and inside of the grinder is dusty what is the best way to clean that part of the machine i am more concerned about the part of the grinder i can not see that may be full of dust,rashad ishak where you bought it,good question we would recommend purchasing urnex grinder cleaner for super automatic machine,thanks for the review confusingt with all these eletta model,very happy to help and glad to hear,i have been trying to decide between the 2 and now finally know the difference between them thanks,most welcome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,nice video for 1st time user,not hot at all make luke warm drink,hello how descale this machine,really an important video must see,any difference between eletta and autentica thx,can you do one for eletta top,hmmm too hot most people complain that it is too cold so that is good right,every coffee i make with mine taste the same no matter what bean i use,hi really enjoy your video what is the height on this machine read different spec on different site thanks,on sale costco com for june dollar1 100,thanks for video is it good for cafe that make 10 15 coffee in a day,how do you descale it,descaling,just ordered my de longhi eletta cappuccino ecam45 760b thanks for the youtube,hi can you give u your feedback,the taste menu what is amount that grind inside it,this review is not correct many of the other drink are also programmable cappuccino drink in the milk menu and the long it is not just my coffee they are set to a default amount from the factory but you can program the amount of milk and espresso and it will remember the amount if you want to change them the long is a cool drink it is a low pressure espresso about 3 4 bar to resemble more of a drip style coffee,nice information do you know the coffee dose range in this machine or delonghi in general,hi which of these machine do you recommend most of model arent available in my country these are the best i can find for my money delonghi eletta cappuccino top ecam 45 760 w delonghi esam6600 primadonna siemens ti903209rw eq 9 s300,great video thanks for posting where did you get that awesome double walled coffee cup from,you can find it at any delonghi coffee shop or dealer,how do i get spout off,hello this machine or a saeco incan noto,at 6 15 in the video i have noticed there is no filter in the water reservoir is it ok to do so or is the filter necessary,fantastic video thank you,great video i am choosing between eletta 44 660 b or eletta 45 760 which one would you recommend and why they seem sooooo similar,ycheon i think the 45769 ha a second boiler dedicated to the milk hot water function which also explains the price difference,i went with 44 660 which is cheaper the difference i spotted are 1 appearance amp different button 2 manual froth steam function from the hot water spout only available at 45760 3 enable disable cup warmer at 45760 always enabled at 44660,alex k which model did you buy i am also trying to choose between 44 660 and 45 760 thanks,same here trying to decide between these two model did you decide which one to get,major rex hi which coffee machine did you decide to go with i am also torn between the same two machine,struggling between this one and gaggia anima prestige,thats my problem too,hi there great review any chance for reviewing the new delonghi 350 75 dinamica thanks,gail how many coffee is a day would you drink kind regard from down under,one or two or four d,so this machine would be more of a personal espresso machine,you got it,i purchased that machine the newer version white and i am so so satisfied i really recommend it i set grinder at point 1 i use a strong blend caff borbone enjoy your machine,are there any superautomatic machine out there with better grind quality than some others i think that poor grind quality on many superautomatics is the reason i have really never liked the coffee they make,avoiding oily and flavored bean is restrictive are there some machine that do better than others with those kind of bean also plastic is a great material the way you say it it sound like plastic is bad,do not be condescending to me you are telling me starbucks french roast which helped them conquer the world is beneath you gim me a break,why not plastic is precious resin consider the aeropress which is extremely beloved i think i remember gail saying in one video that she think it should be a standard in the kitchen for everyone who enjoys coffee a major virtue of plastic is that it doe not transfer heat a fast a metal doe coffee is often served not quite hot enough at least in the usa perhaps we need more plastic,commercial coffee shop like peet is and starbucks like to over roast their bean shinny bean do not mean tastier actually medium roast bean have more caffeine then dark roast and you can taste more nuanced flavor if there are not local roaster near you try a coffee subscription from scg or elsewhere and you can always add syrup for flavor after brewing good luck,new video every week subscribe over 100 crew review watch visit u online thanks for watching all our video folk you are the best,i have been using this machine for a year now i can not say i like the foam it make there is just something that is off about it it good for making a fast caffeine bomb on a work morning but i would appreciate a separate steam arm that could be put in place of the milk container there is a separate hot water arm that attache to it milk is not hot enough for hot chocolate and at least on my machine the hottest coffee setting is not that hot my milk container is also annoyingly difficult to put on and out i literally have to hold the machine when pushing and be scared of breaking it when pulling the espresso it make is good and the grind brew unit ha not clogged up once i tried looking up the espresso dos it us but i could not find anything so you just have to experiment with the strength setting personally i find a huge difference in the order which the drink is prepared cappuccino is my drink of choice the cappuccino mode make the milk first and then the espresso and it end up tasting watery so i always brew the espresso first and then use the milk setting manually,thanks for the comment great trick a well with the cappuccino we will have to give this a try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,entertaining and educational video for using my new delonghi expresso,you doe not explain how save my coffee and other setting like temperature etc so not very helpfull,eletta or autentica which better,how do you descale it please,there is a descale option on the menu and you would need to purchase some descaler cleaner,this or the ecam22 360,why are you speeding up the viedo you prick we want to hear what you are saying,hi that wa a great review i am looking to move from a delonghi nespresso lattissima to a bean to cup machine the main reason for this is the lattissima like most pod machine doe not make the drink hot enough i have been onto nespresso and their machine are calibrated to dispense drink at 65c which for me is not hot enough doe this delonghi have a temperature setting to adjust dispense temp also are the drink hot when you use the milk frother dispenser thanks joff,joff hall hi yes there is a temperature setting the milk also is hot when making latte is cappuccino is etc the hot water feature is good but not a hot a freshly boiled water if you like your coffee hot hot then adding boiling water is best hope that help,this would have been a great review if it wa not for the annoying pitch change,dean norsworthy it is an amateur video thing can only improve thanks for the feedback,hello im thinking about buying this machine any letdown i should worry about also can you please tell me what is maximum water capacity for cup when u make coffee,tycez no but heard of it like de longhi and have used them for year one thing i will say is if you buy one get good coffee bean total game changer,great to hear did you check out the gaggia anima prestige any opinion on that,tycez i love it and use it everyday,product review gb not big problem imo you can request 2 cup of latte cappuccino instead of one if your cup is too large seems like quite a solid product,pliaga22 machine is amazing but not great at making large sized latte or cappuccino a cup need to be placed under the milk creamer when cleaning and drop tray fill up quick you can also create your own sized coffee in amy coffee setting meaning you can have a short coffee or extra large coffee,yeah still all good i descale regularly and replace the filter when needed,how to descale plz,hi is the machine still working like it should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,i like almost everything about this brewer my previous one wa a keurig 2 0 mybest kitchen and had a lot of issue this one is more basic but all the important feature are there if i had to name something i found a a negative it would be the size of the water tank i wa used to a larger one and have to fill this one daily a we drink 4 large cup every morning but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of thing,best review ever,wow thank you so much for the best comment,,acabo de comprarla espero no arrepentirme lt 3 gracias por su video,thank you for your kind comment i hope you enjoy your machine,typical husband not listening lol how many time did you say latte i have this machine coming so excited,lol thank you for your comment i hope that you have fun with your machine,i just bought this machine so far so good,have fun,i would like a lette please ohh a standard coffee two old dafties dealing with technology hope coffee machine still alive nice coffee machine enjoy it,coffee machine is still alive and well thank you at 68 robert dosn t think he is old pleased you like it happy holiday,hello guy i bought it exactly same coffe machine 8 month ago for couple time i use it but yesterday after month when turn on it try to get cappuccino is going like preparation underway is stop late flat white milk menu still same anyone know what is the problem thanks,hope you got your machine sorted,i have been using it since october 2019 after my krups fully automatic machine retired amazing fully automatic coffee machine i am so happy and never had any problem enjoy yours too hint do not use any dark roast or oily bean will cause the burr grinder jam in most fully automatic machine,thanks for the info,it is been an awful machine for me been already three time for repair and delonghi service department have no idea what to do with it i hope you gon na enjoy yours more than i do,mohd fahim abd rahman my milk it coming out not hot,p,lee ball it is cappuccino top,it look like you have got the cappuccino and not the cappuccino top ivaylo i hope you are able to get it sorted soon though,mohd fahim abd rahman can not make normal coffee no cream on the top the taste is like a hot water if you make a milk base drink you can not feel the coffee at all and i did try all the setting from 1 to 10 and from 10 to 1 with many different coffee brand delonghi had been absolutely useless not only that they can not fix it but every time i got the machine back from them something is broken like the second time the top panel could be lifted up about 1cm they fixed that but now the on off button which use to be flat with the front panel is about 3mm below the level of the panel all that only show that there is no quality control at all i will make a video about that a i want this to be seen from a many people a possible and if i can help one person not to buy delonghi product i will be happy,hey glad to see you guy are having fun with your machine i love our machine too btw i did not see a filter when you filled the water tank did you add a filter if the water in your area is so hard i would put a filter on there for sure it should help your machine last longer and not sure but it might make the coffee taste better too happy latte gk,lee ball we are using a filter in the machine and the coffee is good thank you,deirdre harness if your water is a hard a it seems i would use the filter or you can get a separate filter to filter your water before you put it into the machine that might work out cheaper seems expensive but if your kettle is getting scale on it currently imagine what the inside of your expensive coffee machine will get like,hi thank you for you comment from the instruction book we understood that if we put a filter in it would cost gbp10 00 for 2 month of use if we didn t use the machine for a week or two then the filter would only last 3 week it seems a bit expensive but i will try a filter to see if it taste better thank you for your advice,i use a mix of specially sourced whole milk and cream in my milk frother of course you want to put it in the freezer for a while right before use it is good to use really chilled milk now after having one of these machine i have been sourcing coffee bean from all over the globe just because these machine are so simple and fun to use gon na start collecting cocoa powder for my mocha drink and getting a vitamix 750 pro blender to make frappuccinos with espresso shot,mohd fahim abd rahman for mocha i just use cocoa powder but if you are not lazy you can make syrup using cocoa powder a it will mix a little bit better and more easily compared to powder i personally just add the cocoa and sugar to my warm frothy milk in my cup and i stir it all in before i let the machine add
