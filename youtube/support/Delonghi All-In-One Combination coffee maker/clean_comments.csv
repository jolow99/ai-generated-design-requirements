0,hi is the tamper is size 51mm,hello when will the product go on sale in turkey do you have any information where can i order it,thanks for the review i am gon na buy it,hey is there a specific brand of pod i should buy,can you use normal dust coffeee on this machine,thanks,do you have to manually turn off the espresso,this doe not really tell me how to use the machine because you would not read the direction before using it i had to find another viewer to explain and let me know what the machine can and can not do well good first attempt but you need to do your homework before presenting to make this really useful for someone buying or opening the machine for the first time making a second video where you actually show proper use and give feedback would up your game,i laughed so hard when you poured the water everywhere except the machine still great video,the back end of the funky scooper is your tamper also looked like you did not cycle some water through first before making your first cup i definitely would put some clean water through that thing before making coffee i think i will pick up one of these tomorrow to replace my leaking ninja coffee maker thanks for the video,i love the commitment on that water pour haha,hahah this wa a very enjoyable review thanks for the laugh and the info,anybody know how long it take to brew a single cup,the coffee side minimum is 3 cup and take 5 minute to heat brew and land in the carafe if you mean the espresso side it take a couple min to heat the water via the top button then le than a minute to pull the shot if you overload the ground or tamp it to much then the machine can not push the water through and it just drip so it will take forever,a someone who life in a 600ft apartment in an urban neighborhood what you said at 3 30 nail my predicament i just do not have the space for more than 1 machine,is it still running,hi just a quick feedback if you are going to post a review of the machine you should have figured out how it work and put in some experience mileage that way so when you hit record you are showing u a well thought out perspective of how it actually work versus pressing button to see what it doe in your review video hope that is helpful aside from that love the video,como sabes cuando parar para que deje de salir cafe,1 33 the tamper is on the other end of the scoop,thanks again pyrex,my froth spill water instead,i love this video so much,what is going on if it leak the water on the coffee side i put 6 cup water and it only brewed 4 and spill 2 cup,good music good point on indicating stopping by pressing the button thanks for the video,brother it is espresso,is there a way to turn off the espresso side without unplugging my week old com 350 m is staying hot on the that side even when the on off indicator light is off the top of the unit stay very warm over 100 degree f a is the metal plate underneath where the espresso filter get attached is there a standby mode that i may have missed thanks,can you froth while the espesso pull,such a guy not reading a manuel,expreso jesus,nice video,thanks,funny review helpful though please learn to pronounce espresso it is not an expresso d,on the espresso on off is it suppose to flash once it is done warming up or flash immediately then stop when it is ready i read the manual but it is not specific i hope my machine is not broke that would suck any help would be awesome thanks,the tamper is on the tablespoon scoop,logan dunning no,check the comment,it a permanent filter or paper filter needed,logan can you consider suggest this coffe maker to begginers,the tamper is on the end of the scoop,sir sugar and milk,the spoon can be used a a tamper the flat bottom part is for that great review,how hot is the coffee,i know,just bought my machine and wa about to post where to locate the tamper lol,do you descale your machine when you first get it or just when the orange light come on after some time thanks,john di cesare yes i did and yes,hi did you purchase this machine doe it make hot espresso,logan dunning thank you and i feel that lol,a couple month after it come on once it is on for a long enough time that it annoys me,thanks for review i am buying one now,fantastic if you use the link in the description i get a small commission that would be amazing if not no worry i hope you enjoy it a much a we do,the tamper is on the end of the scoop,oh really i am so silly did you know that you are the first want one comment this thank you so much,the tamper is on the other side of the scoop that came with the machine lol enjoy,happy to help i am happy to receive your kind support,ahhh sarcasm i love it i had not read the comment below before posting my comment love your video review and this machine thanks lol,did you know that you are the first person to mention this thanks,tamper on opposite end of scoop,yes a updated in the description several minute after posting the video about a year ago,great vid love your energy just so you know you can use the base of the spoon a tamper,,what is the descale kit do you use that before using the machine and how do you use it thanks,delonghi ha this included descaling juice and instruction included in the manual hope that help,i just got my and this video really help,fantastic happy to help,what an idgit the help i needed wa not covered like using the frother,just got this and same happened to me with frother leaking water,i have had quite the trouble with the frother it is constantly either get plugged or just stop working i have call the company i have had 3 machine and they all do the same i am pretty sure i am not cleaning it enough or how it should be do you have any advise,the only thing i can think of is perhaps if the company ha replaced it three time maybe reach out to them for a different machine i know that is not the best answer but that is the best i can think of for now hope you have a good night,you only reviewed 1 3 of the machine need to see the drip brew and the frothier at work please what you did do wa enjoyable just would have liked to see it all,will do next time,hi seems like a great machine i see this review wa made in 2020 we are now april 2021 do you still love this machine any problem i would like to buy if you still give it a thumb up,yes it is still good it is honestly great for fresh ground coffee and for a full pot plus delonghi and nespresso are awesome hope that help,5 00 thats so true,thanks,doe steam come out from the top when it is brewing just wondering a i want to put it under my counter but do not want to ruin my shelf,yes a little,to change time from military time 24 hr to 12 hr just press and hold min button,perfect thanks,i drink both coffee style but drip coffee is my daily driver however having a good expresso is a good option to have from time to time i never really owned a expresso machine only the old school type u make on a stove top lol since looking at machine i noticed there are some that seem very novice and others that are for the enthusiast that are well north of dollar1k my question is i am obviously a beginner but want to learn and make good coffee this combo seems fantastic because my drip just broke and having the ability to make both style in a nice sleek compact machine is a no brainer but is it worth it is the expresso too complex for a beginner or perhaps the opposite is it worthy of competing with the big dawgs i do not want to get it and then feel like i need to upgrade to a more sophisticated machine in a few month thought also great video informative and comical i too am no bean head lol,i am here watching this video because my 20 year old black amp decker drip machine just broke on me this morning it is time for an upgrade merry christmas to me lol,great comment yes this is a perfect entry level to do both drip and expresso the only thing after getting this machine is pick up a good bur grinder then find a local roaster then you are living pretty close to coffee heaven thanks have a great day,thanks this is exactly the kind of machine i wa looking for,fantastic hope you enjoy i love it a lot,the pyrex spout dead,,5 25 you are welcome,thanks,anyone know how to set the clock from military time 24hr to 12 hr time,if you figure it out please let me know,logan have you had to descale the drip side yet i have and the bold button is still flashing wonder if you have done this yet or if you have not can you do a video thanks,logan dunning you sir is an excellent friend,that is a great idea and going forward i am going to make d scaling video for all of my coffee machine review unfortunately this unit i have given to a friend but going forward i will definitely make d scaling video to help best of luck if you figure it out please post the resolution so other people can benefit from your investigation,how do you descale this thing i followed the instruction but the bold light is still flashing after any idea i can not seem to find a video on youtube about it,michael ciano did you figure this out just read this comment after filling the machine with descaler and now annoyed lol,i know the customer service team is very helpful thank you amp hope you have a great day,michael ciano it did not did not seem to wan na work a the manual said,i am going through the same issue and looking for a video a well when you held the on off button did it blink when you held for 6 second,you learn how i learn trial and error,,look phenomenal the only thing i am worried about is the size what if it take too much space on my countertop,it is slightly large correct thank you amp hope you have a great day,the water i have a cheap dollar20 coffee maker and i get that same spill every morning i am looking to upgrade so hopefully this is the machine i am looking for,enjoy,thanks for sharing that is the coffee machine that i wa looking for,you are so welcome,i am finally getting a real machine had stupid tassimo forever now i gave wife 5 option and 30 min later i get email notification of purchase sweet she just picked a delonghi combo main reason for watching wa to see if tamper amp frother cup included funny how u missed it on end of scoop i would prob do same if i had not seen that exact tool on a previous video hopefully i can figure this world of coffee amp espresso out thanks for video,can you program the espresso part sorry if this is a dumb question new here,logan dunning thank you so much have a great day a well,it is a really good question actually yes you can if you pre load up the night before if you are looking to schedule it let me know if you have any further question i can help with and hope you have a great day,i love how to said forget the manual amp start pushing button amp your water pouring skill loved it amp totally relatable,these combo machine have been around for decade had my first one in the mid 90 is and if you had read the manual you would have found out that you need to wait for the machine to heat up a indicated when the power light stop flashing would have made a much better cup of espresso,i do this every time much more fun,thanks i love to have fun with these review,you can tamper with the flat side of the scoop idk if thats what it actually for but thats what i do,logan dunning yes i wrote too soon before saw other comment hahaha everyday we learn new thing about ourselves,yeah thank you i appreciate it you are the 10th person that is it let me know how silly i am i did update the description with this information i appreciate your help,the espresso water reservoir pull out so you can fill it from your tap tamp is also on spoon tool,yeah how could you miss that hehe surprised you did not taste the coffee first

time i try to turn on the espresso maker it leak water everywhere out of the seal anyone have any idea,maybe contact customer service to troubleshoot hopefully that help,well i think someone mentioned it but the tamper is definitely on the opposite end of the spoon you literally touched it lol not making fun maybe a little seriously though great review the wife and i are looking at replacing the keurig and i wanted an all in one and this look like one of the only real option out there and very affordable so of course i go to yt for review very good review very likely will end up getting this machine thank you,yes i am quite knowledge sometimes and sometimes completely daft make the review fun ya it is a good machine thanks for the kind word,the tamp is on the other end of the scooper,oh sorry great video i did read lol and just wanted to help should have read the comment too take care,yes i know multiple people have corrected and i have updated the description thanks so much for the correction,you have to wait until the on off button stop blinking that mean the water is hot when it stop and then turn the 2nd button on because if you do not wait your coffee will be water and that

brew a half pot of coffee thanks,yes this is correct thanks for the response nicholas thanks i appreciate your comment hope you have a merry xmas and happy new year,pour in the water to the amount you

description to include the link is that what you mean thanks i appreciate your comment hope you have a merry xmas and happy new year,how would you suggest to maximize extraction for a better espresso i am new to the self making coffee game it want to do it right the first time when is come to buying machine,logan dunning doe it make hot espresso,so far work incredibly well luckily have not run into any issue,logan dunning how is the machine holding up is the frothier leaking or anything i am on the fence on this machine after a some research,you can experiment with how fine grained the ground are and how much you pack down sometimes if you pack it down too much or put too much in the machine will not pour hope that help,i am figure this shit out,,whats the showerhead like on the coffee maker is it 1 little hole or is there numerous hole spread out to fully saturate a wide area of the coffee bean in the basket,ryan k perfect glad i could help,ben gooch yes i wa talking about

puck ha many many little hole that evenly distribute water if you are talking about the drip coffee side it is got 6 pea sized hole with which it run the water over the ground,the tamper is on the scoop,thanks i updated the description i am not the smartest tool in the shed,hi i just saw your video and your expresso came out perfect mine come out very watery nd the steamer doesnt work if it doesnt have water but now when i put the water i am getting so much water in my milk it end up all watery i feel so upset i do not know what am i doing wrong,remember that steam is water the more steam you run through the more watery it will get maybe start with heavier milk like full cream or half and half,did you read the manual that came with the machine it is actually super well detailed,maybe contact customer service for help and a possible replacement since it is a 2 year warranty,this wa the f ing coolest review i have ever seen you sir are my spirit animal and i am going

2,your demo wa way too fast and from many of the comment and the look of the manual this machine is a pain i have a bco430bc model and hoping i will not run into same issue might have to view other demo thanks for your effort anyway,it is the worst machine hate it with the vengeance,thank you it wa really nice to hear an honest and down to earth review i really appreciated it,glad it wa helpful sorry i forgot to mention that you should also press the steam button for the steamer to work better however only one of those function work heat up at a time ty,you need a little more experience with espresso machine there is actually nothing weird about this machine at all it is a great machine and easy to use,all throughout college i worked at a coffee shop so i do not need more experience this machine is obviously completely different from several thousand of dollar machine and a bit more complicated than a cheap stand alone espresso machine anyway now that i have had it for well over a year it is been pretty good just have to get a hang of the in and out,i think you overfilled the espresso maker with coffee that is why you had to tamp it down so hard to get it to fit the manual you should read it before doing a review say to tamp it lightly it also recommends using cold skim milk or 2percent i just bought this machine and the espresso maker is very noisy a loud vibration like there may a loose component inside i may return it and try another one,i hope you are able to switch it out so espresso should be tamped down pretty tightly at least with good machine a i mentioned i worked for many year at a coffee shop well before starbucks broke out and it should be tamped hard ty,you do not leave it til water run out lol you push the button to turn off when espresso is done i just learned this on another video,i am fine with the review including the criticism but it is not really fair to make a star 30 minute after unboxing there is a learning curve with everything new,i just bought the bco431 s i am using e s e pod but the espresso seems to be running very slow do i need another filter for the e s e pod,i love the strawberry shortcake mug,a thank you they are my pride and joy,you really have no idea how to use this machine you never turn the steam on to let it heat up a for the dip being un even is because of the way you packed it you should learn how to use a machine before you write the review,came to see a review and pick any spilled knowledge but only heard a whole bunch of attitude thanks for the video though,lol thanks so much,use the machine before reviewing man,that is not what i do here thx,you said that you worked at different type of coffee shop but can not push a steam button on the machine and expect the milk to froth the machine need to boil the water hotter for the frother to work you have a manual get started guide right there but making a video and complaining about a product that you have not finished reading this is wierd im taking this back type of user should not be sharing their video is online easily here is an idea read the manual set it up clean the machine 4 time test it out then make your video after you have correctly used the machine for youtubers that are watching video researching about product to upgrade to or online shop your video is very bad in showing the product itself a bad and just show how bad you are in uploading an informative video showing your mistake and low preparation standard,lol have a great day,she do not know how to use this machine and do not know how to do a cappuccino or late coffee,lol okay freddy,you should delete this video you made yourself look incompetent try reading the instruction first or having someone who actually know how to make expresso cappuccino before you start the video lmfao,vianneycreates i wa showing a friend this video because it is the first one i found i purchased this cappuccino coffee machine and it work perfectly fine that is why i am responding to the video why are you responding p s we also both laughed our as off because we thought it wa a comedy and if you look through the comment and see everyone else is response you will see i am not the only one,lol you cracked me up james please make your own perfect video i assume from your comment yours would be perfect not even sure why you are watching a video on the subject since you have so much expertise have a good one buddy,read the manual first before making a review video,too late,she is talking to much,thank you,i want to know how yo use the machine not how to make certain drink,maybe you can find another video to help you out,get to the point,never,talk to much,thank you,your knowledge is alarming or should i say your lack of knowledge people who purchase item just to test and have the intention to just return if you do not like something or a feature are the worst kind of person why would not you just read the feature of the machine to see if you would actually enjoy the item or if you should purchase a different model your completely abusing the store return policy what you have complained about in the video are all feature that are easily learned if you spent any time at all researching the product prior to purchase wow lady get your crap together your a mess thumb down and never watching again,vianneycreates perhaps read the comment again you might understand it a second go around,i have had this machine for over a year and use it daily so what wa your ill assuming comment about people just talking without knowing interesting,i just bought it and i hate it so much the espresso is awful,vianneycreates i finally understand how to use it i am getting better result thanks for the help,i am sorry to hear that this machine definitely ha limitation i would suggest making sure it is ready to make the espresso green light lit otherwise it will pump cold ish water through and it will be absolutely horrible,hi quick question about the base of the espresso side the one with the orange red thing poking out ours always get full with hot water after making a cup of espresso doe it happen to your machine too or is ours defective,vianneycreates oh okay guess i need to have it checked thank you for answering,so mine get full after a few week i do not know why it would fill up so quickly i do not know if that water is built up steam inside the machine or how it get there i think that is a little too fast but i do not know how long it take for you to actually make the espresso like if it stay on even though it is not actively making espresso it might still put out water i do not really know how the thing doe it thing,thank you for showing u how to use the machine,any time tysm,yeah u wa pretty disappointed in mine cause now it drip the shot and i have only used it 3 or 4 time before idk what to do,you need to wait until the frothing button light up,when twisting the sump onto the machine there is a little pointy black tab directly below where it say espresso and is where you line the handle up try lightly taping the sump to settle the ground before very lightly tamping them the cup probably filled unevenly because the ground were tamped to tightly i have this machine a a warranty replacement for it is predecessor bct330t it is seems more fidgety and not a straightforward i initially had issue with the regular brew side because it would warm the plate but not brew send water through if i had to buy another machine i would definitely pay more to get something much better most likely european designed german or italian and not made it china this machine is not worth what they charge for it,she is a lousy demes traitor and so dissy,thanks so much for explaining all this staying at a friend house and have no idea where the instruction even are,with the no auto off on espresso do you feel your coffee are strong how would one know when to shut it off i would not want my espresso getting too much water from the basin if you know what i mean sorry newbie espresso maker here,also did you mention that you can program it to make it ahead of time say put it on at night and it will brew in the morning,there is a trick you switch to milk mode in the mid part of the frothing and you get that melted ice cream paint texture instead of full bubble like this on this model try it out also always clean it straight away and push water thru it ocd,thanks for the tip i always wash my nozzle out too by basically frothing water for a minute or two lol i have always done that with any machine and it is never been an issue i had one lady ask how i clean it bc hers smell like a dead rat and i wanted to puke i can not imagine,ummm what type of water do we put in it hot or cold,just cold or room temp nothing special,we just got this machine second hand and the filter holder will not latch any troubleshooting here doe the receiver move with the holder it seems like there is no way to make it go straight out the front,vianneycreates the basket that hold the espresso ground will not attach to the boiler plate the way you show it it just slide in and you rotate it so the handle is straight out but you say it is tight we can line up the groove but it will not grip anything to stay up there and it is not pointing straight out i am wondering is the boiler plate metal receptor supposed to rotate,i am not sure i understand what you mean the basket that hold the espresso ground or the regular coffee side,hello how is this machine a year later so far i do not care for how it is performed on this video thanks,it is doing well it is not super convenient but still make a good cup we use it daily for the coffee maker maybe a few time a month for the espresso side,a lot of complainer in the comment for no reason thanks for this video my parent have trouble operating the expresso part of this machine because they did not read the instruction so i just wanted to learn how to do that,glad it helped tysm for your kind comment,do not blame the machine u just terrible reviewing it just sayin,yep that is the issue,34 19 to show how to make a cappucino oh you have to have 22 f g ad,have a great night,thank you for your great video i just have one question when do you make espresso with this machine doe any water come out from the hole under the cup,mine doe the same thing is that normal,horrible review,have u descaled it i can not figure out the decaling drip side,lol i got your other comment i have not descaled have not needed to yet,nevermind i got it lol,cappuccino is more of an airy dry coffee and latte is more wet,vianneycreates i didnt get this one because of the manual pour which wouldve been fine for me either way but i didnt want to have to time it out everytime but i got the calphalon temp iq espresso machine i just got it today and i got ta say that i really like it i got ta figure out an efficient way to use it but im excited i made a white chocolate mocha for my wife and she said it taste exactly like starbucks wcm,ty,pretty cool that your son worked at starbucks i used to work there people would tend to ask for me to make their drink it wa a really fun job,he liked it there too i mean he had his day but fun overall i worked at a local coffee shop when i wa in college too i loved it have a great day,i found this woman to be super annoying,you should read the whole instruction first it say make at least four cappuccino without using ground coffee and using water instead of milk make at least two carafe of coffee without using ground coffee,reading the instruction pay off sometimes,because you did not press the steam button in the front before frothing,read the manual next time you didnt push the steam button,hey if you want to up your espresso game get a scale i hope you are enjoying the new machine,tysm it is been pretty good,so should i buy it or not i want a coffee and espresso maker in one for le than 250,i got the same thing for 200 at target just a fyi,you talked through great detail which wa nice but did you read the instruction first if you press the steam button and do not use the frother until it is ready the steam will not shut off youre also supposed to put in about 6 oz of milk for 2 drink and then you will see you can froth it up to 12 oz the machine work great if you prep it and read the direction,can you use espresso pod with this machine williams sonoma told me you could,how do i make or set a cup of coffee without watching it overflow,vianneycreates yes coffee side,a cup of coffee like on the coffee side or espresso in a mug,i came to watch how to st the time,oh no i am sorry i stuck to drink making it is really easy though just hold down the hour button and keep pressing until you get to the hour you want then let it go and it will keep set same thing for the minute,hi i just bought this machine and i had some question doe water collect at the bottom of where the espresso cup go because when i did a test run with water water would collect at the bottom where the silver catcher plate it also do you still need to manually stop the espresso from brewing,vianneycreates okay thank you so much for clarifying do you think you can do an updated video where you show u how to do the espresso shot and use the steamer i am still trying to learn how the machine work but i am not getting it,so yes and yes if you look closely after removing the whole tray there is like a spout coming from the water reservoir area it drain into the tray why i do not know yes you have to stop the espresso from brewing so once your demitasse shot glass mug is at the level you need press the button again to turn it off,i just bought the gen two version of this machine so far my opinion is it is a piece of shit,which model number is the gen 2 i just bought the bco430bm and i can not wait to test it out,ok that made me giggle i think if it were a lower price point i can overlook the quirk of using it,you should have read the instruction before you made this video incredibly painful to watch,yes most people totally read all of the instruction before using something that is super typical tysm,dip the steamer in a cup of water then complains about water dripping off of it,ty for your astute observation,stop complaining,never,hola k bonita m quina de caf me acava de llegar mi delonghi puedes hacer un video en espa ol por favor,muchas gracias por pedir un video en espa ol pero no creo que lo podr a hacer sin o rme toda pocha jaja a ver que,funny video but have you ever used a real espresso machine to me it look like most of the problem you have is by your own mistake,you heard me say i worked at a coffee shop gloria jean for several year thank you for your astute observation,the video wa very interesting i enjoy espresso every day with delonghi is magnifica s i also subscribed to the channel please come visit me on my channel with love from japan,you are making this look so difficult it actually a very simple machine be smarter than the machine,ok,expresso coffee doe not work like a american coffee it supposed to be louder because of the pressure and suppose to be manual so you can choose between doble or single expresso or other way you want that is the way supposed to be,ok,thanks for the review i have this machine in order to froth the milk you have to press the button below the cappucino button to heat the element to frothing temperature when the light come on then you start frothing,vianneycreates what are your thought about the machine now after owning for a year,ty i know that now and added an addendum about just that in the description box soon after i uploaded the video,my nespresso is at at my other house in a different state for a month and i have had this delonghi for about two year and never bothered to use the espresso machine and now i am really craving a latte now i can actually understand what button to hit and where so thank you had a feeling if i went to the yt comment there would be a bunch of ridiculous people dialing in on oh you did not do it right lol of course yt comment never disappoint do not take it seriously and thank you again,oh wow thank you so much i am glad i wa able to help a bit,hola vianney did you keep it after all i have been thinking about getting this one but idk honestly,we have had it for over a year now use it every day we have gotten used to either making the espresso first and waiting to heat the milk or heating the milk first and then the espresso if you can swing a more expensive machine that can do both at the same time that is what i would do lol,so i am curious if you kept it and if you still like it,i did keep it and we are used to it now it make coffee well enough quickly enough just on the espresso side you have to choose if you want to make the espresso first or to froth the milk first either way something is waiting and cooling down in the meantime that is the only hang up i have but we do use it daily still working the same a ever,sigh no there is not an auto size for the espresso but it is 15 bar and give you flexibility also no need to calibrate also she doe not know how to use the steam function the button need to be pressed the button just under the espresso button just read the manual,vianneycreates well thats the thing you kept indicating how ineffective the machine is but it just like any other counter appliance espresso machine maybe they do not all work just like mr coffee but it not an inferior product,i used the info on the quick set up and i have added a note a far a pressing that god forsaken button in the description this video is more of a first impression a done by an educated stay at home mama i am not a professional reviewer and do not owe delonghi anything lol ty,you answered my question but i read the direction 1st saw everything coming i heated my milk in microwave because you said it wa not that hot but i do wish it wa hotter,that is a good idea so now that i have had this for a while i came to quickly realize you can only do one thing at a time so the espresso then the frothing or frothing first then the espresso either way something is cooling off while the other thing heat up,this machine is a headache,vianneycreates i really appreciate you pointing out that you are supposed to stop the espresso maker so the cup doe not overflow,it kinda is we have had it over a year now and it work great but it is kind of irritating that you can not make the espresso and foam at the same time got ta choose one to go first and i do not like my milk getting warm i like it piping hot but if you make the espresso first it begin to get old oh well,hey is there a way to use nepresso pod,not on this machine,thanks for the review i did not know espresso is so much different from regular coffee mine came out great,i just bought this machine to replace my krups with similar function this delonghi ha thinner lighter material my krups wa heavier after i read the manual over and over i tried each feature i love this i can schedule to make my coffee automatically so in the morning when i woke up my coffee is ready my krups could not do this all the espresso capability are similar to my krups and the milk frother is actually better my krups also did not stop automatically to make a single espresso or double overall i am impressed with this delonghi highly recommended,how did you schedule it to start for the morning,so great to hear i know what you mean about the material but after a year it is still going strong ty for sharing your experience,u did most of it wrong you would better practice before uploading any stuff like this,thank you i will surely change how i do my video,how are you liking the machine almost a year in,we use the coffeemaker every day for an extra shot of espresso in your cup it is great we seldom make full on latte cappuccino etc,you repeated this is so weird like 500 time,vianneycreates i did enjoyed watching the video lol but you did say this is so weird about 500 time lol,that is so weird lol,what all in one machine would you recommend,i just bought this and yes it is annoying there is no auto off when making an espresso,maybe i missed it but you realize the tamper wa the other end of the scoop and typically if one cup fill more it mean you have a tamping issuee puck may have cracked on the one side but i enjoyed the review,ty,thanks for your helpful video top coffee maker,i own a delonghi magnifica super automatic i can tell you with extreme certainty it is far far better than thing that said a couple of thing 1 save yourself a ton of time and preheat your milk to about 120f in the microwave before you actually turn the steam wand loose on it you will get your milk steamed frothed and up to 170f in far far le time 2 make sure the steam is activated and lit before you start steaming frothing without that it will self quit or just pump warm water 3 purge the water in the steam line before you actually use it to froth once the light say ready turn the steamer loose on an empty cup until only steam emerges then start frothing your milk,this or a ninja,i bought and tried this machine and immediately had a problem with too much overflow to the drip tray per expresso made 2oz expresso also produce 2oz overflow also the used grind puck wa wet a a swamp this also happens when just running water with no grind i changed the expresso grind to a finer type but same result i think my new machine is a dud thank you for your review,i have been having the same problem did you ever find a solution,thank you for your review this wa very helpful i am so glad you were so honest about every element of the process and the machine,glad it wa helpful i do have an extra little note in the description box to get the steam function to work better you have to push the steam button on the front of the machine too,i own this machine and have had no problem i have watched your video a couple time and it appears that you did not press the steam button to heat the milk it look like you left the brew button on instead i also wipe the frothing portion immediately and turn on the steamer to blow any remaking milk out no dripping mess,i meant to say that i do want to get this machine,yes good point tiffany i went back to the video and noticed that she forgot to press the steam button i had to go back because some other people mentioned it i do not want to get the machine though because it ha both feature for the expresso regular carafe really excited about getting it,i made a note of that in the description box thank you so much,thank you for showing u and reviewing it the crema can be a sign of fresh coffee and a good grind plus extraction,ty,absolutely ty,the same thing where you said you should let water drip from the machine you should do that with the wand of the frother fyi,i would cry with gratitude,i just wanted to say thank your for the review while it not a 1k machine spending 100 is a lot to me so i am happy to see you critiquing it and saying if you think it worth it when i watch a review i want to know everything that will annoy me since the plan is for it to be around for a while thanks again,yay that is what i do on my channel some like it some do not lol tysm,i have to agree with gabriela thanks for showing u how to use it but we could have done without all the complaining also this sell for dollar199 at target,ty todd,the water is evaporating more and not dripping enough coffee this can not be normal,make sure there is enough water in the reservoir i had that happen before and there wa not enough water to work correctly if that doe not help then i am not sure what the issue is i am sorry,take same time to go starbucks and buy one d,right lol,you were totally negative i have this machine and it definitely not that bad granted it not incredible but at least say something positive,nah,i wa about to buy this one well good thing i know not to buy this machine thank you for this video lol,vianneycreates any that you would recommend,good call,what espresso and coffee machine combo do you recommend,ummm starbucks and dunkin donut one with chocolate and caremal and sugar and ice,how do you like it do you still use it after knowing you have to babysit,vianneycreates i think you should stop considering this a a downfall to me it appears to be common sense considering the espresso and steamer share the same valve it wa be almost impossible for it do one of the same task while i can see on your mr coffee machine you keep referring to it more than obvious theyre 2 seperate aspect of the machine using different method entirely,vianneycreates thank you for your reply i am really interested in this machine but would you recommend a different one,i do use it every day mostly for regular coffee but we make espresso shot often too i probably would have bought a different machine if i knew that the espresso and steam can not work at the same time,agree the coffee maker broke and not sure if the streamer work this video is talking about too much personal rather than why i came,i am sorry i did not cater to you miss erin next time thanks for stopping by,thanks for the review realizing that this is not the machine for me,thank you for your explanation you are right i wish after making 2 oz espresso wa going to stop by itself,that would be nice especially at this price point oh well,i love those video with people reviewing cheap wannabe espresso maker do not read the user manual and think they are doing something awesome tip a real espresso maker doe not have a pump but a real boiler delongi ha some very good machine but you are getting what you paid for they are somewhat acceptable but they do not have the precision on temperature pressure and how the water is dispensed through the brewing group a real espresso machine will never cost below dollar1500 because there is a lot of technology engineering and accuracy involved they are almost like precision scale used to weight jewelry pulling a espresso and frothing the milk at the same time is impossible pressure split between the group and the frother making a espresso automatically is not impossible but almost a sacrilege unless you have one of those 5k dollar automatic machine any automatic espresso maker that cost below that you can be sure it is meh,yep,any reason on why the espresso will not start heating up,vianneycreates the water will not come through either like everything work like the light and the frothier but everything thing else doe not the steam doe not work it doe not make any type of noise no hot water come through no nothing basket is empty and the water container for the espresso is full,it take a while but you have to put the basket in empty turn the machine on press the espresso button to let some water come through when it begin coming through turn the espresso function off press the button again when the button turn green you are ready to put grind in the basket then run the espresso again it is weird i know but the light ha to be green and ready i hope that help,it is actually pretty common for your shot to be a little uneven when brewing believe it or not when coming out of one head haha and also when steaming and frothing you are milk you are usually supposed to start at the top alto froth then move towards the middle against the back and finally at the bottom closest to you for it to do what is called a whirlpool so it consistently stir and you get even steamed milk,thanks for the tip like i said i wa a barista in college and we began at the bottom of the frothing pitcher to really heat up the milk and then moved up for the froth i think it work however you do it lol,this wa painfull to apsorbe you should search on yt for great tutorial for making espresso and learn how to properly use machine and how to make perfect espresso and you will start to enjoy using this coffee machine,vianneycreates you did not label the video a an unboxing first impression you titled it a a review but did not even know how to work it,vianneycreates sorry if i upset you with my opinion and with my advice that wa not my intention,if you know how to use it why are you watching an unboxing and first impression video anyway thanks,wish you would have read the manual and learn how to operate everything prior to making the video because it doe make it look like the coffee machine itself ha issue but it really doe it,vianneycreates ok i did not mean to come across rude i am sorry it just seems like you were struggling at the beginning to get through everything i have read a lot of review and i am still debating lol i would like the breville stuff but it is a little too expensive for me ugh thank you for your review again i apologize if i came across the wrong way,it actually doe have issue john i still use it daily but hardly ever use the espresso side take way too long to prime in between making the espresso and the froth but thanks for telling me how to make my video,you did not press the froth button on the front of the machine that is why the steam ran out,thank you i added that info in the description box,do you have a issue with smell of rotten milk after using the milk vapor i have had it for several month and that tube absorbes milk retains it milk inside the smell is horrible thought a rat died inside the machine i also clean that tip on every use,oh wow that is gross i just do what i show after i froth the milk i put water in the frothing pitcher and froth it for a little while i have not had the issue you are talking about but we do not use the frother very often,a friend gave me a delonghi espresso cappuccino machine and i have never used it after watching some video on these machine i know i will never be using it what a production for a cup of coffee way too much trouble,strange because you have noticed a different foam to milk than i am and looking for the possibility of reworking and because it is present strange,we hardly ever use the espresso function but when we do i definitely let the espresso function warm up then make it and then press the steam button until it warms up and then use it it is not ideal but that is how this thing is set up,you talking to much get to the point,i hope you are doing well today too daniel,i tried but she is the worst,vianneycreates kool i have that machine and love it but the newer one is set different also you should have read the manual first but from the start it wa clear you did not like it at all no need to keep hearing you whine,a thank you,nice review thank you,ty,thank you for this video,no problem,i love the fact that you referenced rick and morty love the video just got me one,you talk really fast,thank you video is worth ten thousand word when you buy thing on line you can not tell what you are getting i just ordered this from best buy it seems like a high quality machine however after watching having second thought now about the temperature of the milk glad i did not get the mister coffee espresso maker,vianneycreates i am taking it back tomorrow the steam frother doe not work supposed to get the temp to 140 degree f but you are only supposed to use it for one minute at a time three time max three minute max the milk is still cold the frothier work but the milk is cold ha this worked for you have you added hot milk to your espresso drink,happy to help just make sure the frother is primed you have to press the button that ha the little steam picture when it is green it is a go i put that info in the description box because i can not go back and add the info now,foe the frothing i noticed that you have to reprime the pump after each time you make an espresso otherwise it run out of steam did you notice that also,i have noticed that now yes it ha some weird little procedure,thank you for the video very clear and helpful,happy to help ty,invader coffee ha some of the best coffee i have ever had i love how the original invader blend is air roasted preventing the bean from being too acidic or burnt but my favorite coffee that they offer is the mexican chocolate it is the smoothest best flavored coffee blend that i have ever had another good blend that i have tried is the whiskey blend which is my third favorite no bitterness yet deep flavor it is to die for finally i love how the company is run by a vertern and how the website is super user friendly and delivery is fast and on time i highly highly highly suggest you get yourself some invader coffee,thank you for this review now that you have had this for a few month what do you think sorry i have not seen what you think now in the comment for the warm milk and the cap setting on the steamer warm milk close the vent should have 2 5 small hole when open it push air into the milk to get the froth bubble i am looking at the breville barista express but i wanted to watch this video because de longhi make great product and i am having a hard time choosing thanks for the video,iudita trotter i had money to spare i got the breville infuser and the smart grinder pro i must say if i wa to do it all over again i would buy it again but i like hand on and doing the work myself and i must say it is a latte work i know cheese joke but i must say great for me hope that help i have a list of great machine i wa going to buy but at the end for what i wanted to learn and try it wa the best for me,betty tv i have bought the breville infuser it is amazing i must say i am completely in love with it now with that said i have made a lot of bad drink with it till i got the grind just right and shot timed out perfectly hint u a teaspoon or table spoon of creamer and then the rest with milk before you froth i am making latte better than the place i went to in the past grinder is the most important do your research i bought the smart grinder pro both great together,me too,i am curious a well,pretty unfortunate that you did not read the instruction manual before attempting to use the machine i actually prefer the manual stop for the espresso because i do not want my machine to tell me how much dilution there should be every time or how much crema i should get if people have an issue with watching their machine for 30 second then yes they should get an auto stop machine i am sure people have watched this video without reading our description and just think that the steamer doe not work which is sad,i feel like she went into this missing mr coffee more than wanting to actually give this a shot i would hate to design a complete and complex device only to have i opened the box i do not know how to use this this thing suck be the tone throughout the review,scott g bruh,what is even more sad is when someone think so highly of themselves that they have to throw shade on someone they have never met i assume you do not talk to your friend or family like a jerk fortunately i read my manual before watching this video no i am probably not a coffee aficionado like yourself maybe try crafting your word more like you do your coffee so they taste a little better going down,i bought this machine im not a critical a you are mine wa 150 i guess if i wanted a professional capuchino espresso super frothing machine i would probably spend 1000 of dollar on a starbucks machine it like trying to get ferrari performance from a datsun sorry i love my machine keep it simple,leoguerra i am thinking of purchasing this machine can you please share where you bought it at such a great price thank you,you do not have to take my review wo personally and tbh if i had paid dollar150 i would be happy through williams sonoma it wa closer to dollar300 i have bought the little mr coffee espresso machine the dollar30 one and they are better at what they do than this be well,thank you i really enjoyed watching your review,ty for your input have had major problem with just the coffee maker and espresso part with unit malfuctions not even tried the latte function for bco430 after major issue they asked me to show a photo of cutting the cord would send me another bco430bc instuctions basic lack trouble shooting expresso leak from the back everytime,someone else left a message about the water coming out of the back too i have not had that problem but at time the coffeemaker will not run i press the button it heat up when i come back it ha turned off and no coffee i press the button again and then it run the coffee and take very long to brew now i will try and contact williams sonoma for a new one not so easy now that the physical store are closed,thank you so much for the video super informative which model do you recommend that would be a 10 10 for everything this machine can do and more i wa not a fan of a few thing just like you said but i am having a difficulty time finding one that doe everything including froth while the expresso is being made and it would get on my nerve having to babysit that like you said,since we are all quarantined and my coffee shop have closed i decided on this unit it is my first all in one and i can not even get the coffee to brew lol i have had many coffee maker but all it doe is produce a lot of steam and the 8oz of water i pour into the reservoir just dribble out the back and i am left with no coffee doe not seem like i am doing anything wrong fill reservoir with water 8oz put coffee in filter press on off button any advice thank you,vianneycreates hola thanks i did only add a cup of water this morning since it wa just me i did try it again with 6 cup of water and still the same thing no coffee in the pot and water running out of the back of the machine i am so disappointed in this machine thanks for your advice i will be calling de longhi tomorrow morning and most likely returning it this week,hello i think i read your message wrong are you putting in 8 ounce or 8 cup of water if you are doing 8 ounce for one cup of coffee i do not doubt you are getting nothing lol a lot of time with drip machine about 1 4 to 1 2 cup of water stay in the ground so you need to add a little more water in than you are expecting to come out i hope that make sense also if you are only making one cup you should also press the button that say 1 4 cup that help in the way it brew smaller amount it is right next to the on off button i hope this help ty,do you still recommend this machine i wa thinking about getting one and i have not found anymore review,hello i like it but if you can swing a femur buck i would get a machine that let you froth at the same time that the espresso is being made otherwise it is a good machine but you have to wait between frothing and making the espresso,thank for the review i wa going to buy that but saw the review at target so i change my mind now that i saw your video glad i did not buy it it is a nice machine but heard it broke too much,yeah i have had it for a while now and am still on the fence lol if you can swing a few more dollar i would get a different model,doe it make hot water,vianneycreates yes it doe if you prime the espresso you hit the same button you would to pull the shot and turn the steamer on at the same time this will then produce piping hot water out of the steamer wand this is how i make americano is using the machine i really do wish you would read through the user manual not just the quick start guide before spreading a lot of misinformation about the machine you obviously have quite a large audience here so it is a real bummer to see so many people deciding to not buy this machine after seeing thing you say that are simply not true,i suppose if you run it through the coffee maker without ground otherwise no,thank u for the video i almost bought this machine and i am glad i didnt,yesterday i bought this razor coffee very tasty but need a skill for frothing milk i am curious how coffee from sachet would taste,i think it is the operator not the machine,thanks for ur good video i ve bought this machine too and i didnt know how to use it it wa really helpful,happy to help make sure to see the little note i left in the description box about pressing the foam button to prime it before using the side switch,when you are frothing the milk you have to make sure that the steam button on the front of the machine below the esspresso button is green which indicates that the steamer frother is primed that is why the milk frother did not actualiy heat the milk for her i love this machine and have had it for 2 year,i have been trying to figure out why my frother doe not work i press the button and wait for the light but every time i try to froth with my machine it only ha a couple second of steam before stopping,the instruction do say to press the steam button and wait until it is on,what setting do you need to turn on,vianneycreates well i usually press on the steam button then i wait for it to turn green then i start steaming amp frothing,vianneycreates it is a single boiler machine you can not do both at the same time it is not like a commercial machine lol i would suggest making your shot then prime the steam the hot milk and cappuccino setting on the panarello steam wand determine what setting you need a such the hot milk is just a it say it heat the milk the cappuccino setting froth it it is a newer design put on most of delong delonghis machine,sorry about that did not notice your note,vianneycreates do it please,hi vianneycreates i am thinking of purchasing this machine for a mother is day gift all the other machine that i have seen that make espresso and a coffee maker are above dollar1000 at william is sonoma did you decide to keep yours and if so have you got it to work like you wanted it to thank you i appreciate your feedback,vianneycreates hi we kept it and finally got it working right i wa grinding up the coffee bean in the vitamix it wa way to fine plugged up the machine have a great and wonderful weekend,no worry i think about making another video just focusing on the timing and how the function work independently of each other procedure however anytime i have ever made a follow up for a product no one watch it lol the initial video still get all the view,thanks,you forgot to push the steam button to get more steam,vianneycreates thanks for your help really appreciate that unit is having problem making an espresso seems like it doe not have enough power making one expresso can take up to 5 min or more coffee dribble out tried various coffee grind and still have the same problem what do you think should i return the unit,i did it is still not our favorite you can not prime warm up the espresso and the foam frother at the same time so we froth the milk first then press the button for the espresso wait for it to prime make the espresso then combine the two in a mug cup of course you can make the espresso first then froth the milk whatever you prefer,super we just got a similar unit we were having difficulty with getting the machine to work well with what you showed we were not getting the unit primed properly so there wa not enough hot water pressure did you keep the unit,yes i have since figured that out i made a note of it in the description box thank you,like the video way to many add though thanks,thank you,i have been considering this one idk if i want it now though thank you for your in depth review,vianneycreates i am do not think i am a fan of manually stopping the espresso machine i just love that it ha the coffee maker with it do you have an espresso machine that you do recommend,happy to help we have been using it since i posted the video it take some getting used to the frother and the espresso can not be primed at the same time so you have to choose to prime one use it then wait for the other option to prime about 5 minute then use it not my fave,i purchased this machine and have enjoyed using it the reason for watching wa to see the proper sequence for brewing and then steaming however you forgot to press the steam button the wand allows more air in when moved to the cappuccino selection creating more foam,vianneycreates short version yeah that is complete corporate baloney the mass industry consensus is that starbucks made that garbage up for one reason to justify putting the whip on the back of their min wage laborer to work faster and faster consider the source the absolute irony startbucks of all place is telling you how to make good espresso a good machine with good physic and temperature and above all good bean starbucks really at the right size grind and tamp is what make good espresso you should be able to sip straight espresso from a cup until it literally cold and it should still taste amazing,vianneycreates i know this is a couple month old now so maybe you figured it out but the reason the espresso and steam will not both show a ready is because they require different temperature the steamer requires it to be hotter so it is recommended that you actually do your espresso first and then steam otherwise your espresso can get burned you will notice that if you do espresso first then steam it doe not take nearly a long to prime mine is ready in le than 30 second this is because it can heat up faster than it can cool if you steam first it is actually waiting for the machine to cool down before showing that it is ready my guess would be that the coffee shop you worked at had a more advanced machine that had two separate heating element which allowed you to do both at once hope this help,also my son who worked at starbucks say to use the espresso within 10 second or it is trash lol i have been steaming the milk first then making the espresso even tough at the coffee shop i worked at we did both at the same time perfect,i have learned that since the quick start type guide did not mention it or at least i did not see it even though i read through it we have also noticed that the steam and the espresso will not get ready at the sam time is that your experience or are we not waiting long enough thank you,thank you for all the incite i just bought my first one for my partner and i we have no clue how to use it he is also a starbucks fan and like bustelo im trying lallava thanks again delonghi should hire you are very good at this,thanks so much it ha a bit of a learning curve but you will get the hang of it just make sure to press the steam button on the front of the machine and when it turn green you can then turn the little handle on the side to steam i kept losing frothing power because it wa not ready,thanks for sharing the demo i love my breville and little nespresso machine,happy to review it here i have been using it the past couple of day for coffee this morning my husband wanted a shot of espresso in his coffee worked just fine i do need to test the brother more bc that is the only thing that really gave me a problem the other day,,love me my instant coffee although i love tim hortons coffee too which is perked this seems like a whole lot of work to me having one of those machine sheesh lol hugz,vianneycreates oooo that doe sound good i am going to write that one down thanks again,haha i did not even think about that nescafe probably got her a a spokesperson because latino like their coffee not the other way around my mom always preferred it and she is from mexico i have never questioned it some people like dolca it ha a cinnamon flavor to it it is called cafe de olla that is some good stuff lol,vianneycreates thanks for the second recommendation is the latina thing because sofia vergara advertised their coffee machine or is it just because you find it in a lot of the supermercados i live in phoenix so we have a lot of product esp cleaning and drink from mexico in walmart plus there is food city which is geared to the latin market,i am with tonniece i buy nescafe instant coffee pretty much the only one i pick up it is a latina thing,tonniece a thank you i will give nescafe a try,good morning,hello,thanks for the review i always enjoy them i think this machine wa a little underwhelming i do not think i will be changing my pod machine in a hurry at this rate i have always been a little afraid of these kind of coffee maker too the steam get me every time,i hear ya a far a the steamer on this one it seems very weak and very safe i have had other machine were it is just the little metal pipe and you are on your own it will burn you easily but those work better,love your review a couple christmas ago i got a hamilton beach flex brew machine that brew one cup or a pot it work great this video wa great for learning what espresso and latte are and i am with you this machine doe not seem great enough per the cost,after 2 year whats the verdict i am trying to replace my keurig pod machine with some type of combination machine crafe pod and espresso thanks for info,that is great to hear i just had a basic hb 12 cup coffee maker and it just take way too long to brew my husband always ha to wait for it to finish up and it wa getting annoying i will give this little guy a chance for a bit i hope i get to liking it,hi v another great and helpful review but this machine is whack you have always been able to figure out any machine and give u tip and trick but it wa annoying to watch it act weird will you be keeping it give it a wk,it is a weird one i figured i would use it the next couple of day and over the weekend then i would have a better feel for it we will see
