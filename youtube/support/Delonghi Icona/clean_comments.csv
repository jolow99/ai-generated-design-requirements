0,my steam function stopped working after the second day is there something i am doing wrong someone help me out,i think this guy is very very strong man look at those about to be broken machine,lol marc aka very strong man,why doe my medium roast fine grounded coffee dows not have a strong espresso taste it taste like the one i make for drip coffee sorry im new anyone know please help,hi u most likely is your grind is not fine enough if using pre ground coffee be sure it is ground for espresso marc,wat a deelicious cappuccino mark,hey jade thanks for the comment marc,can you use the steamer without making espresso,hi melissa thanks for the question yes you can marc,i have this machine it is ok but not great not getting enough creama i have read somewhere that the mild wand should be replaced with rancilio silvia steam wand and the portafilter with a better one are these modification possible and what size is the portafilter,hi k thanks for the question this delonghi is what i consider and entry level appliance grade product while you could make modification understand it is a pressurized filter basket espresso maker that limit potential quality might be better to consider an entry level machine grade product with commercial size weight non pressurized portafilter and commercial wand like the gaggia classic pro marc,i am waiting for this machine to be delivered i am pretty sure i will not be using a pad,hi bk congrats on the new machine while some are okay with espresso quality from ese pod i would at least go with pre ground and whole bean ground fresh if at all possible marc,this machine suck trust me,hi ocq thanks for the comment sharing your opinion i think it is better to consider this an appliance and not a machine it is a case of you get what you pay for stepping up to a true entry level machine cost more,another pod machine want a real coffee machine,hi vicky here is a link to real prosumer level espresso machine marc,look good going try it now but with proper coffe bean,hope you enjoy marc,i have this machine and after practicing a while i get decent expresso with fresh coffee the beam produce decent latte and cappuccino a good machine for starter,hi jose thanks for sharing your experience marc,got it unused for around 1 year so do you know how to clean descale it for using it again please help,hi cn thanks for the question here is a link to the manual for the icona descaling instruction on page 12 hope that help marc,very help thanks a lot,you are welcome marc,hi thanks for the video ive just bought a delonghi icona vintage machine and i wanted to ask can you get more cream from the espresso i usually get little from coffe bean and im still learning how to make a good coffe too,whole latte love hi again i wanted to reply you through here to ask you something i recently saw that you have a huge amount of video i want to upgrade my machine and i wanted to know if you could give me some tip on which machine to choose to get a good espresso thanks in advance,whole latte love o,whole latte love i ve just searched icona vintage coffee cream and that wa what i asking thank you,whole latte love thanks for the tip,hi daniel the icona us a pressurized filter basket these do not produce at the same level a standard non pressurized filter basket crema from a pressurized basket is faked to some extent a liquid from the extraction is squeezed through a single tiny hole bubble pseudo crema form on the other side of the restriction do to release of pressure it is very different than crema formed in non pressurized filter basket which ha hundred of hole and it is the grind size of the coffee causing pressure to build during an extraction that said you may improve espresso and crema by using a different coffee or working with grind size if you are grinding whole bean fresh for brewing if lacking crema in your extraction and you have the option try grinding your coffee finers also use a coffee that is a known easy crema producer italian style bean blend which contain some robusta bean in the mix are good at that hope that help marc,best coffee,can i use 51mm tamper with this machine,thanks for replying i actually bought the modified basket which is non pressurized i got better extraction from those basket but built in tamper made it difficult to tamp with consistent force so which measurement is the best for this machine,hi thanks for the question delonghi list the pf size a 49mm the icona doe have a built in tamper i will also advise tamping is not critical on machine using a pressurized filter basket brewing system like the icona it is more for settling the ground in the filter basket tamping ha little if any affect on extraction with this type of machine marc,wakala,lazy bum how hard do you think it is to grind som effing bean i grind my bean in 30 sec and it smell gud,lol hi tb we grind all the bean check out this grinder,amazon ha them at dollar169 99 ebay ha them for around gbp145 my hitachi wa gbp45 and lasted 15 year my morphy richards is on ebay for gbp99 56 but i have only had it a couple of year so can not comment my daughter ha had this de longhi coffee machine for 3 year but it ha never been a favorite with her about 16 year ago i had a de longhi also different model and wa disappointed with it and took it back to the shop and exchanged it for a hitachi which served me well for 15 year and finally met it demise because the rubber seal broke and i could not get another now i have a morphy richards and i am happy with it so far time will tell my daughter is de longhi eco310 ha now given trouble it trip a main breaker when it is switched on something i am entirely able to fix probably if i could get into it however there are two narrow hole in the plastic bottom with security screw at the bottom of them these make it impossible to open unless you have a special tool and in my opinion are there to make you buy a new machine rather than have some able person mend it there wa a book called the waste maker about product that are made with planned obsolescence and this is a prime example of the art we are all in favour of recycling but recycling material take a lot of energy with a consequent impact on the environment fixing a device and continuing to use it for the next 10 year doe not consume any energy and save money in the purchase of a new one my recommendation is to buy a product from a different manufacturer my experience of de longhi ha been a poor one,mike collins no offense taken i appreciate your opinion my main point is appliance v machine in relation to build quality and serviceability cheer,whole latte love thanks for your response but i disagree with your reference to you get what you pay for i have not had my current coffee maker for long enough to know it reliability so far so good but what i can say is that it wa a good deal cheaper than the delonghi the hitachi i had before wa le than half the price of the delonghi and it made an average of 4 5 cup per day for 15 year and when it died it wa just because they were no longer supplying spare if i could have got the rubber seal it would have continued to serve when i did finally take it apart to see what part of it looked potentially useful i am like that i found it easily serviceable and it did not have any security screw in it last time i bought a toaster i went through quite a number taking them out of their box in the shop to find one that wa held together with regular screw then my daughter ever inventive put a cheese sandwich into it vertically in the belief it would make a toasted cheese sandwich naturally the cheese melted and ran out of the bottom but when i went to open it to clean it out i pulled the crumb tray out of the bottom and concealed underneath it lo and behold a deep hole with a security screw at the bottom of it i hate these manufacturer hence my comment on your video i hope it did not offend you but i hope the ceo of de longhi read it fat chance,hi mike thanks for sharing your experience the delonghi is best thought of a an appliance when considering build quality and serviceability big difference between an appliance and a machine it is the old you get what you pay for delognhi eco is a low cost appliance you can not expect it to have the reliability or serviceability of a machine my favorite entry level machine with the best bang for the buck is the north america version of the gaggia classic eu version wa modified a few year back and lost the 3 way solenoid valve the classic is very user serviceable with readily available and reasonably priced part take care of it and it will go for decade plus lot is of info for diyers like our gaggia classic support wiki,ursus trotter ut kaffee deluxe or this,i planning to get a tamper may i know what is the size 51mm or 52mm,for this machine,whole latte love thanks for replying,hi w tamper size is 52mm,hi i have been using this machine for a year but i am always having problem with it steamer when i set the steamer a it highest level the plastic part wa thrown out from the machine and it wa so dangerous seems like the nozzle doe not bear the power is it because i turned the steamer a it highest power immediately,i had this problem then i noticed when you clean the plastic part that blow off and are putting it back on again it push on and then you twist it slightly to the right and it lock into place hope this help,another thing do not stick the wand to the bottom of the cup build up pressure sound funny but seen it happen,i usually start at 50percent and slowly increase,hi yp a couple of reason why that can happen wand might not be in proper position on the steam tube or if clogged internally with milk deposit be sure wand is clean and properly positioned on steam pipe,i can use this coffee machine to make swan latte art,nice thanks for sharing,hello there i just bought this machine how to make a good froth of milk just wandering,sonnie teddy panarello wandnya di copot gan tapi agak tricky sih,whole latte love thanks a lot im learning how to make a good latte and try run my coffee shop,hi ab let the wand do the work for you check out this video for how to test and used the wand,i have this machine but it doe not seem to froth the milk any idea,danvanillabear you might have the wand submerged too deep i have the tip of the wand barely touch the surface of the milk and it froth quickly,thanks for the quick reply i have had the wand off and made sure air hole is clear fully clean creates steam but will not froth spit and bubble milk like mad but no froth,hi dvb is the machine making steam if making steam but not injecting air into the milk most likely cause is miss assembled or dirty wand these wand have air intake near the top blockage of air intake will cause poor performance,hi i have this machine and hear i need to cool it down after frothing milk before i pull a shot how to do this do i just release more steam from the wand i like to froth my milk before pulling my shot thanks,hi oc thanks for the question to cool a machine down refill the boiler after steaming open the steam wand and press the water dispensing button keep the button on until a stream of pure water and no steam come out of the wand,this machine is crap do not buy it,illy pod coffee a silly a it can be,what i would like to know is what make this machine worth dollar58 more than the delonghi ecp3630,i am looking at three deloghi machine the ecp3630 the eco310 and the ec155 i do not trust breville bad review for breville on amazon com however the review for the machine i am interested in are just a bad i like the ec680 the best but it over dollar300 in canada if you had dollar200u s to spend on an entry level machine what machine would you pick i will not be using the frother since i do not drink dairy,my pleasure if you have other question let me know,thanks that is the type of information i needed when comparing entry level espresso machine,hi allen thanks for the question both are entry level pressurized basket machine the eco310 is a newer design with more metal used in construction of exterior case the 310 also ha dual thermostat for better control of brew and steam temp,is this machine any good,no do not buy it plastic cheap crap doe not even make good coffee de longhi is ripping you ofd,yeah if you are willing to do some work i unscrewed all the plastic stuff off the handle and portafilter itself so it all metal and now a bottomless filter such a full bodied coffee with great crema before i did this i would always get watery thin shot,hi tm relative to other pressurized basket machine in this price range it is a decent machine a far better machine of this type is the gaggia carezza of course it cost more but a much better machine check it out here,you have just destroyed my interest towards that piece of hardware,talk metric even in the book it written metric amateur,hi evdv thanks for the comment we are in that backwards country that ha not fully embraced metric honestly we have made a real effort to always include metric measurement in more recent video,pphhh look like a flat white the guy is a joke,great review i just bought this machine and this video help a lot thanks,hi dl you are welcome thanks for the comment happy to help,hi guy im using the illy coffee pod a well however the espresso that come out is too watery n light how do you get it to be so nice n thick,hi guy thanks for the reply im using this coffee machine with exactly the same type of item provided and also used by you in this video i tried grinding the bean finner but still the same,whole latte love hi im using the deloghi eco310r,hi jpv what type of machine are you brewing with are you using a pressurized filter basket brewing with ese pod requires use of a pressurized basket if you are using a pressurized basket some other potential reason for watery light are under temperature brew water or perhaps a problem with the basket,hey are the ec 702 or pump espresso 3630 considered an entry level machine a the eco310 because i want to make a purchase and i am extremely confused between these three machine the eco310 around 600dollar in my country automatic espresso machine around 6500dollar thanks,hi yj yes all 3 machine you mention are considered entry level budget machine all use a pressurized portafilter which is smaller than standard commercial size,thanks for your video i have one at home but the pot filter is slightly different upon checking realized that mine is eco311 do u know the difference,michelles phan,michelles phan,hi we do not carry the eco311 so can not say for sure think it is essentially the same a this machine maybe just a version sold in other part of the world,can you advise which tamper size for this machine a the built in one is difficult to use,comical sanswich sir pun a ton lol,whole latte love you have said in a different comment to wingpang66 that the tamper size wa 52mm should we take this thread a the truth of the matter then,thanks again highly appreciate,chuong nguyen that is great thanks for letting everyone know,thanks got it already work just fine,that is not capuccino at all d where is dome or coffee ring dry late maybe but defenetly not capucino,it is not all metal exterior it is plastic 1 58,only the drip tray insert and handle are plastic,the coffee ha no crema after the pour why would you drink that,when using ground coffee the espresso from this machine ha mad crema,by not using pod i get crema everytime with the same machine,hi warren that is fairly typical for an entry level machine brewing with ese pod a definite trade off for low cost and convenience take a look at this video for the other end of the spectrum using a profitec pro 800 and a very fine high altitude coffee thru bottomless portafilter it ooze with crema,if you are using fresh ground coffee about how long would it take to properly extract a double shot what are the visual or other cue to know when is the right time to stop thanks,what is the right weight of grinded coffe for double espresso produced by this machine,f scarecro none i can really think of it is an entry level machine designed to work with the pressurized basket for making espresso from pre ground coffee or ese pod will definitely void the warranty if hacked to work like an non pressurized basket you will definitely need a grinder grind size is critical when using standard filter basket also understand this machine us an undersized portafilter it is much smaller than a standard 58mm commercial one with le mass so lower temperature stability could you hack it and make an okay shot once in awhile maybe but espresso is a game of controlling variable and this machine is not really up to controlling those variable beyond using it a equipped you would be better off with a machine like the gaggia classic it come with both pressurized and non pressurized basket ha standard size and weight portafilter an actual boiler a opposed to a thermoblock and large group head for thermal stability it is a little more money but it is a machine built for year of service not an appliance you can see it in action and learn more about why we think it is the best value in a solid entry level espresso machine,i have seen people cut off the black part of the filter to make in un pressurized whats the pro to doing that,np,thanks,the coffee it seems a little of cream,that d pends on your coffee i used fresh high quality coffee and get decent crema in my expressos,it is a decent machine a little different in that it is a super automatic so a lot easier to use and get good consistent result it is not a model we carry anymore this is the more current magnifica model,whole latte love how about delonghi esam4200s i have watched vedio it seems good,do you mean lacking crema the machine is an entry level unit and is brewing an ese pod in a pressurized filter basket generally can not expect high end crema rich shot,hi i am from indonesia i would like to ask for permission may i post your video to my website thank you,hi mel maybe please provide your website url so we can have a look,this is a latte not a cappuccino u need to froth ur milk steam it before pulling a shot ur shot last for only 10 it is gon na taste bad after more than 10 cappuccino le milk more foam half the cup should contain the foam and another half should contain shot milk to separate ur foam from milk u should use a spoon to first pour out the milk latte more milk le foam,espresso becomes oxidised after 10 which is why most espresso shot taste bad after 10 interesting i have not heard of an espresso that doe not oxidise and turn bad,blanche et bleu hi blanche what we would really prefer is to pull shot and steam milk at the same time on a machine like this with a single thermoblock boiler that is not possible so whether to brew or steam first is a personal preference we disagree with shot only lasting 10 second doe that mean i have to drink it in 10 second or it is no good perhaps you are referring to the crema breaking down there is some excellent research which show shot do not change much inn regard to flavor aroma in the first minute or two after extraction here is a link to the research which used trained tester and aroma sniffing mass spectrometer a for the milk machine with auto frothing wand like this one tend to produce an airier milk it is honestly a challenge to steam milk for a latte with an auto frothing wand a it is tough to produce a fine microfoam a we define in the video a capp is 1 3 espresso 1 3 steamed milk 1 3 frothed milk the milk poured at the end is very airy and what we would consider appropriate for a cappuccino while we do not have a big problem with using a spoon to hold back airier milk you will find a lot of professional baristas who have a huge problem with spoon,i bought this machine crap notice in every video when they express coffee there is no steam that coffee would have been crap not hot enougth,i wont thumb this video down you got on camera had a go well spoken good voice for sale i will say should be on tv but what wa the convience in this video i see lazyness but not convenience were you in a rush to go somewhere after this video convenience would be to have the basket pre packed which will show a nice creme and improve the reason for you making posting the video in the 1st place positive criticism,billab0ng83 always open to critique the point wa to show how someone who like the convenience of ese pod could quickly and easily make a cappuccino without having to also own a grinder no doubt higher quality espresso is made using coffee ground fresh just before pulling shot ease and speed wa the purpose here,milk from plastic bottle how to kill coffee,maybe the baccarat harcourt crystal bottle where not available at the time,we are coffee farmer and here some our activity harvest season in gayo sumatera please visit,not much of a head on the coffe is there,costa liamis pod offer convenience but you do give up some quality compared to espresso pulled with fresh ground on more expensive machine,when i attach the filter holder to the machine and turn it from left to right right it doe not seem to lock fully into the centre a shown here in the video it seems to stop slightly diagonally am i doing something wrong,you are welcome let u know how thing go a for lighter color make sure everything is warmed up run a blank shot or two and work with grind and dose to fine tune,whole latte love hi deeply appreciate the quick reply yes the machine is barely 3 day old im able to make a decent espresso but i also notice that when the coffee come out of the nozzle it seems a little lighter than the rich dark brown coffee that i am used to will give it a few more shot and see thanks again,zubin balaporia hi zubin if machine is new it may take some use to break in the group gasket which form the seal to the portafilter another possibility is too much coffee in portafilter such that it is compressing against the shower screen in the group head are you able to pull shot,i am trying to make latte art with this machine and i am still learning about shot and frothing properly i am wondering though is latte art actually possible with the quality that this machine produce,connie freitas while not impossible it will be a challenge this machine doe not have the steaming power of more expensive machine one key is to get the air in the milk early and then get the wand is air intake cover to stop air injection and continue rolling the milk to break up the bubble,i am planing to get delonghi dedica can i have more crema than delonghi eco 310 or 311 which one do you suggest dedica doe not support big cup two cup at the same time that is the only handicap i suppose,oytun oral main difference is size not all machine that do 15bar are the same in fact 15 bar is just marketing talk espresso generally brewed at 9 bar 15 bar is just what pump are capable of quality of bean is most important factor then grind then machine,whole latte love thanks for your explanation i will get a manual grinder old style i live in turkey and we are not enthusiastic about espresso too much gaggia is not sold unfortunately in turkey unless i am abroad i can not have it anyhow there is almost 60 dollar difference between eco 311 and dedica doe this difference really worth to buy dedica can i get acceptable flavour with enough cream thickness with eco 311 or should i certainly get dedica a i know both machine have 15 bar pressure what is the main difference other than the size additionally can we say the quality of coffee is more important than the machine under 200dollar or can we say that all espresso machine which have 15 bar pressure make the same quality of espresso,oytun oral dedica can do two cup just not 2 big cup it seems however your real concern is more crema all machine you mention should produce similar amount of crema if using the same coffee i put crema in quote a these machine all use a pressurized filter basket depending on who you ask the crema produced with pressurized basket is a little different than crema produced in a non pressurized basket where it is the grind tamp of the coffee which creates the brewing pressure for some that difference is not a big deal for other those at the espresso geek level it is a total deal breaker if honest crema is what you are after i suggest a machine with a standard size weight portafilter and regular non pressurized filter basket these require grinding before use so a grinder many lower cost gaggia machine come with standard size pfs and both pressurized and non pressurized filter basket with those you can start without a grinder and move up to non pressurized brewing if when you pruchase a grinder here are two gaggia machine you might consider gaggia classic gaggia evolution,this is latte not cappuccino,foam make it cappuccino i suppose i ve never seen a foamy latte,how may second last the erogation of the coffe with my icona it last 15 second and not 22 25,i have been using pre ground coffe vergnano thanks for your suggestion i tried to tamp firmer but the coffe now ha an acid flavor,what type of coffee are you using pod pre ground fresh ground with pod there is not a lot you can do to change the extraction time with pre ground you may be able to tamp firmer to slow down the flow if grinding your own you can grind finer to slow thing down with all that said this machine us a pressurized portafilter and not the puck of coffee to create the pressure so in the end it is the portafilter that control the flow rate,i am between this machine and kmix e 021 wich one is better and is it possible to do latte art with this machine,the 2 machine are very similar in capability but the kmix is a more recent design we find the kmix easier to use with the flip up lid on top while it is possible to do latte art with this machine it is not going to be easy auto frothing wand like those on the machine you are considering do not give a user the degree of control required to finesse milk texture,yuk pod coffee you need fresh coffee bean for good coffee,that espresso look vile in fact the whole drink look vile,it is a pod what did you expect lol,coffee is typically dark brown,doe the steamer micro froth for latte art,latte art is not easy,i love it,how much doe it cost im living in indonesia and it difficult to find this kind of machine here,harganya sekitar 300 sgd bung kalau di indonesia yang sekelas ini setau saya krups ada di best denki harga kurang lebih sama tapi porta filter sudah pakai kunci it cost about 300 sgd bro a far a i know krups is one par with the delonghi and you can find it here in best denki indonesia price is similar with delonghi but it came with lock porta filter
1,is it possible to program it to work at the time of pouring water in a certain way,is it possible to regulate the amount of coffee that come out of the machine or do you have to stand by the machine

they always produce good quality espresso and are very easy to work with the steamer work better than any other machine i have used for the same price range ours ha held up for year with 20 us each day even when the machine ha broken down by user error it been very easy to fix highly recommend,i bought this machine 3 month ago and love it it only get used 2 or 3 time a week however the last time

2,yeah or just buy a good espresso machine instead d,i like almost everything about this brewer my previous one wa a keurig 2 0 mybest kitchen and had a lot of issue this one is more basic but all the important feature are there if i had to name something i found a a negative it would be the size of the water tank i wa used to a larger one and have to fill this one daily a we drink 4 large cup every morning but it is a small thing in the grand scheme of thing,thx for the review just received it today wa suprised that it is a bit hard to rotate the lever the thingy thing you put the coffee on lol but in the instruction manual it say so,thank you,it is a good looking coffee machine but the basket are very badly designed the hole are so tiny that after a while they clogged up and impossible to clean them the coffee machine just shake when it try to push the coffee through it and it is worrying that it is going to break at this point it is completely useless and can not use it contacted delonghi but they could not be le interested i even tried to burn the basket over flame but did not help for this reason i do not recommend to buy this machine,update the solution to that is to make the hole bigger in the bottom of the basket it is possible to do that with a very small drill i tried it and it work now,appreciate your time effort and the basic you followed explaining about the coffee machine i have the same one and i needed a tutorial like this one thank you,thank you very much,maybe i am stupid but still do not understand once green button stoped after when light again instead drop coffe drop more water is it normal,peter l ideea it is that drop for 5 second black coffe 5 second brown because contain more watter and after the green light stop and when turn on is dropping more and more water instead coffe in the filter i saw remains a lot of coffe but to be honest even so i feel is strong coffe if i let just 10 second instead 15 to drop the coffe so i am guessing it ok i never used this kind of machine and because of that,yes there is still some water in the mechanism and in the grounded coffe compartment when the pomp stop giving you those drop,thank you so much for the detailed explanation it is so helpful,mamma mia superb,what doe this bg stand for could not figure it out doe anybody know,it is the colour,thanks for the thorough review great work,must be one of the best review i have ever watched thanks,great review thanks,i am using this machine for 6 year only cleaned 3 time in those year and it still make coffee like the first day a long a you use lime free water and with a little luck it will last much longer definitely recommend i am using with 51mm tamper use a real milk pitcher for milk frothing and do not froth the milk like in the video if you are not going to bathe in it no offense p just hold the pitcher at an incline so that the steam swirl the milk dig frother deep do not hold it too close to the surface slowly move it up and down voil you have frothy and creamy milk now the only thing missing are a koi fish tattoo mohawk hair and a pair of apple airpods thanks for the video,didem coskun same thing happens to me but i would not call it a problem because the foam is divided into two cup of course the type of coffee and it cream ratio are also important try with number 3 pod the deepest one,hi have you ever been a problem when you re brewing two cup at same time whenever i brew two cup at same time i always prefer americano americanos becomes foamless and le tasty do i sth wrong,i duno man i use it for like 1 year and clean it every 2 month but steamer stop working and i use only bought water,did anyone have the problem of splashing water from the side of the steam wand i bought this machine a few year ago and lately i wanted to steam milk for latte but water keep splashing out and the component easily fall out i wonder if it is only my machine is problem,you have to open the steam valve first before steaming milk into another empty container just for 1 second then water will come out then steam the milk clean off milk and then open steam valve again to clean out any remaining milk in the valve,lot of people have been seeing this problem i would not worry if it is not that inconvenient for you most plastic steam wand experience this from a machine,not that horrible steam omg,thank you for making this,delonghi is machine is very good i use magnifica s and it taste too good and i drink too much coffee the video wa very helpful with love from japan,thank you for the video how long do you suggest to heat up the milk like 20 second,you should keep the steamer hose deep in the milk and do not move the pitcher up and down like that it make large bubble and sprinkle milk all over instead,thanks four your video i ordered my machine today and paid 119 euro in lidl online germany just in case somebody is looking to buy it here is the cheaper i have found it,mi esce l acqua dal beccuccio del cappuccino come mai,the most horrible cappuccino,for this model do not have the cappuccino maker nozzle,yes it is there on the right side,owned this for year advice would be save yourself the effort of using the attached coffee tamper and buy a handheld one,halfnhalf ahh ok thanks a lot,brenda carmella personally i bought this a an entry point and if you had the budget would go for something stainless steel bit more rigid or even maybe the delonghi dedica which is roughly the same price range,hey im thinking of getting one of these is it worth the money or would you recommend me other brand,xmandie7x i would say the 51mm wa off a measurement that i would not say is very accurate a there is a slight gap i think a 52mm would be better suited if you can find one at the time i could not,xmandie7x i went for a 51mm one de longhi sell their own wooden handle one but i went for a full stainless steel one,can i ask you if it is hot enough or cold because i am not seeing any steam from expresso i hat it when it is a bit cold thanks,it get really hot depending on how much you let it boild the water i might have rushed myself a little or the camera did not catch the steam but the water for the coffe steam for the capucinno get dangerouselly hot,thank you for the review it really helped me,morgan augustine glad i could help,timothy leland it worked and i
