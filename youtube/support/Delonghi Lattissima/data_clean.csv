0,"Nespresso Lattissima Touch Coffee Machine Review | Marks out of 10, taste test, drinks made and more",is this machine suitable for single cup with lowest amount of milk i have this machine for 6 month now and it absolutely fantastic with no issue good to make a single glass of latte small and compact machine thanks for sharing noticed you left a similar comment on our latissima one review is it that machine you have or this one or both thanks for the informative review i like really hot milk coffee drink which nespresso machine do you recommend for me hi there i also like my milk to be hot and have been happy with the nespresso creatista machine i have owned a you can adjust the milk temperature on them and the hottest setting ha been fine for me especially the crestista plus and creatista pro hope this help is it hot enough i realy like my drink to be very hot i bought one from soul and soul and the temp is a joke a2b production thank you so much definitely will check that out for a milk based coffee the creatista machine are much better for temperature i struggle to hold the recipe glass when it is on the hotter setting i am not sure the temperature of the actual espresso will be much different though on that note the creatista plus i owned brewed a hotter espresso than the creatista pro doe hope this help and we have review of the creatista machine and a playlist of them on the channel in case you fancy watching those a2b production whats the other option pls yeah it is not very hot is it drinkable but if you like it really hot then there are better option available after descaling when i put the milk frother on it drain all the milk help any one know what is wrong hey thanks for this video i am still really confused i enjoy having a cup of latte everyday i really do not get the perfect machine for my own use what is your advice a2b production thanks a lot hi there thanks and glad you liked it personally i like the creatista a a nespresso machine for latte a you can control the milk froth and heat a lot more we have some review on the channel if you want to explore those more and also a creatista playlist the milk container to functioning what is the problem please can you use any coffee pod to make say a latte a they got measurement on also what are the number for hi there we do have video on the channel that explain the cup size and also how to find the best nespresso pod for you in case they help personally for a latte i like to use two pod of 40ml espresso with milk but the nespresso site say you can also make it with 1 lungo pod 110ml with a similar amount of milk just got gifted this machine first use too much milk froth not much coffee milk straight from refrigerator therefore coffee is lukewarm will require trial and error to achieve the perfect cup of coffee i am australian we like our coffee hot with a little bit of froth not most of the bloody mug my old machine wa a lattisima en560b which served me well for 10 year of daily use many of the design flaw in that model have been solved with this model the milk container is much easier to clean and different sized and different shaped mug and cup can be easily accommodated the off white colour would not have been my choice white in a kitchen is not great i would have chosen the black colour but this wa a gift so it is what it is yeah heat is the most common issue i hear from subscriber with the lattissimas mainly the milk froth heat i like you also find the froth too airy we have a creatista machine now and solves both those issue thanks for sharing your thought great video wish i looked at it before i bought the machine for me the coffee is way too low in temperature i like a hot coffee and this is not hot at all i virtually drink strait away other wise it cold sorry to hear that sure your comment will be helpful to others though so thanks for leaving it the video mention that there are no ristretto option in this machine the coffee machine is actually programmable and you can pre program it to use different quantity of water and milk that is because we all like our coffee differently coffee volume is set at 40 ml espresso by standard but can be programmed to a little a 25 ml ristretto up to 200 ml the range for milk is 30 ml 200 ml also the milk froth can depend on the kind of milk used temperature and even the position of the nozzle refrigerated skimmed or semi skimmed milk is recommended in user guide all in all i think it is a great little machine for someone who doe not have super high standard for coffee but like a bit of special treat cheer for mentioning that it can be programmed for ristretto but wa just meaning it did not have a dedicated button for it a that can be a bit of a bind for people who want to switch easily between ristretto and espresso think the gran lattissima ha both of those button off the top of my head so that could be an option for those who want both and we have a review of that machine on the channel for those who might be interested in it a friend made me a cup of coffee using this machine just this week and i loved it perhaps i am not the coffee connoisseur that some are but i really enjoyed this cup of coffee question though doe this machine steam the milk or merely froth it based on the temperature displayed it merely froth it right i currently have a nespresso machine and separate frother which work great how different is the touch model to the regular machine that cup of coffee did taste different better but maybe i am just imagining this hey gloria i am assuming your question is if the machine us hot milk or cold it doe heat the milk for you when frothing although warm milk is accurate a i would not call it hot d jeremy hipkiss great video i recently bought this machine and wanted to find guide or review that show how to use and your vid answered all that i wanted to know really nice to hear thanks for that really awesome review the demo you guy did wa super informative to help me decide to get one of these or not and even if i do not buy one i am glad i found your chanel you did a great job thanks thanks jim glad you found u too and that it wa helpful like this review i bought mine about 6 year ago had not used it for a while so this review saved to trouble of reading the manual love this maker so easy to use ha a good variety of cup size the coffee are delicious the only con is that the coffee is not piping hot perfect for me because i prefer my coffee cooler than most glad it wa helpful and thanks for sharing your thought on the machine hi from australia we are on our 3rd latissima and love them i cleaned it after every use we have purchased this model so looking forward to continuing our association with nespresso thanks for sharing and great to hear amazing review totally agree the coffee still not the best but easy to make yeah it is definitely a pro and con decision is not it thanks for sharing definitely the water is not hot enough i have to use a pre heated cup and at time put the coffee inside the microwave for 20 second i like hot coffee can you use oat barista milk for example instead of regular milk super helpful thanks glad to hear it i have bought it this morning and when i saw this video i became so upset that i went back to them and ask for a refund why it is because i told the seller that i want it for my office and that i am very busy to order a latte from a coffeeshop so how i am a supposed to do all the cleaning a it is mentioned on the notice i do nt have a dishwasher in my office and do not have time to wait for the 30 minute before the cleaning they accepted to take back the lattissima touch and gave a nespresso citiz and milk with a lot of nespresso capsule glad you ended up with a machine you are happy with thanks for the review do you like coffee nice i discovered a neat trick some people prefer to heat up their cup especially for small one like a ristretto or espresso if you use the milk frother cleaner before making your drink you could use the hot cleaning water to heat up your mug not gon na lie my favourite part of the review wa your accent d great review thanks haha cheer glad it helped thanks for your review it wa the one that made me to get one of my own the essenza mini we already have is now moving to my parent is yacht hi can it make cold coffe hey a2b what wa the size of the latte cup that you used really enjoying the video recently found the channel and learning a lot can you make just a normal coffee with this hi there it make an espresso and a lungo you can also add hot water to the espresso and vice versa to make a long black or americano style drink i personally need about three shot of espresso when mixing with water though to get the flavour i am looking for hope this help a bit hello i am watching you from middle east i buy gran lattissima last week but there is problem on the machine i told them i want lattissima touch they will bring her to me tomorrow i hope i like and no problem on lattissima touch i love see your review and information from you thank you thanks for that and great to hear you got the machine you wanted hope you do not have any issue with it how to fix the burnt coffee smell taste which one make the best coffee of this and the nespresso gran lattissima tough question my gut say this one but i will try and film a side by side video soon excellent i wa thinking to purchase this one and this presentation help me i really need you to help me please i just bought one like this machine and i used it once to do latte and did not clean it so i tried to do another cup and it did not work and the bottens are all lit and the milk would not worm up any more i wish u would answer thanks i am afraid this is probably one where it is best to ring nespresso for their advice i would try dismantling the frother and hand washing it in warm soapy water to see if that help though look like coffe what about temperature really good and informative review thanks guy great job i am big fan of this model easy to make lovely coffee in the morning recently i noticed when relase the item capsule go into container approx 10 15 ml of water go into container too tried to clean it but nothing helped any advice please thanks i will hi there probably best to speak to nespresso on that one i am afraid in case there is a fault with the machine if you find an answer then please do share it with u a it may help others with the same issue doe it keep the milk cool a2b production thank you if you mean the milk in the carafe while you are not using it then no you need to put the frother in the refrigerator can you make tea using a capsule with hot non frothed milk using this a2b production thank you hi not really a the machine always froth the milk to some extent doe the fill milk container heat up or just the portion that you use just wondering if excess is still cold and can be returned to the fridge thank you yes the container of milk remains cold and can be popped back into the fridge great review in the froth section if you turn it to the least froth doe it look like a version of hot milk like for hot cocoa aor is it still quite worthy trying to choose from this and the plus thanks glad it helped i would say it is still quite frothy really from what i can remember will u recomend nespresso lattissima one for new beginner like me i love espresso doe it make good one i would say the lattissima one ha been designed for espresso or lungo drinker who just want the option to have an occasional milk based coffee without having to have a separate milk frother on the worktop a for the espresso itself there is plenty of choice in the espresso range on the originalline machine and personally i prefer them to the vertuoline so it will all come down to whether you like the taste of nespresso coffee or not can you but chocolate pod in this too you just pop them in like normal pod and pour an espresso or lungo shot of water through here is a link to the review we did of some in case that help a2b production how do they work obviously there no hot chocolate button yes there are compatible hot chocolate pod available for this machine we have reviewed some on the channel actually but nespresso do not make them i just bought this machine last weekend and i never tasted such a good coffee if you like a proper italian coffee with a thick foam of milk this machine really doe the job it is very easy to clean and if you put the used capsule out in the litter downstairs the machine stop dripping everything on this machine is great you can easy clean the milk reservoir also put it in the fridge you can instal your size of cup differently so these are no criterion you can choose for so many different tast of coffee so what you want bitter or sweet i think it is terrible most people put so much water with coffee this look and tasted like brown tea to me and ha nothing to do with coffee my only critical point is that for a real cappuccino you need first to put a ristretto and after you put than some foam on the top normally with a spoon so the milk doe not mix with the coffee but this machine doe first the milk than the coffee wel most people will not mind but this is not an cappuccino it doe tast anyhow very nice and also go with illy segrafredo and lavazza capsule which to me are the best coffeebrands in the world thanks for sharing your experience with the machine and glad you have found the right machine for you hey there found this video most helpful a i have this machine and needed some tip on how to use it efficiently i am not completely impressed but it doe the job so i think 6 10 is most fair in your rating glad you agree with the rating and that it helped too i am not sure whether i am doing something wrong but i am following your video and went i press the latte button the right middle it doe the coffee but doe not seem to put much milk in it put le in than a cappuccino do you know if i am doing something wrong hi there could be that the cup size need resetting but also worth checking if the froth dial is turned to the left hand side so it is on the lowest froth level we actually had more milk come out when it wa on that setting if i remember right doe this machine make a cold froth or only hot im aware that the aeroccino make cold foam but can not find anywhere is the latissma one doe hi there only hot a far a i am aware thanks for the review can you tell me how many milliliter is the cup you used in the video for making a latte hi there they are the 350ml recipe glass like the machine doe look good but only disappointing is coffee is not very hot other than it is ok yeah the coffee could definitely be hotter could not it ok so i bought this it arrived yesterday i am struggling i pressed the latte button and it made me a really tiny drink yours made a lovely long latte had you programmed it to the size of your glass i think the factory setting are set at it being tiny hi there no i actually did not reset any cup size on this one but yes some of the drink size do seem a little crazy at default level do not they hope you managed to sort the problem out thank you for the video got mine month ago and just used it the manual that came with it wa long and complicated and so at first i regretted my purchase but with your video it simplified it so much so a very big thankyou for posting thanks for that great to hear and really glad it helped thanks so much for your review i am buying my first ever coffee machine this week so it is really helpful so torn between this one and the citiz and milk i feel like this one would be better a a first because it look so easy to make but i know you prefer the coffee from the other when you have only ever used a kettle and you want easy to clean and easy to use would you say this one thanks so much hi there thanks for that the aeroccinos are really easy to use to be honest so i would not worry too much about that the aeroccino 4 is also dishwasher safe like the frothers on the lattissimas so i guess it just depends which one you prefer after watching them in use please can you always give an indication of the volume dispensed so that we can select the right size of glass for each coffee type also an indiction of he maximum height of glass would be useful the recipe glass i used is 13cm tall so not sure if you can judge that from the video i will be unboxing all my lattissimas again soon to compare them all side by side so will include that measurement on the video when we do mine are 15cm tall costa size so still not sure if the would fit this machine a2b production that you i will look them up hi there sorry we did not include that the cup glass used on the video are from the nespresso view collection in case that help cappuccino cup 180ml and the standard sized recipe glass 350ml i love all your content mate it is been a great help to me trying to pick out a machine i appreciate all the honest review and that you take the time to show u everything i wa tossing up between the essenza mini aerocinno 3 the lavazza desea and finally this one after i realise it kinda combine both those smaller machine into one i think i might just end up sticking with this one for simplicity sake going to out to buy it in the next few day so lmk if you think otherwise based on your experience keep up the awesome content cheer mate glad the video have helped i have only reviewed the nespresso machine to date but looking to review a few other brand going forward my honest opinion is that i would rather go for an aeroccino and seperate nespresso machine than a lattissima myself a just think the cappuccino latte taste better a the froth from the aeroccino is more pleasant to drink a make a nicer froth hope this help but if you have other question do let u know hi i just got this a an xmas pressie is this an older nespresso machine they do not even sell it on there website anymore i am thinking of exchanging to a more modern one the lattissima one or the gran lattissima yeah it ha been out for quite a while it is still a popular machine sure it wa on the website last month but may be out of stock now but is certainly different in design to the other two you mentioned hope you get one you are happy with thank you i wa actually looking for a good machine and for me one of the important thing in the coffee and i think it is for everybody is the taste but then the tastecoffee decrease the flavor due to an incremental of water coming in the milk that would be not good for me yeah we agree with that taste is the number 1 factor for u too frikken ingenious hi what do you think u best to get a gran lattissima or touch my partner and i drink 4 cup each a day a2b production yes the latissima doe seem airy thanks for the advice hi yeah i just prefer the froth of the aeroccino v lattissima a find the lattissimas too airy i had a citiz with attached frother citiz and milk for around 5 year and served me well think it is worth buying new if you can just to have the warranty and to know that nothing is faulty but understand they are not cheap a2b production hi sorry to mess about with question but after i posted that last night i wa thinking about the cost of a separate aeroccino and then you said you preferred the coffee in a citiz they sell them on ebay with aeroccinos so maybe opt for one of them together instead of buying separate it is a tough one due to the price difference you could probably survive with the touch but you will have to fill the milk and water up more regularly and also empty the used capsule holder more often my gut say gran lattissima but it is close because of the cost hey i just got my machine literally an hour ago and i have a stupid question lol can you use any pod to make any of the drink like can a pod make a latte but then a basic coffee lol help hahaha hi so you can get re usable nespresso pod so that you can use any time of coffee bean you like also nestle owns nespresso and nestle is a terrible company that exploit slave labor and unsafe work environment for their slave so i recommend not buying from nestle nespresso if you can avoid it do not apologise i wa reading through these comment to see if anyone had asked so your comment helped me i am away to see the other video now cheer hi there in case it help we do have more video on the channel on how to choose the right nespresso pod but personally would stick with an espresso 40ml pod for a latte with this machine even though i think nespresso recommend a lungo pod on some of the latte recipe on their website when using an aeroccino just about finding a pod intensity or flavour that work for you in fact would stick with an espresso shot for all of the drink on this machine unless you specifically want a lungo hope this help a bit but there are lot more video on the channel to stop the drip just release the pod if you leave the pod in the chamber it is going to drip that would definitely work if you can get into the habit of doing it also you could pull out the drip tray when finished prepping your coffee yeah sadly it still dripped after releasing the pod a little more watery with no pod but still not great with this colour of machine i will be honest that thing look like it belongs in a hospital a some sort of medical device from the 1980 is that being said it look like it it work well maybe because the color i have the silver one and it is very beautiful  haha yeah i exactly what you mean it is funny because when we opened it my wife and son had a real debate over whether it wa modern looking or not hi mate a you know i brought one after ur first vids after a month or so with it my only trouble are 1 the first cup is always like warm and not hot and 2 when setting the the cup size i do not know how much coffee and how much milk to use surely that defeat the object of having different option are not the different option just a different ratio of coffee and milk hi mate yeah it would be a lot easier if they set the cup size correct from the start would not it like you say the different cup size are ratio of milk to coffee but also supposed to be different froth level too think nespresso recommend using the lowest froth level for cappuccino and highest for latte macchiato i would also be using the lowest level for a latte but would like an even lower froth level for the latte myself for a cappuccino 1 shot 40ml according to nespresso 100 ml of milk seems to work when using an aeroccino and barista recipe maker and the nespresso cappuccino cup are 180ml if that help to gauge thing a bit the latte latte macchiato recipe glass are 350 ml suppose trial and error and finding what taste best to you is the best way to go about it but completely agree they should set it right to start with and more info given a to what froth level to use for each drink can not remember if it say it in the manual though totally agree with what you say about the heat too cheer for dropping back on to give your experience i am thinking of buying this one or the citiz amp milk which one you think is better i personally would go for the citiz and milk a prefer the froth consistency and think they are more reliable long term good video i have the red version of this which i have not seen anywhere else it may be a limited edition the milk frother is temperamental mine ha completely failed now getting a new one tomorrow yeah that seems to be the common complaint with lattissimas sadly doe not it a broken frother that or have heard they can tend to get stuck in descaling mode will try and google your red machine a sound interesting how would you rate this compared to the atelier i got mine back from repair a few day ago and after getting used to the quality of the barista maker the atelier cappuccino tasted disgusting not sure if there is still a fault with the machine or whatnot but i ask this a i am wondering if it is better quality just for a basic and quick cappuccino a2b production i will definitely check it out thank you hi jack sorry to hear that mate so i would say this is better than the atelier on taste but still not the best we have actually just published a review of the lattissima one and that wa better taste wise but we would still go for an aeroccino barista maker or creatista over any of the lattissimas we have tried up to now should have a review of the lattissima pro coming soon hope this help a great review but overall i do not think this is an improvement over the lattissima that i currently own in storage and replaced with delonghi cappuccino bean to cup machine the main problem is the temperature of the milk based drink and which are usually le than 60c once dispensed and not hot enough it seems this revision continues this and still ha the same issue with luke warm milk drink the temperature issue is something that nespresso are asking delonghi to program and condition into the lattissima range a their bean to cup version that i have dispenses a milk based drink at least 8c 10c hotter and at a more acceptable temperature but are both very similar especially in the way they dispense milk the temperature thing wa my main reason from moving from nespresso pod machine to a bean to cup and although the new range of nespresso machine do look great they still seem to have the same old too cool temperature dispense issue awesome review and very informative please keep up the great video joff cheer for the info joff yeah the temperature of the milk is definitely an issue with this machine and will be interesting to see if any of the other lattissimas fair better do not know if you have tried either the creatista plus or creatista pro but the milk temperature on both of those nepsresso machine is excellent and you can control it too great review but where did the intro music go if i may say i find it a bit odd that the intro is now the sound and picture of whole bean being ground considering that you seem to be 100percent nespresso review now if you two are branching out that would be splendid cheer kurt yeah just fancied something a little shorter and more coffee related for the intro that is all hope you get used to it certainly interested in all thing coffee so did not want it too nespresso specific in case we review other coffee machine down the line nice new title sequence cheer duaine little homemade sound effect of a steam wand love the new intro thanks glad you like it now for a matching outro brilliant review yes it wa me that sent the request for the mark out of 10 to be included in the video thanks for doing it a it sum it all up nicely look like this will the start of something new i use this machine at least twice a day and a i have said previously doe everything you can ask for it with all but a few minor short coming my regard to both you and your wife glad you enjoyed the video and are enjoying your machine too hope it serf you well that is the newer version of the one i had many year ago and it look like they have not improved on the temperature of the drink it wa the low temperature that made me return it i found the milk wa lukewarm at best i may be the odd one out here but i always use fahrenheit when measuring drink temperature so an on screen graphic when you do temperature test may be be a good addition would probably help your u viewer too thanks again for all your great review yeah the milk drink are definitely not the hottest no where near the temp of a creatista i did not about measuring in fahrenheit you know sorry about that will definitely try and include them both in future might have to ask alexa to convert it for me great review guy i like how you show all the different drink option and most important temperature great to hear you both talking btw hearing both your opinion make for a good rounded review cheer for that glad you liked it will pas that on to my wife too she will be pleased to hear that would you prefer using the lattissima touch or the creatista pro creatista pro all the way for u i just clean my machine after i have finished making all the coffee needed i think this machine is an ideal one for the price it give you various drink and look stylish i have just fractured my wrist at work so coffee is keeping me going this machine ha been easy to use and thank goodness a my husband ha been making them thanks for the video a alway and a i have time i think i will watch them all again yeah the lattissimas are really easy machine to use are not they sorry to hear about your wrist but at least you will be able to relax and enjoy your coffee for a while i guess great video in your opinion gran lattissima or touch which one is the best it seems to be the size the only difference between them hi what about between lattissima one or touch do you think it worth getting touch instead of one taking price into consideration i would say the touch le drink option than the gran lattissima and the frother hold le milk but it is a nicely designed little machine and a lot cheaper great video been thinking about getting one for a while think you may have just persuaded me glad i could help informative video i chose the citiz over this after deciding it would be better to get that without milk frother and then buying the aerocino 4 separate on a completely separate note what is the correct way to make a cappuccino with a citiz and aero4 milk or coffee first how much milk every single video i watch on how to make one seems to be completely different and now even this one is apparently milk first then the coffee shot i have even watched yours but i feel like i am just making latte in cappuccino cup coffee first always then milk i use 100 ml of milk coffee go first then milk an froth on the top cheer ben i think it may be time for an updated how to make a cappuccino video on the channel a i did make it many year back with my first machine will have a play around with the aeroccino 4 and try to find the best way
1,A Review of the Nespresso Lattissima One Coffee Machine,i have bought the lattissima one a week ago the milk frother wa not working at all from the very beginning a i wa having problem with it i checked the customer review and found a bunch of people who had the same issue a i did so i packed the machine and sent it back i do not recommend lattissima one at all i wa and still am very disappointed can i use it to make espresso only the truth review thank you sir hello yes you can just to let you know i bought the machine yesterday mine doe not splatter milk and look messy like that furthermore i prefer the lattissima because it is an all in one machine and cleaning is not a big fuzz you can pour some hot water into a jug and disassemble the milk frother and rinse it like that usually take me 30 second my milk frother is outlet pipe is also positioned on the corner the presentation is so nice with the cup of coffee that i feel sad to stir it everytime so i guess the 2022 model is a much better range  i have this machine for 6 month now and it absolutely fantastic with no issue good to make a single glass of latte small and compact machine you need to use the extender part for shorter mug to prevent the splash this machine is way better than the frothing canister about time delongi got something right oh ya this machine is pod are compatible to the segafreddo zanetti pod online which are only 60c per pod for a pack of 90 espresso casa coffee capsule that is a bargain for this machine where can i find ur old machine and frother it is still for sale just search for nespresso citiz and milk  i get your point about the presentation part but most of the time you will make coffe in a cup and not a glass so the milk splashing will be kinda invisible also i have watched other test video milk quantity issue wa not present and there wa not a much splash maybe yours is faulty love our nespresso lattissima one no such thing for u that is of milk foam splashing around like in your review nice machine i have a nespresso machine nice machine ok folk we bought lattissima one used off of amazon and it did the spitting thing everytime but once 12 time total i am a troubleshooting kinda guy so i bought a whole new frothing assm for dollar51 it did the exact same thing but i did not quit at the time we received the new frother we had two smooth perfect cup no spitting no hissing without milk froth perfect smooth froth operation so what wa it i went back to what i did differently and replicated it over and over again with both frothing unit this is what i have learned i prestaged the frother with milk and put the whole unit in the fridge normally i fill it with milk to just above the low mark setting or at the high mark work perfectly everytime also with no left over milk in the unit oh the clear flexable tube get pushed all the way to the top but i leave a very slight gap where the two round part come together my thinking is that the orings or whatever in the frothing assm at refridgerator temperature have contracted to a better fit hopefully you all get the same result i have in total now aprox 30 pod used without a frothing issue robk it seem that you didnt have fully connected the milk tube or the container itself to the device this is why the milk did not come out smoothly and there wa also a surplus left in the container because of air in the system thanks so much for this video super informative and you helped me in making the decision of which nespresso machine to get i purchased the citiz my dad ha had the citz for year i had mine six year great choice it is not premium it is just price anchored to make the consumer think it is thanks for this video it wa very informative coffee run out far too slowly and no it is not scaled up we have soft water infuriating it take so long the coffee is instantly drinkable when the cup ha finally filled up i think i have had relationship which were shorter hello i would like to know the reason for replacing the milk cup thx for the review though i would have bought the lattissima just because i love the color lol but i did not know that those detail you mentioned were so annoying apparently for a lot of people but now that i saw your review i will not buy it gross can you drop link of your oun coffe machine pls we didnt find it from internet this is the money is no object best home machine i have tested this the nespresso machine i use daily great review thank you bought this a my first pod machine first time used it the milk did not pour but watched your review and realised thst i had attached the black connector at the back of the milk jug durectly to the machine and then i attached the milk jug to it rather attaching it to the milk jug first then attaching the entire thing to the machine rookie mistake no issue with a messy pour but my latte glass wa not a tall a yours and the milk poured at a lower angle a well yes it doe drip but once you know that you can move the cup away in time to keep the froth clean looking found the manual a bit tricky but did find that it said you can do more than one cup before cleaning a long a not too long between make your review wa very helpful but it only coffee for me so i am fairly satisfied with this model for a first machine thanks because of this review i will not be buying that machine thank you so much hi there what is the name of the older machine you used to have the nespresso citiz amp milk presentation wise it look like i have to work to get to my coffee xd click the lungo button first and then click the milk frother after and then use the drip catcher to catch the excess from the capsule you will get a bigger volume and milk wa all used up cheer you have prevented me from wasting my money great review i think you did not properly clean the machine this would have avoided the mess and would have used the proper amount of milk it also look like you did the review and were already biased towards your old machine i cleaned it a per the instruction in the manual if my memory is correct it wa dishwasher or soak 30 min the fact others have reported the same issue show this is not isolated there is no reason for me to have a biased towards any machine to be honest so should i just buy the old one instead of the lattisima one if you drink mainly espresso and drink if that nature buy the citiz had mine for 6 year if you drink americano style drink buy the vertuo a it contains twice the coffee in a single capsule and is better for tall cup of coffee with little to no milk very helpful video thank you so much brother i had this wishlisted on amazon not anymore great review now looking at the magimix thank you for this i wa actually considering purchasing this machine but now i definitely wont every negative you pointed out would piss me off to no end it is 2021 and i am here to say thank you for this review i do not think it is compatible with whole milk so basically the new machine is shit cleaning the frother unit doe not mean you have to take apart all the part of the rapid cappuccino system and wash them after each usage it mean you have to turn the milk froth regulator knob to the clean position so that the rinsing process start and hot water combined with steam flow and purge the nozzle there are quite a few video in youtube which explains this process i recently got this coffee machine and tbh it wa defective the milk frother would only dispense the milk but not the coffee unfortunately i would have to return it back idk if should even get a replacement though doesnt seem like it worth having either you used the wrong milk you used fresh milk can i use oat milk instead of regular milk you can you can use any type of milk with it most milk do not froth much the platform with a little hole in the top is there to mount your cup on when dispensing the coffee when you do this it will not splash all over the place i laughed when i saw you had a cup on the bottom and thought of course it is going to splash your review wa a bit unfair in that regard do rinse the rapid cappuccino system with dish soap from time to time if your rapid cappuccino system only produce a cappuccino amount of milk when you filled it up to a latte amount of milk you need to replace your milk frothing unit send the machine back to combat the dripping for the lattisima one machine flip the lid that it used to reveal the capsule holder a few time the rest of the coffee should drop nicely into your cup then get the last drop of coffee by using the rim of the inside of the cup thank you for your honest review i truly appreciate your video very good review thanks not sure what the guy and girl in switzerland are thinking about buy all these new machine are poorly made and design ha been lost in translation just returned the latest big capsule machine which ppppp out coffee like from mcdonald is very disappointed with nespresso hope this machine you reviewed will do the job nespresso pricing is completely crazy now so i reckon nespresso ha lost it magic over last few year any idea of the song in the back reminds me of stellaris i got the same issue in taiwan it finally work good after i send it back four time i told the customer service to remind the engineer the milk issue and if the issue remained i will return it thanks god at least that customer service is good but this product really give me hard time fantastic video camera best i have seen for long time this machine is a bit disapointing thanks for sharing i love my latissima no issue on my end i think it is made for their brand of cup i have had this machine for about a week now and absolutely love it the milk frother should not stop at that point a i have used it a few time now for a cappuccino for my wife and it is used the correct amount every single time so there is probably something wrong there with the sensor or something it drip quite a bit with any drink i do but i just leave the cup underneath it for an extra 10 second to let it finish when you wa making the drink with a glass of that shape i thjnk it would of been worth moving the higher drip tray off completely but also to note the froth did seem very erratic nothing in what i have seen with mine it is a shame that you did not enjoy it a i love mine i am using mine for myself a i am the black coffee lungo and espresso drinker and the milk coffee my wife is but she mainly is a tea drinker so she would not use the machine a i would so it kinda is a perfect machine for u a i type this i see you using another sized cup yes that is annoying a i got the recipe view glass and that is the perfect size for it you should not have to do it that i know but i thought i would mention it appreciate the review anyways i love espresso i enjoy espresso at the magnifica s in delonghi thank you for the very interesting video with love from japan i will come back again but if your reviewing a product do make sure to use a proper cup not a water glass this is so helpful i wa just going to get one and ended up not same i am looking for a espresso machine and wa considering this one but i think i will just buy the old one he ha thx almost bought one online where we can get a part of the machine if it is broken the truth review thank you so much if you call nespresso they will help they do have amazing customer service amazing review thank you i just bought mine 3 day ago but the bigger one than this one and i am much happier i use the nespresso at work and i have no issue using all the milk and cleaning the milk jug take second jessie jiang regular milk i am in australia great machine hello may i ask what time of milk are you using in the container and how is your machine doing now since i am willing to buy this machine would like to have your suggestion thank you a lot she is so busty if anyone ha it and doe not know how to descale this machine behind the water tank is the descaling nozzle which plug into the milk frother hose when you remove it very easy but it doe take a while to descale maybe it is how many coffee we throw into this machine daily but actually in the middle of a descale and it is taken over 30 minute already probably my fault actually but you can see the difference when your getting close to time of descaling needed very helpful thank you soo much i think this would be a better review if it wa not comparing apple to orange thats a real review the commercial video show the milk froth go slowly and smoothly but in fact is not the real thing i will not mention the mess caused by the milk in the glass there is got to be something wrong with that milk foamed maybe the part are not properly seated we were told by the nespresso store in central london when we tried to change the machine over yet again that the issue we had the worker there had seen many time not ever machine may have these issue but it certainly is much more than a one off there are some amazing nespresso machine and we use two of them daily just not this particular machine this is the one i wa most looking forward to but unfortunately the one i wa also most disappointed with after numerous unit all exhibiting issue thanks great review i agree with your comment interesting how these product seem to have actually gone backwards wash this glass for god sake lol how can i will clean in said i recently purchased mine and must say i am very happy enjoying amazing coffee i use chilled milk so it doe not splutter out of the frother i find the frother super easy to clean i do that 1x daily take le than 1min under running water my friend who have the aeroccino say they have to clean it frequently a well my only niggle is that my latt glass almost fill over because of the froth thanks for the review we too went from the citiz machine to these a while ago now and have had none of those issue the steam from the milk frothed is to be expected a it is steamed milk easy to rinse all of the part and all the milk frothed part go in the dishwasher which i love yes the water tank is smaller but i am not drinking that much coffee in 1 day for it to be an issue so i recommend it the white is so pretty which is why i wanted it but definitely not gunna pay 400 for it to even have one problem for some reason my machine doe not behave like what you have i wonder if they tune adjust the milk frother after hearing so many complains and i am completely satisfied with the machine i got mine delivered last week and i love it no problem whatsoever although they suggest using cow milk i am using oat milk and it make a lovely cappuccino you presented the way you wanted i do not face any such issue what a ball ache good review thanks i totally agree with you thanks for the video i do not like coffee pod not environmentally friendly send them back to nespresso free and they will recycle them i have been sending mine back for two year they also collect them if you order the coffee online and get delivered can you use your own coffee ground alexandra rodriguez there are reusable capsule you can get from amazon that you can fill with your own ground coffee even through the nespresso machine suck you do realize that when you place a normal mug of coffee at the machine you are suppose to place the square dripping box under the mug right i mean duh so that way the milk throther doe not squirt the milk everywhere you have that black mug really farther down without the dripping box but again nespresso machine suck thank you very much you helped me decide not buying this one very bad design of the milk frother can i also only get out milk very good thorough review you nailed on each of my concern from buying this based on what i read from reddit seems that they is a qa issue despite how beautiful the machine is lavazza the best expensive but the best thank for saving me money good review thank you for your review i like white color but based on your review i decided not to buy started watching because i wa thinking of purchasing the lattissima now i think i need a magimix instead this is a very helpful review great video thanks i have had two machine so far on both the first one and the replacement machine i wa sent the milk button doe not work at all the first machine it stopped working after about 6 latte and the replacement machine only worked one time and the button stopped working do not buy this machine so glad i saw this review i wa thinking of purchasing this appreciate the video sir is the magimix a nespresso machine what is the model of your magimix thank you i like good design but that is a little bit expensive for me your clip make me decided i can buy the coffee machine that low cost price around 150 290 usd and buy separate the one steaming milk machine sorry for my english is not good t t had exactly the same issue i could not believe what a cheap afterthought the cup stand drip tray is i think the cleaning light mean the milk container just need flushing with water rather than a full disassemble clean this is done by pressing a button on ours we had the same previous machine and wish we would kept it stop hating i absolutely love mine best purchase i have ever made not one issue i am not sure what is wrong with your milk frothed but that is not what happens to me agreed love mine i think the cup you used just did not work for this machine i have the same one and i agree on a lot of this but i have never had presentation or nozzle issue i just a shorter cup and it work will for me thank you for the review i wa about to finger to buy this machine after two year which do you recommend to buy the truth review thank you so much for your reply i really appreciate hi glad you liked it if you want a nespresso machine i would go with the vertuo or citiz if money is no object and you are happy to use whole bean nothing beat the sage the barista touch i wa about two finger to buy this machine i will never do it i am deciding to buy this it is currently on special at david jones here in australia for dollar319 my mum been eyeing on a coffee machine for a long time wa going to get it a a surprise gift but now after watching this idk kevin this wa so helpful i wanted to just get the milk frother warmer bc i use a french press but i wa debating on this machine i would have been soooo sad presentation is so important to me my coffee is my peaceful meditation time also quality is crucial amp the frothing for half the milk is literally ridiculous my aunt ha the other machine so i know the milk froth perfect thank you iwont buy it it is 1 30 am in the washington dc area usa what i learned tonight fuck the lattissima this is not quite right i have this machine and the milk frother work very well doe not splash around the glass and doe not leave any milk left in the container look like there is an issue with this one i am very happy with mine had a lot of other comment saying they had same issue maybe you got lucky with yours you can program the button and the amount of milk and coffee you want to set and he gon na remember that much milk and coffee i just saved 200euros thank you for your review great review glad saw it before i ordered which i will not now the truth review thank you i just bought this and i hate it the coffee is watery i have this machine and i absolutely love it but i have to admit your machine really seems weird i have only had the milk come out erratically when i have not cleaned the milk container in between once and it always us up all the milk the coffee is delicious and creamy i even make non coffee latte with it like beetroot and turmeric and they are awesome also according to the manual if should be the rapid cappuccino system should be dish washed specially handwashed not just rinsed in between i do not think that is a huge issue i want the machine to last a long a possible and take good care of it jessie jiang do you mean what type of milk i use dairy milk but sometimes also almond and oat milk almond milk doe not work so great but barista oat milk get foamed up almost a well a dairy milk but they do not advise using non dairy milk though i have had it for 1 5yrs now and it is doing really well work a well a day one i would recommend it hello may i ask what time of milk are you using in the container and how is your machine doing now since i am willing to buy this machine would like to have your suggestion thank you a lot i think it is debatable what is considered a premium product i do not think anything below gbp250 is not really a premium price bracket so price wise most nespresso do not have a premium price great video i have got your old one and a vertuo i think their more focused on profit from pod rather than machine i think it is debatable what is considered a premium product i do not think anything below gbp250 is really a premium price bracket so price wise most nespresso do not have a premium price great video i have got your old one and a vertuo i think their more focused on profit from pod rather than machine so glad i watched this same here glad you liked it reviewing the newer pro model of this one next week thank you i used this to help decide which one to buy rubbish waste of money should change the title to bbc machine destroys virgin wc machine i have bought it a few day ago the first to time cappuccino wa good and the milk creamed i have no idea what got wrong but since then it wa impossible to make a got cappuccino mostly because milk wa not creamy enough do you guy have any idea what can i do are you using the same type of milk if the milk tube clean thanks so much great review sadly they seemed to have gone the unfortunate route of sacrificing substance for style for this one it sure look nicer and more ismart but it function anything but that you need to keep that old fashioned versatility sometimes hallo ich nutze meine lattissima touch seit jahren bin super zufrieden super kaffee habe ich ausf hrlich dokumentiert is the milk foam saved me from spending 200 buck on this thanks great video i wa already tempted to not buy this machine due to the amount of piece i would have to dissemble in order to clean the milk part which is always necessary after using it after seeing this video i am really sure not to buy it great video and comparison i am better off with my u machine plus the aeroccino 3 a in your case child pick nespresso coffee bean in guatamala good review thank you nadiaswalhaanndfamily a you have just brought one great video that is one shoddy looking latte i have no idea why you would use such a large glass just bought this i have none of the problem you have 10 month still going strong atm i agree 100percent i have had mine for a year and we love it actually have 3 different nespresso machine and the lattisima pro is a beast i also have the separate milk frother and yes if frothing milk for multiple people using the separate one is much better it look like in his review the machine might have been saved to give le coffee possibly the machine did not froth enough because of the coffee setting that i can not answer but i do love my machine alexandra rodriguez good question probably not but that why they make manual machine that why i want to get a manual one can you use your own coffee ground thanks that is video rlly helped me so glad i did not buy this nespresso is not true espresso anyway i have had two nespresso machine and they worked great but they are just brewed coffee with aerated foam not true crema my nespresso breville creatista plus could froth milk like a jet engine though highly recommend that one excellent machine so tl dr piece of trash machine do not buy what would beyonce do love that mug thanks for the review l wa considering trying lt out but l think i will just stick with my vertuo which l love anyway this one look too messy thank you for the video still bought it work 100percent good your machine obviously have a milk pump issue in the user manual say clearly all the milk will be used the truth review did not noticed that but yeah i got lucky maybe it is clearly an issue with more than our machine considering how many comment here from people with the same issue and considering the machine we tried all had these issue too thanks for your honest review i wa dying to get this coffee machine but no thanks not anymore might just be the hype of that machine i wa eyeballing this machine for so long seen them on display in debenhams before and thought it looked really good especially to have a a desk coffee machine but i am really put off by how awful the presentation of drink and how little that milk container is the machine itself look really nice but now i have seen this and the price tag of it i think i will avoid dislike you did not preheat the machine before adding the milk nor did you properly cycle it before it is first use this review is an unjust and you are misleading people thanks for this review you just saved me some money also you have beautiful lesbian hand put the milk container in the fridge bam milk not wasted tried nespresso hated it got an expresso machine nothing work best like the real deal instant coffee hell no where did you buy the base for your citiz machine and aeroccino i bought this a year ago and have experienced all the problem you described honestly such a waste of money will be buying the pixie and aeroccino on sale to replace it melissa yes i bought the pixie and still love it no problem so far did you buy the pixie do you like it better any problem great review really clear not for me i do not like that coffe machine i do not think you are suppose to get the aeroccino wet all that water on the bottom might cause some issue i got the lattissima one yesterday for christmas and am experiencing all the issue you have described extremely disappointed will be sending mine back wish i would seen this review earlier the price is mostly for the how machine look thank you so much for this interesting review i wa confused what to buy but now i am totally deciding to buy the magimix omg thank you for this review it is really helpful i wa thinking to buy this new machine but now of course i do not thank you thank you thank you great review by the way love every detail hi there i just got this machine yesterday it wa between this and the expert with the nespresso subscription and i think either there is something wrong with your milk component or the machine wa revised or something the stream of milk that came out of mine tried 3 time already always consistent is steady and the cup wa totally emptied everytime i used skim milk btw actually really liked the machine preffer the black one that i got tho it seems very hit and miss we tested another unit and it had the same issue a the one we noted in our review thank you 3 word breville barista express same here wa just about to consider buying this at macy is they have a 48percent off sale coming up on black friday great review well done good review i like the look of the nespresso yet i also prefer convenience i am looking for an espresso maker and i came across the nespresso i think i will go to the traditional espresso maker wa looking at this for black friday and this made me decide not to get it thank you same here really helpful review thanks for your insight  thanks for this video it helped me to decide not to buy it thanks thanks the wife in a robe is a very nice touch your using the wrong milk you do not use blue topped milk that is y u have milk left y can only use red or green topped milk in these type of machine you can use blue topped milk in stand alone milk frother like your magimix blue top is full fat milk from everything i have read it is best to use full day milk for frothing one of many article that agrees can be read here i think i would return it good review thank you hi any link to the black old machine that you have look like one that is nice and reliable lasted seven year easy to use and clean only issue is milk frother had to be replaced three time  so glad i watched this thank you what kind of nespresso machine is the one that you prefer in this video the truth review the evoluo make a full cup of coffee too that is why i am not sure which one to get because i do not know what the difference between the two model is daniella morello if you like a coffee that ha more than a shot of espresso in it like a tall cup of coffee the whole range like the vertuo are great because they contain far more coffee inside the much bigger capsule the truth review thank you what do you think of the evoluo i am deciding between that and the vertuo i am looking at different vertuo item on qvc com right now since many are on sale the vertuo is the best one i have ever used and around 100 pound i have a full review coming in 48 hour of it tyvm for your very honest review this helped me tremendously i had this machine and the milk system wa so much trouble so i got the lattissima touch instead you should definitely check the lattissima touch if you are interested in milk drink beautiful machine to the eye not a good coffe machine the magimix is what i had at my old job which i hated seeing the magimix brings back bad memory and repressed memory not of the coffee machine but of the actual job itself lol funny how your mind work is not it the magimix is quite a good machine though thank you for the honest and detailed review of the product the comparison wa very helpful i have the same coffee machine and at first i had the same issue not all milk wa used in latte preparation then i went to nespesso shop to complain and they advise me to use a specific milk here in nl i use houdbare melk or long life whole milk from the shelf not from the fridge you have to use it cold and then the result is fantastic and yes after every single latte you have to clean but i am the only one drinking latte at home so for me it is not a big issue i also use oat or soya milk and then you also do not get that much foam what the duck is that eeri background music good for good and helpful review thank you for an honest review you need to know that s a machine for the original line of nespresso short cup the biggest size you can get on that it a lungo of 110 ml hi i think you got unlucky with your machine mine is fine with the milk frother it doe not spew and us all of the milk here is mine in action i had to watch this before getting lattissima one my it doe not seem to even work for latte i literally just ordered this 10 min ago catherine gab i saw couple of review it did not spray milk out of the cup so we are good wow me too hahah dan same here i just bought it u have a problem with the choice of your cup first of all the we can talk about the machine mr maxwell who fucking drink coffee in a tall glass cup if you need to use very specific coffee cup to make up for the bad design then this coffee machine suck i suffered every second you were showing the cleaning process so much water wa wasted buena comparativa gracias por compartir thanks for the review wa just about to order one from john lewis but looking at that nah i will skip have this machine and out the box i have had none of these issue aside from the few drop of froth spillage a lot of comment from people who have had all these issue it may not be an issue with every single unit but it is an issue with quiet a few you have to disassemble the entire milk frother and wash it with soup given milk is oily and fatty how come you have not had this issue same here dude my gf just bought the new version like 10 min ago and i am watching this video and i want to return it right away should have seen the video before spending this amount of money i always watch video of appliance i want to buy it is best to i am glad i watched this one saved me from making a mistake you are so annoying just enjoy your fckn latte or go to a starbucks i bought the latissima tried it for one day and hated it got rid of it and went back to my old machine the milk came out with froth on top like burned disgusting taste and smell it take forever to clean all the seperate part every time absolutely horrible experience how can they be proud of all the shit machine they make then advertise them a if they are some sort of premium high grade equipment i have had mine for 2 month and love it i have used almond milk and whole milk both work great would highly recommend easy to clean too i definitely think u used the wrong type of cup it is too tall for the machine so the milk dispenser sits almost vertically on the cup no wonder the mill spill out no matter the cup or mug it spurt out how match do you buy the old nespresso machine gbp170 thanks for this i almost got it but i only use mug and wa nervous about the cleaning good video music name thanks very informative review i appreciate that i wonder if your old coffee machine is milk frother got burned i had one of the oldest first nespresso machine that had that problem and it wa hard for me to clean every time i have seen weapon easier to clean than that nespresso squirting machine i have this machine and have none of the problem you show here the milk is all used up and doe not spurt apart from the initial burst of steam the coffee is very hot which is how i like it using both the latte and cappuccino mode i am more than happy with mine i do think a shorter glass may serve you better a even the latte setting would go no way toward filling that tall glass of yours jessie jiang i used skim milk i sold the machine to someone who wanted it to use in their caravan a couple of month ago a i have now upgraded to a bigger non capsule machine hello may i ask what time of milk are you using in the container and how is your machine doing now since i am willing to buy this machine would like to have your suggestion thank you a lot black colored machine is from which company r both from same yes why would the milk go first depends on the coffee for a latte it is milk first doe it froth soy milk not very well at all neither do any of the other machine we tested that used nespresso frother first of all you need to use glass that are appropriate for latte those taper inwards and make the opening smaller in the top i will call it a user error i will also call the coffee mug try a user error it is the first time i have seen anyone using a nasty mug you got from your easter egg or similar source not a normal coffee mug when using it you should have have elevated it up to the milk spout there seem to be some fault with the machine too since it did not use all the milk unless you pressed the wrong button maybe do not use that silly glass you have a faulty machine so this is anything but a truth review i bought one last week and it work perfectly the frother us all the milk it doe not spurt out so the presentation is perfect the latte look like a pint of guinness except it is brown and not black nice milky frothy head on top it taste great too delighted with it it is funny all the people who have said here that they would have bought this machine if not for this review have just denied themselves a good machine because of this poor review they may have ended up buying a poorer quality machine instead if your machine behaves like yours you take it back and keep doing so until it working properly posting a review of a faulty machine is not the truth thank you have a lovely rest of your day stepjen doyle i am sorry you say it is not the truth yet look at the number of people who have said they have had the same issue happy your machine is ok but many people have had the same fault i have had he said he tried two machine and both had the same issue if there a chance i am facing with a dollar400 machine i would like to know upfront to avoid the hassle this wa a fantastic review glad you did not face these issue but do not put other people down because you did not have the same experience doyler369 i guess they are all faulty because mine did the exact same thing and the one that i purchased for my mom did not use all the milk and wa sloppy thankful for your review i wa considering this machine not going to buy it due to the milk frother bad design they should have angled it differently how do you make hot chocolate with this machine that much froth is unnecessary it is not a latte anymore my machine used all the milk i can pull the metal spout part down and make it longer not sure if it is made to do this or if it is just for cleaning the milk part is much easier to clean than the old lattisima machine who us a tall glass for that that little thing which clip to the base is probably the most useful thing on that machine to extract a plain expresso to put an expresso cup on the baseplate will give you a cold shot a the liquid would have had to travel a much longer distance that square piece on which a tipycal expresso cup would rest would give you an optimum shot of expresso i do not think you need that much froth lol coffee is the main ingredient not milk depends on what type a latte definitely ha more milk than coffee finally somebody that it review of this machine i wa thinking about buying this for my father for christmas honest clear review no bullshit thank you very useful review thanks arent semi automatic more easy i have been using one of these for 6 year at my workplace gt gt gt ur2 pl 1166 they always produce good quality espresso and are very easy to work with the steamer work better than any other machine i have used for the same price range ours ha held up for year with 20 us each day even when the machine ha broken down by user error it been very easy to fix highly recommend spam they want you to buy the machine through amazon so they get a cut so helpful thank you maybe you should have done some research and gone for the latissimia touch a far better machine thanks for review wa just about to purchase this on a black friday weekend deal decided to check youtube and your review just saved me money not going to buy this one damn me too u saved me also thanks a lot dude same here same here too messy i have one i think his is broken mine not like that at all one year later black friday i wa about to do the same thing now after watching the video i will keep using my old machine by the way same a in the review and will save myself quite a bit of money thank you i think you got confusing result because the new machine requires cold milk to create the proper forth while your old one is best if the milk is not cold because it doe not warm the milk hot enough nesprsso is a big fail excellent review i do not want none now thanks for your review i wa decided to get a one or a touch but take these two separately probably is more rational i think you can adjust how much milk come out thanks for the review i will definitely pas on this great review thanks  really useful nearly bought this a look so compact and clean i will stick with the separate aerocinno thing separate milk frother very useful can make other cold drink and hot drink even if you want like a hot choc i use my frother good idea we did the same nespresso is highly overrated and overpriced i will get a real espresso machine when my creatista reach it end of life myami onfire you wont regret it peace of shit why nespresso form over function sadly i have an older machine with similar functionality and you can adjust both the milk and coffee flow amount hmmm that macine is a po hope you sent it back anybody used the miele need to know before l buy nespresso are amazing when they work but sob story when u have probs l have are soooo many design suggestion and improvement for them ha anyone tried the one with pad not pod found in the big hotel they go into slot like a letterbox so nothing to open close keep posting gr8 vids and review thanks the squirt of milk make the cup disgusting dear lord christ what are you a member of the house of lord just clean the glass cup it is a cappuccino per dio lmaoooooo there are better make such a la nuova simonelli illy or kimbo those two are fruity consumer make doge di amalfi l do realise that italian coffee and machine are the best in the world gaggia and lavazza mmmm come to mind but gaggia are very pricey and to get a flavour of that experience abroad in italy at home in the uk the best way possible and most pleasurable surely is maximum enjoyment l am not sure if l mentioned before but respect given to the whole experience make it more pleasurable the same tea blend served in a china cup always seems to taste nicer somehow than when served in a mug do you agree now it been proved by a japanese guy that if you behave nicely to water the actual crystal when frozen are a more perfect shape than ice crystal made from water that is treated badly so maybe there is something in it please see masaru motu on wikipedia for more information if you are interested so there may be something in it who know l think it different if you want a beverage quickly or you are relaxing and unwinding with a friend where you may want something a little more special please also consider that the coffee experience is relatively new to the uk which wa always seen a an american drink or an exotic continental drink in the uk we have moved a long long way from maxwell house coffee granule you must admit also l have no wish to offend anyone it is all personal taste and what may be seen normal in italy is luxury in the uk where a cup of coffee from starbux served in a paper cup is gbp3 4 in italy l have been to venice and bari a cup of italian coffee is about euros2 gbp1 70 and in italy you get a porcelain cup and saucer and friendly service and a southern italian like me should learn the pleasure and culture of coffee drinking from who do not be ridiculous this is just a tantrum of an englishman with no culture of coffee at all i used to be a cook in very high end restaurant when i wa young when this happened we did not throw away the dish we cleaned it ridiculous and pretentious of someone who stuff himself with food true display of our easy and comfortable life culture of coffee come from peasant not from royal court it all part of the pleasure and culture of coffee drinking if you do not bother about appearance then one simply will find oneself back in the stone age have you seen the japanese drink tea that will blow your mind if your ok with messy coffee imbibing thanks for your honest review i am definitely not investing cleaning after every use is ridiculous lyndon well it is like starbucks you have to clean the milk frother everyday so the milk doe not build into the machine and create bacteria thanks for the review we almost got this one because i really liked the color big fan of white but your review wa very thorough and you stated point that i never would have thought about thanks again from someone who ha never owned a nespresso machine before u can ajust the milk that go into the cup just keep pressing the latte botton till it get to the quantity that you desire and it done my loyal citiz of at least 6 year ha just started to leak i have opened it all up and replaced the o ring but it still will not work properly so now i am sadly looking for a new one in case i can not get it fixed thanks for your video i do not think this machine is the one for me im a bit late in commenting but you can call nespresso and tell them the issue with your machine per policy they have to trouble shoot with you over the phone but once them determine it not functional they will offer an out of warrant discount toward a new machine you can have a 10 year old machine you bought from amazon and they will still give you the discount thank you so much i think this machine is more of a budget friendly all in one coffee machine you are probably better off getting a lattisima touch or pro a a automatic or all in one coffee machine or just stick with any other simpler machine from nespresso i have got a lattisima plus since about 4 or 5 year ago and it wa fantastic for both espresso and milk based coffee drink or just a cup of hot milk i now have just then got a inissia for my desk at work it wa not so bad either how much is it how doe such a flawed product even leave the factory total po surely you would hold the cup under the milk nozzle rather than angling it to try and get it into your cup we started with a separate aeroccino throther like yours and bought a lattissima one a i too thought it would be quicker and le fuss doing it all in one you get so much more steam from yours when making the milk and a lot more splutter ours wa very smooth and did use all the milk but it wa relatively cool too cool for me they sent me a replacement milk unit but it wa exactly the same too cold for my liking same issue with the dripping too in the end we shelved it and got a creatista plus which ha variable milk temperature with great profit come shitty quality wa you milk nor cold enough all machine sputter milk if it is too warm to start with are you sure you can not adjust the milk quantity having said that this machine see silly compared with the large milk container machine also your coffee cup look like a glass have you tried the large milk tank machine it is great cleaning on it is a button and it steam clean the milk container in place to clean it i think your comparing orange and apple here i have looked at this new one and can not understand why the have made it especially if a you say you have to wash out the milk container by hand every time thanks for the video i will look at more the milk wa straight out of the fridge this is why it is better to buy a semi automatic espresso machine over a capsule machine i have the same milk problem maybe we are doing something wrong i wa disappointed too do not know if i would return it or not or maybe bc i am using milk 3 25percent happened to my citiz wa having more watery foam with this kind of milk will try with milk 2percent and will keep you updated mm can you update u ive just ordered the nespresso en550 b lattissima touch which is the bigger version with more capacity milk eye opening thnx embrassaing for delongi muchas gracias muy claro tu video ventajas y desventajas gracias also such beautiful hand omg i wa really thinking about buying the latissima one a it is so sleek and i thought it would do the job correctly i am glad you opened my eye you saved me quite a few buck same here it wa really a very informative review never really understood why people buy nespresso machine the capsule are expensive the coffee is not that good it is usually cold spend a lot more and buy a sage oracle light year ahead of these any of the sage range is the truth review i just googled it gbp190 is actually quite reasonable good point lol christ is that machine gbp500 i do not know how much it cost i never looked to be fair the oracle is gbp900 more than this machine this is too much work i have a nespresso vertuoline and it is the best easy to use and clean no problem at all nespresso is a scam for coffee true to each his or her own 92asc it is a scam a real shot of espresso contains 7 8 gram of coffee grind these capsule only contain 5 5 gram so in reality you are getting a watered down fake espresso shot espresso shot need to be extracted at above 200 degree these machine do not have the capability of that heat since they are made out of plastic in my opinion it is a scam at least starbucks is giving you the real deal i do not go a much anymore ever since i bought myself an espresso machine expensive yes a scam no also at 90 1 20 pod it could still be argued that it a bargain when you compare it to say a dollar5 coffee from starbucks john ambriz how what is your fave nespresso i am looking to buy and watched load of video and read load of review i am leaning towards the pixie strung99out hi i have for the last four year used the large milk tank nespresso machine i love their free trade coffee i do not get that much joy out of making my own from a standard machine but if you do live to do it all then nespresso is not for you you press a button on the milk container and it steam clean it then you store it in the fridge tiki next use i love the ease my fridge is very cold so i give my cappuccino a 15 second hit in the microwave a i like it very hot one last thing they have the best decaf i have ever had if you want the model no i will pas it on cheer i noticed this machine work good in term of size with nespreo accessory but in term of foam is kinda off thank you so much for this very thorough review i am in the process of deciding on nespresso model and found the explanation at the nespresso boutique to be very simplistic sorry got caught up with other review within 24 hour will be up the truth review still waiting glad you like it doing another one tomorrow for their new bluetooth machine  thanks for this a quick question which machine is quieter in your opinion for the espresso part not the milk part to be honest they are both equally a loud to me we are putting up a review tomorrow of the latest machine which should on paper be the one to get i have the same coffee machine it worked perfectly from the start but then one time i used milk that wa at room temperature and it did exactly what yours did since then i make sure the milk is chilled and have not had any problem since jow much manny of this muchine plz look like there is something wrong with your machine i have seen other video where all the milk is used and also the milk is not spilled i would return it to nespresso and have it replaced with a correctly working one patrick craenmehr just buy a semi automatic espresso machine and buy a good grinder you know what nespresso are so amazing with their customer service that if you tried this and you had the issue we had they would likely take it back without issue i know amazon gladly would too if you only make one cup of coffee at a time give this a go if you like and let u know how your experience is it is a good machine we just found it not a good a the older and cheaper model and built a tad on the flimsy side thank you for checking out the review have a lovely weekend the truth review ok that doe not sound so good i wa thinking of buying this machine but maybe that is not such a good idea after all btw the lattissima touch may be the better option for your usage since it ha a larger milk container for more than one cup glass of cappuccino or latte machiato we went through 3 machine before we got one that did not spurt milk all over the counter top however due to having to constantly refill the milk attachment if both me and my partner wanted coffee in the morning and the longer cleaning time all be it only by 1 minute longer we decided to stick with the older machine one of the other main reason is if we have guest and want to make 3 4 cup of coffee we can fill up the milk department just once instead of 3 4 time like we would have to do on the newer machine we also feel the old machine feel more solid and far le flimsy great review thank you it is making me second guess purchasing one of these now thanks for the review your presentation for the machine is elegant and informative i just bought it a few day ago and i am wondering what is the best pod for making a cappuccino i end up getting the light pink one rosabaya and so far so good but i am open to any suggestion everyone here universally love the vanilla vanillo they call it one and the duls o do brasil is also one that go super quick in the office unfortunately the vanilla is not included with the machine if you have a nespresso store near you they all have free tasting section might be worth trying the different flavour out thanks for the detailed review i just purchased this nespresso model for dollar197 on bed bath and beyond they are having a sale plus the 20percent off is eligible hopefully the milk dispenser ha an easy fix did you prime it when we contacted nespresso to find out if this wa an issue they had heard of the lady on the phone said she had dealt with a few complaint that day the truth review i have tested mine today and it work great i primed my nespresso like the instruction stated and had no issue with the milk i am actually kind of surprised with the result i have been a keurig user for awhile now so this is a big upgrade for me hi no i ordered it directly from nespresso they have an offer at the moment with gbp60 worth of free coffee with any order of a coffee machine

little door below the milk container a well if you grab the silver cover from the right side and pull it is a hinge door with some attachment sadly i have no idea what it doe it is for descaling the

are they expensive favorite capsule are the vanillo white with stripe and whatever the pink one is god everything it make is like crack nice video but i wish you would shown the cappuccino to see the frother in action which is how i judge a really good machine but again thanks for the info very helpful this video could have been half the time if you did not chunter on his chanter ing wa actually quite informative a very nice and simple video helped me choose to purchase this for the wife i have got a delonghi coffee machine with the frother and my miss find it to complicated to use she will love this one for sure thank you man how big of a cup i am finding it doe not fill my cup up my coffee cup are too large how many oz should i get for a cappachino cup if you want cappucino then use a cappucino cup and not a coffee cup love the video but what did you mean you have to order pod from nespresso can not you buy them from supermarket david whitfield amazon so i can not just use supermarket coffee pod with this machine do you get any annoying drip down the side of the cup from the milk frothing doe this make coffee it make milk to answer your question it make espresso hence the nespresso name because it also froth milk it can make a cappuccino or latte if you do not know the difference between espresso and coffee google it i am pretty sure it made water nope it made juice i have to thank you i am currently babysitting and could not find how to turn on this machine same here legit doing the same thing morganthefox lol omg i am doing the same thing thanks very helpful can i reprogram it when you talk about getting a much coffee a you want i am assuming that is from the same capsule is the coffee the same strength if you get more coffee from the capsule it is not a cup it is a jar what do you do with the extra milk if you do not need it you have to put in back into the fridge stephiso grab some oreo and dunk em stephiso grab some oreo and dunk em yes the container go into the fridge for future usage thanks for the video great video thanks good to the point video thanks cu l c psula prefieres para capuchino y cu l para el latte is anyone here concerned about the amount of plastic waste created by modern coffee maker machine please consider buying a reusable coffee capsule for this particular brand let is be responsible people this one look pretty good because i am planning on buying this machine nope totally agree with you i will not buy something like this although i loved it purely because of all those little capsule being thrown away and then where do they land up nespresso capsule are simple metal and 100percent recyclable via both their own program or anywhere that recycles soda can franklyn espinal nespresso us an aluminum pod no plastic sir you can recycle these capsule at most grocery store here in switzerland i would not have bought one otherwise thank you you did a great job in this video is this the en520 how are you liking the taste compared to the local wawa or dunkin donut latte thank you sir had it for a couple of month i did not know about cleaning and programming very informative btw they call it lungo not double espresso  butchpouka not only is it lungo lungo doe not mean double a lungo is a long single how would you make a double shot latte nice review thanks i am a cheapskate i run each pod twice yeah i know it is weaker but two pod per drink thats a bit pricey p shelley freeman press the top right button and then wait 1 minute and press it again shelley freeman you could always just put another pod in after the latte process finish and brew a second shot right on top i am so happy you made a review this wa in great detail thank you  just got one and i love it i made the same mistake with milk dispenser excellent review i have the same machine and one of our technique is how the coffee more hot longer enough well we warm our cup in the microwave with a little half teaspoon sugar it depeends how sweet you like and one teaspoon water for about 30 sec one thing about this machine is they also automatic switch off this is the best explanation that i have seen finally programed my machine the right way you can use the clean feature to heat the milk tube and heat up the cup prior to making a cup nice pre heating feature how many onces did you set it up to latte and cappuccino great review just got mine and the cappuccino is just 1 4 cup full great review thanks best video on this machine i did not understand the programming mode until i watched this thanks for posting thank you for the helpful review great review and the best on youtube for this machine very interesting information on the programmable latte and cappucino section helpful yes lovde to learn about the programmable part one other good thing is you if you have leftover milk you can detach the milk container from the unit and then put it in the fridge you just have to make sure you purge clean the milk frother before you detach it to get all the milk out of the spout so it doesnt go off nespresso recommend that you only keep the milk container in the fridge with milk for around 2 3 day for hygiene purpose soooo boring excellent thanks bro this vid would let me think twice before buying an iphone though hahahaha i think the coffee could be hotter i do not like my coffee too hot but even i find it is not hot i know a bit of a contradiction what i am saying is coffee not hot enough i had the same problem with this machine until i started to heat the cup using the milk steamer is cleaner function to steam the cup beforehand this way the cup is hot and the milk come out hotter especially for your first cup than it normally would problem solved enjoy thank you very much firteen888 you saved my husband and i precious time trying to figure out what to do with our nespresso machine love my nespresso lattissima congrats nestl for this magic machine if i program a button for my personal use and then later decides that i want it like it wa when i bought it programed by nespresso how can i get the same amount that wa from the beginning ash gaming channel thanks crippa1983 press all four button simultaneously till it blink then u r set ash gaming channel okey cool how u can reset it to the point and honest review thanks great review thanks good video however iphone 5 suck use something else for recording next time p thanks for the video i recently discovered the lunge and i do not see any difference in taste renee marie polarizan i do use the espresso capsule for cappuccino and it is fine i have the same machine i have a question i know that the button are programmable but can i control it every time i use it like every time because other people leave their own preference can it be or am i using it wrong also do u use an espresso capsule to make a cappuccino or can u use a lungo capsule a well sorry i am a newbie the milk in the container stay cold it only heat up a it come out the rest is still cold so you can store the rest back in the fridge with no probs thanks man got my machine today great video thanks for posting get mine today it the best nespresso machine is the milk in the container hot or is it possible to save the leftover in the fridge oh i can not believe i had this machine for 8 month without using it i wa too lazy to read the manual stumble across your video now i can not stop making my coffee thanks you so much firteen888 hi one quick question is it normal to find some water in the used capsule container why are you here thanks for the video and thanks for the tip on program the machine that really helped a lot thanks your camera focus is messing with me i have the same one but it give me not much cofee how do you program it to get more coffe thank you so much for your video i have read so many review and i wa not sure if it wa a great product or not your video sold me this machine i guess nespresso owes you a comission lol my husband will give me the machine for valentine is day i am all excited about it thanks again great video i just ordered mine yesterday waiting for it to arrive got the same color a yours you are correct in that there ar not very many good video concerning the lattissima plus took me some waffling before i finally commited to it and if i would have seen this video i would have ordered it about a week ago thx for the vid fyi the espresso button that you referred to in the back is not a double shot it is a lungo type shot which mean more water is pushed through the capsule therefore diluted think americano and you would use the lungo capsule a true double shot of espresso would be 2 capsule pushing the front espresso button

5,How to use Delonghi Nespresso Lattissima coffee machine,wa hoping to see the milk frother working cleaning and how to put together again this replaced a smaller keurig that i owned for 6 year mybest kitchen i wanted the convenience of the water receptacle and while this unit is much larger than the previous one i am very happy with my purchase the only downside to this larger model is having to move it from under the cabinet to place the pod and refill it i wa able to rectify this by purchasing glide mat for small appliance now it is perfect very informative thank you but the use of the word literally wa in 50percent of his sentence thank you so much i love you are you single hahaha just kidding i saw your ring lol thank you perfect video balissimo take too long from flashing light to

fryer noted your feedback i stop it a soon a it start looking watery thanks for sharing why did not you show the attachment in the little compartment beneath the milk container and how to use it or is this a different version from the one i have that is used to descale the machine you put the attachment in the hole where the milk container usually go and then the cappuccino light will turn orange you press it and it descales the machine if you have the descale solution in literally can the volume of a cappuccino and latte be set at different level sorry but you have not much empathy for people who use this for the first time you do not show how to drop the capsule what side hi constantia de gier thank you for your feedback noted your comment the capsule or pod should be put into the machine model nespresso en520w shown with the flat foil face of the pod facing you this is shown in the video at around 3mins 18seconds thanks my milk frother doe not work no milk come out just press for a

the hot water through the machine without a pod thanks hi i just wondering a we so new to this my dad amp i if my dad want a black coffee but he would like hot milk instead of cold milk can we do it the tech guru l the tech guru thanks for getting back to me i will try it out with my dad at the weekend hi amanda thanks for your message yes the machine dispenses hot milk but a a latte or cappuccino in term of black coffee with a touch of hot milk i have never made it like this and have normally made a black coffee cappuccino or latte the machine delivers milk first or not at all however i guess you could make a black coffee by pressing either left hand button according to cup size then get the machine to dispense hot milk a if a latte right hand button and then stop it shortly after the required amount of milk ha been added by pressing same right hand button again just need to ensure your cup size and amount of liquid dispensed are set okay on the black coffee delivery it should work in fact i will try this myself at some point thanks thanks so much for your easy way of explaining how to use this machine i received it for my birthday this month but could not be bothered reading the book video demo is the way for me happy new year from australia hi barbara thanks for your kind message i am glad you found my video useful enjoy your coffee a happy new year to you too i purchased this machine and have never owned one before doe any pod do to make cappuccino your video helped me so thanks hi anne thanks for your kind message i am glad my video helped

additional water to make an americano please reply a i am about to purchase thank you very much for your quick reply i have just purchased this machine a a chirstmas gift hi luck this machine can make espresso 40ml lungo 110ml cappuccino and latte an americano is simply one or two shot of espresso topped up with water you can therefore brew one or two capsule of your favourite espresso blend eject the capsule and top up with plain water from the machine according to taste many thanks blew my load watching this couldnt make it past the slow mo milk spurt i like it but there not nearly enough george clooney in this ad secondly i would like for it to have smart feature for home automation and lastly there too much cleaning involved gt lt no matter which machine you have you should always clean it after use it called hygiene  ehwexdgxh hello there i have an issue with my nespresso coffee machine i long pressed the second button the button right below the clean button now the machine is making a very light taste coffee with too much milk how to solve it too much trouble i think i will stick to my tassimo is it ok to press the cappuccino button twice using the same capsule one cappuccino give 50 ml milk 40 ml coffee which is 90ml in total not enough or should i make a 180ml drink out of two capsule yoav yakir 7 the answer is you keep pressing the latte macchiato button till it fill the glass nalminji did you figure out the answer i am just making the latte macchiato for now which is 3 time the milk to fill out a cup can you make a cappuccino or latte macchiato using a lungo pod will it pour the same amount of water a an espresso pod or more water i have programmed the latte macchiato for a lungo pod do it with water only first to be sure of the volume the cappuchino is still for a single pod and milk with the factory setting the cappuccino and latte macchiato button will pour an espresso cup for the coffee portion regardless of the capsule used however you can reprogram them to pour a lungo cup by following the direction in the user manual please send u an email through the contact u page on nespresso com if you have any other question and have a great day you are meant to clean the milk dispenser every 2 day are you serious that is a lot more complex to clean than an aeroccino which ha fewer part to dismantle and is much quicker to clean no need to soak in water for 30 min round aeroccino is just like a milk foamer not steamed milk shane have you compared froth quality it is an important detail ok jet0 sh ndetsh m the aeroccino doe not steam milk rather it is an aerater lol lostn65 you push the clean button job done plus it froth the milk 100x better than the aeroccino asadov koroglv    zz maria carmelita geraldo susumu okazaki

simple never been more turned on lmao that is funny because this instruction video ha a nice warm flow going on and on i really appreciate the very clear instructional coffee machine video do not get me wrong but with all this porn music i do not think i have ever been more turned on by an instructional coffee machine video they did not give u any solution and i watched the video and went to buy it but they do not sell it they said u have to bring your machine and pay for the service with the high cost of their coffee capsule you could eventually afford a high end fully automatic coffee barista machine like a jura or something and use any coffee you want i do not know much about them or which is the better brand but it take me two capsule using my latissimo pro for a descent cup of espresso or cappuccino am i the only one that spends a fortune for their coffee they make it sound cheaper but they price it per capsule multiply that by ten and you have spent dollar7 20 on their cheapest sleeve the only selling point for this corporation is the recycling this make everyone who care about our environment feel guilty if they do not buy one and there are a lot of people in that category including me i feel cheated and especially mislead by by their famous and well respected spokesperson george clooney he could care le what it cost the consumer to use these machine he is obviously in that filthy rich 10percent that hold all the wealth but you can not buy a clean planet earth can you george you must be broke if you talk like this if you can not afford it then you should try something cheaper nespresso never said it is cheap it is luxury nothing happened even after i pressed the orange light albtoul almufleh you are not supposed to press the orange light you are supposed to press the cup that is lit nothing come through for me after i press the cappucino button  hey elise send u a pm via facebook about the issue you are having with your machine and we will be sure to provide some troubleshooting assistance cheer  so stupid they do not print these on all the paper they give you in the box instead it talk about how it poison each machine is different

go to work the tip you do not need to buy their expensive descale solution cheap food grade citric acid will do just fine i just went to tesco uk and got their descaler it wa dirt cheap that i can not remember the price if you guy are saying the nespresso descaler is costly then do not bother with it they do the same job legally and safely the solution here netherlands cost about 5euros and you get two satchel tom barry in the uk i use the fine coffee company descaler it cost about 60p and work just a well you have to buy 100 of their pod for free delivery but they taste ok and are a lot cheaper than nespresso and i stock up on the descalers tom barry six dollar for a little bag of solution is expensive and unnecessary martin zhang hi i used citric avid and water solution but now the milk

not do anything how do i descale without the packet nespresso ok thanks hi there the descaling kit solution need to be purchased separately from your machine please contact your local nespresso club to purchase many thanks why the fuck have delonghi nespresso not supplied a descale container instead of expecting u to balance a container precariously on the edge of the machine the amount of time i have had to clean up spilt liquid because there is nothing you can safely balance in front of the machine of sufficient size i use a cereal bowl and it hold the amount of liquid from the container with the discaler the g dawg era literally just use two large mug they only need to be about 350ml each what is scaling dirt grossy stuff calcium carbonate build up water contains mineral that eventually precipitate a deposites inside the water path arturo toledo when you have a machine like a water cooker which a the name implies us water time after time water will dry up and a white chalky substance will appear and those are scale that stuff doe not taste good and is not good for your health either so you descale it over time water used during brewing may cause internal mineral buildup called scale which can affect the flow temperature and overall performance of your machine descaling dissolve and remove the scale what is descaling or scaling could you explain thanks we

cycle so disguarded 2 coffee made after so i think more rinsing is needed jamie jmc i agree i redo the descaling with plain water after descaling with solution because of this is this machine built to last i read a ton of negative feedback in amazon about this unit not working after 1 to 4 week and serious doubt to the quality of customer service i want to get one but i am not sure mine is approximately four and a half year old and ha not given a hint of trouble a truly excellent little machine  i know you asked a few month ago but i have used over 1 000 capsule in my lattissima over the last year plus and it still work just a well a the day i bought it i have recommended machine to family and friend and theirs are still going strong a well my understanding is that all of their machine use the same extractor mechanism made in italy

10,Nespresso Lattissima One Coffee Machine Review | Drinks made with milk frother + heat and taste test,i have this machine for 6 month now and it absolutely fantastic with no issue good to make a single glass of latte small and compact machine great to hear hi new to coffee machine here when making double espresso with this machine do you need to change the pod hi i do a feel the amount of coffee in the pod will be right for a single espresso think i tried getting 2 shot out of 1 pod when i first got my machine but it ha been a while might give it a go again one time just to see how it taste just got this for christmas and absolutely love it hi love the review i wa wondering where you got the capsule holder you have there on the right side thanks that one is the pure rock dispenser available on the nespresso website hi i do not understand what you said on 6 45min there is a possibility to rince clean the latte stuff just in push one button or not a2b production ok thanks it seems it is possible with the new mod le en510 hi there no there is no clean button on this machine i am afraid just a light to remind you to clean it after each use and you are supposed to take the frother apart and wash it out after every use hope this help i love your review ty most ppl do not know how to use this one so i am glad you got good result glad they have been helpful thanks 25 second is too long imo i love your video my question i can not decide between the lattissima one lattissima touch or citiz and milk what are your thought they are all in the price range i would like to spend the same here hi there they all have their pro and con but i personally like the citiz and milk a the frother is more versatile i prefer the texture of the froth though the lattissima one froth wa not bad and feel the aeroccino will be le temperamental over time hope this help lattissima touch or lattissima one we really need to do some v video with these machine a they are very different depends a lot on how many milk based coffee you drink each day i think worth keeping in mind you have to wash the frother out between every milk coffee you make with the lattissima one whereas you can use the touch frother give it a quick blast with the steam clean function and keep it in the fridge for up to 2 day might be worth watching our lattissima touch review hi mate can u make 2 cappuccino with one pod or will they only make one thanks a2b production ok cheer i would not of thought so to hi there i have not tried it a it is only recommended to use one pod per shot of espresso i might give it a go one time to try it but i would not imagine the second shot would taste very nice i wa just wondering if you put warm water in milk holder insteed of milk and let it run a if your using milk would that not clean it all or flush all milk leftover i did that with the older version and it worked fantastic please let me know what you think gr ernie in holland hi there i am wary of suggesting alternative way of cleaning the machine apart from what nespresso suggest in case it break anything or leaf bacteria in the frother but sound like a clever idea and glad it ha worked for you in the past i do not like to much milk in my coffee so can i add even le milk than normal level will it still work giving le milk please let me know iam thinking of buying one hi there think i may have responded to this on another video but the machine will just use whatever amount of milk you put in so if you want le then i do not see a problem with just adding a bit le milk than the cappuccino line great review please can you make a iced coffee with cold milk or it is always going to be hot thanks i want to get one for my and i do not know witch one is better this one or citiz with aerocino 3 hi there it just ha the one button so it will always dispense hot milk the aeroccino 3 or 4 can both froth cold milk great video again thanks so much thanks hope it helped can you give it le milk to coffee hi there then machine basically us whatever amount of milk you put in the frother minus a little left at the bottom where the tube will not reach so yes i think you could put a little le in to suit your taste hope this help when i make a latte the machine did not use all milk in the container i think the machine only use 2 3 of the milk any idea why any option to minimise the milk waste yeah i am trying to remember i think it did that for u too a the tube inside might not go all the way down to the base of the frother not sure there is much that can be done about that though i have the lattissima one and i love my nespresso the taste of the coffee is amazing hello thank you so much for your help did you need to wash the milk container between your cappuccino and latte macchiato i am afraid to buy this machine because i do not want to wash the milk container after every single use but gran latissima ha bad review thank you so much for your help yes this one is only designed for single use and need to be washed within 30 minute of use each time according to the manual my milk frother doest foam a2b production wy my machine dosent foam sorry to hear that probably best to get in touch with nespresso which one is better the nespresso latissima one or latissima touch i have lattissima touch and i love it a2b production thank you so much for the clarification hi there we did prefer the texture of the milk from the lattissima one but the touch doe have extra option so it just depends on what you want from the machine do you have a way to get a bit le foam with this machine i meant le foam yeah thank you for replying hi there no there is no adjustment dial on this model i am afraid if you mean literally le milk instead of a le airy foam then you could just put le milk in the frother i guess a it just us however much you put in hey im tryinb to search the na e of the touch milk frother appearing on the left of the coffee machine unfortunately i can not reach out to the product name what issue did you have with your gran lat i bought one and the milk part would only produce steam and water nespresso are going to replace it also the machine doe not remember programmed amount hi there our frother on the gran lattissima worked ok but we just did not really like the kind of froth it created too airy and a you mentioned a bit watery can you adjust the amount of coffee that come out after the milk come out you can adjust the coffee volume for the espresso but not 100percent sure if it applies the change when making the a latte or cappuccino might be worth double checking with nespresso hey do you know the difference between delonghi lattissima one en500b and nespresso lattissima one en500b hi there the lattissimas i have had direct from nespresso to date have been de longhi machine so would imagine they are both the same machine hi i am buying my partner our first nespresso machine for xmas i have watched your video and still slightly unsure he love latte i wa thinking latisima one but now i am thinking standard machine with separate frother can you help please no problem and thanks for letting u know hope you like them both a2b production hi i have opted for the citize and the areocinno 4 thanks for all your help yeah being honest i would go for a separate machine and frother myself i love latte and if there is a chance of stretching to the creatista plus i would opt for that over any lattissima know they are not cheap though so would personally still go for a cheaper machine plus aeroccino 4 just so you do not have to remove the spring when you want le froth and it ha an extra froth setting when you want more would recommend watching more of the video though a will hopefully help you to decide how did you make the latte machiato hi there we filled it to just above the top line on the frother the machine basically us whatever milk is in the milk carafe so you just need to put the required amount in hope this help do the machine stop dripping if you eject the pod immediately after use or do they continue to drip after ejecting the pod a2b production thanks for the quick reply i guess we will just have to get use to it then and keep an eye on the drip or keep the tray slid across when we are done just brought the touch from amazon gbp155 thought i wa a decent deal considering it wa gbp201 yesterday so we will see what it is like over the weekend they do tend to keep dripping even after ejecting the pod it is more noticeable on these than other some nespresso machine too a when making the bigger drink there is no drip tray in place to catch the drip afterwards unless you can remember and get into the habit of just sliding that drip tray over a soon a you are done making a latte then wash that drip tray out when needed i just received my machine and the milk frother did not work on my 2nd cup same with my machine any news about it sorry to hear that have heard report of lattissima milk frothers malfunctioning but it ha not happened yet on my machine hope you get it sorted under the warranty another great video i like your new intro keep going love your review lt 3 cheer mate appreciate that and glad you like the intro is this suitable for 2 people who drink coffee 2 time daily a2b production thanks for information reply in that case i should get lattissima touch or gran lattissima could perhaps make it work but may be a bit of a faff if it is 4 milk based coffee you are making a you will need to fill the frother 4 time and wash it out a couple of time a day hi do you think i should get the latissimo one or a citiz and aeroccino 4 your video are really helpful isabelle hi isabelle i am wondering exactly the same especially a someone who want to make a lot of cappuccino and would love to use different milk option it seems like the more reliable option to go for the citiz aeroccino 4 or even a frother from a different brand a there is really good one out there have you made a decision yet would love to hear some opinion before i make my purchase a2b production thank you so much can not wait for your new video hi there glad the video are helping everyone ha different priority but personally i would go for the citiz and aeroccino i have had that combination twice now and my old combo wa still going after 5 or so year also feel the aeroccino milk mix better with the coffee but that is all down to personal taste i guess great video i am still firm in the believe of keeping it simple using a basic machine and an aeroccino the latissimi one look like a lot of work yeah i still prefer an aeroccino to the lattissimas a prefer the froth consistency and think the aeroccino will stand up better over time usually just a cheap whisk replacement too if an aeroccino stop frothing could you do a comparison of lattisima one milk frother v aeroccino a2b production awesome looking forward think that would be a great comparison so will definitely get that sorted thanks i can not believe the difference between this one and the grand lattissima the milk container is so much more smaller and need topping up after every drink i have learned a lot a i do agree it doe drip and i have had the little stand on the wrong way round many thanks a always for great informative video and please keep them coming haha glad it wa not just me yeah i wa taken back initially with how small it wa but started to make more sense when i thought about it being a machine for someone who like simplicity and only a very occasional milk drink perhaps once a week or something hi nice review can i make only hot milk with this machine maybe without coffee pot wa thinking about this after and i do not see why not if you remove the cup or glass after the milk ha finished let the water pour into the drip tray and then empty it a ever another great review loving the graphic for the fahrenheit temperature much appreciated very convenient machine but not for lover of hot coffee glad those measurement worked for you yeah it is a shame a the espresso temperature is quite good but the milk just let it down
11,DeLonghi Lattissima Nespresso Capsule Coffee Machine EN680,expected lifespan is around 10 year then it will start to leak then you will have to buy a new one because there is no part availability or repair cost are too high to make it worthwhile mug do not fit under the nozzle you need tapered cup which are impossible to find nespresso doe not even sell them the milk container is a pain in the arse to clean you can not get into the corner easily i use a paper towel wrapped around a chopstick which have a tendency to break apart from this it is a great machine i use mine every day the large water tank is a good feature too 
12,DeLonghi Nespresso Lattissima Pro Overview,will this machine make just plain cup of coffee a well hi matt thanks for the question it is not quite a plain old cup of coffee but you can make a lungo which is a larger size espresso another option and better than drip coffee imo is to make an americano which is an espresso with hot water added marc is this the best capsule machine out there i wa wondering if you can make an iced variation of drink with this machine or can you change the temperature setting or milk frothing temp setting where can i buy the flat round mug in 3 56 hi s thanks for the question it is not a glass we sell think i picked that one up at a thrift store i believe it is actually a style of tea cup marc yes it is a nearly 6 year 9old video but the lattissima pro is still king of the nespresso hill in term of automated espresso amp milk drink one observation they should have cleaned the tip of the espresso nozzle that milk foam on there is not how to professionally present a product do i sound obsessive name a coffee fan that isnt while i see what you mean it wa just a little splash and i am glad it wa not edited out a i wa wondering whether this unit would spatter and how much this look minimal and a simple wipe after use would make the spatter easy for me to live with hi john thanks for the comment yes always keep the wand clean please turn off the annoying music hi db sorry you found our theme music annoying how much spent capsule can the bin hold hi thanks have you reviewed the creatista plus what is your recommendation compared to this fully automated machine hi round thanks for the question it hold 15 spent capsule more info here the milk doe not run a smooth like that it kinda sprout everywhere hi the most common reason for issue with milk system is dirty component if one follows the instruction this machine is brilliant if you are having trouble with the frothing and like me assumed that the frother did not need a completely pull apart clean then do this before shooting of the mouth this machine is back in working order and is just a brilliant a i originally thought it wa so people please disregard my original comment and follow the instruction even if you clean the spout after every milk coffee it just need that little bit more luv my machine hi can i use hot chocolate pod in the pro one do you no please hi nigel they must be from a third party a nespresso doe not make their own capsule for hot chocolate using third party capsule would likely void a nespresso machine warranty whole latte love yes they are hi nigel are they nespresso capsule wow talk about murphy is law have just finished leaving a massive top review for this machine loved it today i went to use it and the milk frother is not working i have followed all the instruction since it wa new about 3 week ago except i do not have a dishwashing machine to wash the milk frother in bugger judy jennings hey do not sweat it glad to hear you are loving the machine again thanks for letting u know the cleaning solved it there is yellow stuff all over my face egg i have only had the machine for le than 3 week so assumed wrongly that it would not need a big pull frother apart clean so soon my big mistake i did this ran extremely hot water thru it all and low and behold it is back in working order so with humble apology i am once again madly in love with this excellent machine hi judy most milk frothing problem are caused by dirty frothing component make sure all the component are free of milk residue tiny milk deposit build up and effect frothing performance should not have to be run through dishwasher to clean how hot is the milk most of these automatic milk machine only get to about 140f hi hp 135f to 150f is a proper milk temp for best flavor it is where milk gain most perceived sweetness from heating also it is what you will get from a skilled barista at a quality cafe most all super auto machine will make froth in that temp range for that reason how loud is this machine if i use it in my apartment should i be worried about my neighbor complaining in the morning about noise if you are worried about your neighbor hearing your espresso machine i would worry first when if you go into the washroom and drop a huge fart before shitting maybe that will wake them up before the machine what the fuck apartment is that curtain wall max factor exactly then what else can the neighbour hear if you really worry that a coffee machine might wake your neighbor up it is time to change house do not think noise will be a problem unless you wall are very thin i love my lattissima touch awesome thanks for sharing your video an actual review would have be nice instead of a 5 minute commercial can you use other brand like tassimo and make tea with it nespresso machine only work with nespresso capsule it seems there may be some 3rd party making a tea capsule that fit nespresso machine we have not tried them and it is likely nespresso doe not endorse their use it may void a warranty ai not it a bitch to extract a capsule from a machine that ha to be so hard really can you add a much milk to a shot a you want i like a double espresso with milk added to fill an 11oz cup milw55 my pleasure awesome thanks yes you can amount of milk and espresso are programmable can you adjust the strength of the coffee half strength etc thank you for the video whole latte love thank you ngatiramona you are welcome strength can be adujsted by changing the volume of water put through the coffee thanks for the nespresso ad at 2 09 i thought the glass wa going to fall off the damn machine a it shimmied to the right gt lt dear dear internet user avoid investment on these nexpresso machine indeed one of their capsule blew my machine and it ha led to a power outage during my first contact with their customer service drama i spent several day making a complaint about this incident and neglect wa considerable and they have rejected their responsibility by asking me to pay for their expertise or to buy another machine knowing that the incident wa caused by their capsule product my typewriter krups cost euro 354 do not invest in these machine you will end up losing your investment if you consider coffee machine investment then id consider you invest into some education justine palabre hi justine sorry to hear you had problem with your machine here in the u s we have had no incident report similar to yours also surprised to hear you had any difficulty in your dealing with nespresso in our experience they have always supported their product with impeccable customer service better than bean to cup jonathan foong i guess you are right but i had chosen the nesspresso and quite happy with it just hope the capsule could be bigger so i can enjoy more in every cup thanks for the info though nothing beat bean nespresso is ground and packed for week to month so the freshness will not be there you have to sacrifice freshness for convenience michael cheung nespresso us exceptionally high quality coffee and their packaging process help with freshness in the end it is a matter of opinion we have never been disappointed with their coffee you give up some flexibility a compared to bean to cup but gain convenience i can not say anything bad about this system had it now for 3months just best coffey and fast threechthedruid what kind of pod do you use any recommendation hamzy k ok i have had no problem still just cleaning it like every 4 5 monts thats all hamzy k yeap still nice are you guy hired by ne espresso company they are resellers just like they said in the video mario bros doe it matter this is an excellent demo who care who pay them better than being unemployed

recipe preprogrammed espresso lungo cappuccino latte macchiato creamy latte amp warm milk it also ha a larger milk container learn more here is it possible to just get milk out of it shanu i believe the unit is going to run water with every cycle however the lattisima touch model doe have a milk only function with a larger milk reservoir learn more here i think this is the best review i have ever watch on youtube a lot of coffee maker video are not detail and non sense b but this one really tell you and show you everything lol thanks for your kind word can you make a regular latte not a latte macchiato best tutorial i have seen thank you everything kitchen hi can you kindly link to all the glass featured thanks glad it wa helpful ottima recensione grazie where to buy those glass we carry those on everythingktichens com i love the zwilling double wall cup and here is the taller luigi bormioli macchiato cup is it me or doe the crema look more of a artificial foam rather then a nice true creamy crema i have been using nespresso for more than 10 year and i can tell you it is creamy crema that is so good are the coffee hot i find many machine are not hot enough thanks everything kitchen thanks so much for the reply tarn yes the coffee produced is hot a common issue is that people will use a room temperature cup for their espresso which will cool it down quickly to combat this you can run a coffee program with no espresso pod installed to make hot water and add it to your mug to pre heat the mug use this heated mug for your drink now this will prevent luke warm coffee very well done love the product and got a a gift question when using the froth option is it an espresso measurement or lungo i am use to using a frother to top my lungo this seems to be a shorter pour hi ty you for the vedio but i have to clean the milk container after each cup this will be so boring and is it going to stop making another cup if i m not cleaning ty can you just get frothed milk out of the machine with no coffee pod how long doe it take to get it warm before getting the coffee not very long usually 30ish second hows the long term use of this machine everything kitchen hey thanks i also heard that machine with milk froth gunk up and get stuck doe this happen with this machine both nespresso and delonghi are very reliable brand you can expect a long lifespan from these manufacturer they even provide a 2 year limited manufacturer warranty for this model is that the maximum espresso u can quueeze from that machine or if u can press the button then more the first black espresso one rig the lungo button will produce more espresso than the standard espresso button in the manual there are direction to add or subtract water to each function to match your coffee preference i hope this help you have a very good presentation of this product and the use of lazy susan is genius thank you   everything kitchen  i have a vertuo plus and love it the electronic opening is good a i find on other machine like this one pushing down the capsule cover is a bit hard is it possible to make latte cap with a double shot or do i just hit the espresso button again after it is finished making the latte mrjdh1111 there are a few way to do this the lungo button will run more water through a single capsule to get more coffee but you will have a slightly weaker brew the same effect would happen if you ran the espresso button twice with the same pod to get a full strength double shot it will take 2 nespresso capsule each ran through the espresso button once you could experiment with the strength of each of these method to find what you like best hope this help component really look cheap michael escobedo that is because it is cheap any coffee machine le than a few thousand pound is cheap but sometimes cheap is ok if you can not for whatever reason get a decent machine this one only cost a few hundred pound so you get what you pay for recently started drinking oat milk so i guess i can not use oat milk in this machine right liliana garcia oat milk and other plant based milk will not produce foam the machine would probably heat and dispense the oat milk if you could i make ice drink maha yes you can make iced drink just run a shot or two of espresso into a glass add a flavored syrup then top with ice top with milk and stir to make an iced coffee great idea learning something new from your video i love the coffee machine too but the nespresso original pod is expensive for everyday use but now i find the new nice alternative for nespresso originalline pod help u to reduce waste of plastic pod and can be reuse more than 10 time for each brew a nice cup for every time hope you will enjoy my recommendation too i see that store in amazon ha promotion now you could check you like it or not just a share lol lydia z doe it work for this machine can you just put normal milk in the milk container florian fe he will love it we will ship it to you for free everything kitchen thanks im gon na but one for my dad yes normal milk will work with the frother what is the difference btw lattissima one en506 v f111 daniel angel did you mean the en560 not en506 the f111 look to be similar if not the exact model shown in this video the en560 is similar to this featured model but ha 6 drink function and a milk tank that is not only larger but ha the ability to control the amount of milk foam a well that model is here can you use any pod for all the coffee or is it a different type everything kitchen how much are they daniel 69 i understand now yes you can use any nespresso pod for an espresso or latte there are lungo pod that are made for the lungo button but you can do whatever pod you want with whatever button the machine doe not know which pod you insert i hope this help let u know if you have more question everything kitchen sorry did not word that properly can i use any nespresso pod for an espresso or latte or is there a specific pod for each daniel 69 you have to use a nespresso originalline compatible pod you can get these directly through nespresso com and also other third party pod are at store like trader joes and target help me i bought the machine two week ago and two day ago the milk machine did not work oh no that doe not sound good i would call delonghi directly to troubleshoot the issue 1 800 322 3848 the machine doe have a two year warranty and this might be something that it cover give them a call a soon a you can which pod come in the tasting pack malou bw i believe it is 10 different flavor that nespresso offer we have drank most of them already there is a tasting and flavor guide in the manual for each coffee variety i also will be demonstrating this machine tomorrow for the first time thank you so much for all your great information thank you i have to demo this machine for the first time tomorrow and i watched several review of it none wa a detailed and crystal clear a yours i still can not get it to make my cappuccino look simple here doubt my machine is broken only used it once glad we could help stay caffeinated can you use soy milk if you can is the result good jessica lo the manual state the milk system ha not been designed to work with vegetable milk it may heat up the soy milk but would probably not froth it i hope this help do you just press the latte button to make a latte or cappuccino if so how doe machine know if you have a espresso capsule or lungo capsule in a these would require a different amount of water steve m you are correct just press the latte button to make either a latte or cappuccino the latte button only us an espresso amount of water but us either a single or double portion of milk from the frothing container depending on how much milk you put into it the machine optically sens the amount of milk in the container to make a lungo you would press the lungo button the middle button i am buying a new machine that i used only twice i noticed all the machine is button are flashing and i do not know what to do waoud mohammad have you tried completely unplugging the unit and then plugging it back in if this doe not work call delonghi directly at 1 866 528 8323 do you need specific pod in order to use the latte cappuccino option or do all nespresso original pod work for that it is more environmentally friendly to use reusable one the pod used in most machine are very bad for the environment jenna ward all you need is the original nespresso pod for any of the function you only need to add milk to the frother portion of the machine if you want a latte or cappuccino change speed to 1 5 you are welcome yo poe where did you buy all the different glass used hemipwr321 we carry those on everythingktichens com i love the zwilling double wall cup and here is the taller luigi bormioli macchiato cup awesome review except for the fact you referred to every part of the machine a he or him instead of it  great video if you want to make 2 latte in a row can you just refill the milk and once complete with both do the cleaning then or do you have to do a clean after each latte michaeldee360 you could make two latte in a row without cleaning with no issue i just purchased one of these and this is the best video so far especially for a new espresso machine user thank you i did have a question though can you also adjust the amount of liquid dispersed for a cappuccino or latte i tried my first this morning and it did not seem to use all the milk hey i wa considering buying one but i have watched more review that talked about this issue the machine not using all the milk wa yours broken or did you get it fix same with me it did not use all the milk for the macchiato setting ashley rivera glad that we could help out a far a the milk go having a small amount leftover in the dispenser is common and normal with this unit you may try filling with just a tad more milk in the dispenser to see if that help please feel free to reach out to u if you have more question chef austin no self respecting chef make his own coffee that is what waiter and barrister are for mark eagleton my nespresso is my barista in a box at home i highly

16,Nespresso Lattissima Pro Coffee Machine Review - Worth the money? | De'longhi | A2B Productions,that wa excellent what i would really like to know after that is how much hot water come out in one go my current machine which is broken give out a full mug of hot water but it looked like you needed to start it a few time to get a full mug thanks glad you liked it will be unboxing the machine again at some some point soon for another video so will try and check the amount for you great honest review subscribed too few of those thanks thanks pal much appreciated i thought it could do americanos hi it can if you attach the water spout instead of the frother 2 or 3 shot of espresso followed by hot water or you could even press the lungo button once or twice with no pod in no dedicated americano button off the top of my head but perhaps ask nespresso the creatista pro ha a dedicated long black setting we have video on the channel about the above in case they are of interest thank you so much better than trying to read the manual trying to work out my new machine happy to help great video a always how much fatpercent is that milk the froth look amazing a2b production thanks hi there thanks it will be semi skimmed milk think that is about 1 5percent 2percent update i ended up returning the nepresso and bought the jura ena 8 think that is the model total upgrade and huge quality improvement good to hear you ended up with the right machine for you i keep watching your somewhat negative review on the lattisima and i love the machine it doe everything a it should no it doe not i have bought the machine 18 month ago and i stopped using it after a month or so because i wanted decent milk froth that did not collapse after a few second this expensive machine doe not produce good milk froth and if it is froth you are after stay away from this machine hi always great to hear different opinion i personally just prefer the texture of the milk froth from the aeroccino or creatista steam wand so find the milk based drink nicer using those guess that is why nespresso have so many different type of machine though something for everyone never understood why on those automatic machine the coffe is poured after the milk and not before do this in italy and you could get in serious trouble lmfao this is a huge mistake on a cappuccino if you put the milk before you will never have the nice coffee crema mixed with the milk the coffee crema need to stay on top always great review thanks i liked the way both of you commented glad you liked it and thanks hey lattissima pro or gran lattissima how the best hello my friend if it is 50percent off is it well worth the purchase hi there my honest reply would be it depends what discount are available on other machine if you know a lattissima is what you want then it probably is but even then the lattissima touch offer more setting all be it with a smaller frother for le money i like the creatista machine myself but they might not be to everyones taste sorry the answer is not more straightforward but it is a lot to spend if it is not the right machine for you a great independent review a always to be honest i still can not believe this machine is still part of the current nespresso line of machine the lattissima pro wa released in early 2014 a the top end lattissima machine with the lattissima plus being the main steam offering since the the lattissima range ha undergone quite a visual change but for some reason this pro model is still the same machine that wa released in 2014 and personally i think it look rather dated the other issue i see is that it suffers with the typical lattissima problem of luke warm coffee when making a milk based drink i honestly thought this pro model had a temperature setting but after watching this video it is clear it doe not what i can not seem to understand is why nespresso have not seemed to address this luke warm coffee issue that seems inherent in the lattissima range there is no way a milk based drink would be coming out of these machine at le than 65c when prepared and should be closer to 68c 70c to be getting 59c is just not hot enough and like i have mentioned in the past i have seen old lattissima plus not getting higher that 50c but classed a within specification by nespresso i am really sorry to bang the same old drum for me it is got to be a nespresso requirement that these lattissima machine can not make a milk drink hotter a my delonghi pain in the as to use bean to cup machine with auto latte system that these nespresso machine are based on ha no issue serving milk based drink at 70c consistently it also seems like the creatista range can be up to 10c hotter on the milk drink also so i just do not understand why these lattissima machine are not able to match the 65c 68c with milk based drink of the creatista range again the review is great and are a pleasure to watch a i try to decide which new nespresso machine to buy have a great week joff wow i did not realise it came out that early to be honest guess that explains the very dated looking screen best keep hold of it then in case they release a new version and i need to compare them cheer and hope you have a great week too would you recommend this or the creatista pro hi there if budget is not an issue then we prefer the creatista pro to be honest but we have just posted a video comparing the two machine in case that is of interest i am trying to decide on which nespresso machine to buy i think it is going to be the citiz or the lattisima however i am not sure which one is better if i want a milk frother the lattisima or citiz with an integrated milk frother or simply the basic citiz and then buy a milk frother seperatly thank you for the great and very informative video thanks for that glad you like the video if it help at all out of those choice i quite like the citiz and seperate aeroccino 4 milk frother a it ha an extra froth latte macchiato setting and you do not need to remove the spring if you want le froth it is also dishwasher safe though i guess you could buy whichever milk frother brand you wanted i just bought this machine 3 day ago and i am already having problem with it this morning i tried to pull an espresso and very little water wa extracted then it stopped and an error message came up on display saying system empty repeat delivery nespresso i had to restart over this time it worked however i had that message before also the power cord is way to short for my kitchen it only like 50cm or so that is very annoying have to buy an extension cord which wasnt my idea to have hanging around the kitchen counter i can not help to feel that this machine is cheap made and they are selling it for a premium i am on live chat with nespresso now will advise later really sorry to hear you are having problem and hope you manage to get them resolved cheer for sharing your experience though a sure it will be helpful to others i am enjoying all your video having recently discovered your channel best coffee related channel i have watched plus i love your wife is accent thanks for that and welcome aboard will pas that on to my wife in her own language too the reason there wa more foam in the latte and le in the cappuccino is you set the milk setting on the wrong side for the cappuccino you had it on the le froth and latte on the more froth hi yeah it seems to be what nespresso recommend a it is a latte macchiato the machine make rather then a latte the macchiato ha more froth than the cappuccino and think this bear out with the setting on the aeroccino 4 too it did take me by surprise when i watched the official nespresso video too a doe not seem natural to turn the froth to the lowest setting for a cappaccino doe it but doe not the machine read the type of coffee it is brewing is it a vertuo hi this one is an original machine so it doe not have the barcode system like the vertuoline in conparsion which is better the lattisma pro or the gran lattisma hi there just responded to your comment on the gran lattissima video what do you do with the others coffee machine you have gotten before thought i would best mention we did compare the creatista plus to the gran lattissima in another video though just in case that help anyone have kept most of them to compare with other machine in future have sold a couple but then regretted it when i realised i needed it for another video wanted to compare this one to the creatista plus for example but do not have that machine anymore too bad this model is not available in my country so i just made a purchase of the gran latissima model hope the gran lattissima doe the job for you what i do at home is i preheat my glass by pouring some water in it and put in the microwave oven for a minute or minute and half and then i make coffee of course i can not afford this espresso machine i just have a wacaco nanopresso and a lavazza milk frother cheer for some good tip i actually fancy having a play around with an aeropress or nanopresso one day too great review a always i am so happy i went for the lattissima touch after watching this it is le then half the price and in my view doe the same job you two are the king and queen of nespresso yeah we think the touch offer better value really glad you are happy with your purchase thanks too my wife will love that hi another great review i had one of the nespresso pro machine and i am sure that if you go into setting you can make other drink and even name your own favourite stay safe and merry christmas yeah i can do that on my creatista pro but could not seem to find any option for that on this one do love that feature on the creatista you too disappointing it doe not offer flat white watching this video having a morning cuppa it look extremely stylish and after your demo it is a nice machine i agree for that price there should be a quicker heating up time and far more coffee drink choice i would not use the hot water at all but that is my preference i am interested to see what other follower have to say so nice to hear your wife is opinion thanks very much yeah for the price you expect more do not you i think i would be using the kettle over the hot water spout too but guess it is a nice add on for those who do not have much counter space it is amazing how many people want to use the machine for hot water from the comment we have had in the past will pas that on to my wife thanks for the video my first choice machine because i like latte and cappuccino but i saw a lot of bad comment on amazon issue with the frother after few month of utilisation so i am thinking to buy milk frother separatly hello i have a latissima pro that is 6 year old and it still work but it ha started malfunctioning just a little system empty repeat delivery it rarely happens but it doe we loved it so much we wanted to buy a new one before this one quit however the new one the frother did not work it is not the actual frother bottle that doe not work because we tested the new bottle on our old machine and it work fine it ha to be the rapid cappuccino system itself some defect they repaired it and it worked for 2 week then it wa spitting out hot watery milk again they gave u a new machine and it only worked for 3 week before it just started sputtering out a few drop of hot water again the frother worked fine with our old machine but would not work on new one finally we told them to give u the creatista plus instead have not received it yet yeah i have seen a few review like that too but it ha not personally happened to me yet so did not feel right including it in the review will certainly do a follow up video if it doe happen in future though yes please compare to creatista pro get the creatista pro this thing is a disaster frother is problematic and drink are cold i just bought this bad boy for my christmas present to use on our boat hope you enjoy it mate

dann durchlaufen l sst nach diesem video dem ich blind vetraut habe habe ich die kaffeemaschine gekauft und bin leider bitter entt uscht davor e mus erw hnt werden hatte ich ein vorg ngermodell da wir bestimmt gute 7 8 jahre gebraucht haben mit mehr oder weniger erfolg da problem bei der neuen zwar sehr h bschen und leiseren kaffeemaschine ist die milch bzw der fehlende milchschaum da ist ein witz weder sch umt die maschine die milch richtig noch ist die milch richtig warm dadurch kann sich irgendwie auch der kaffee originalnespressokapseln im geschmack nicht richtig entfalten irgendwann lief die milch einfach durch die dr se hindurch ohne schaum dann meckerte die maschine weil die langhaltbare h milch au dem tetrapack mehr al drei tage alt war auch die reinung per hand aller vier teile de milchsch umers war kein erfolg erst nachdem ich die teile in der sp lmaschine gereinigt habe ging e besser aber alles sehr umst ndlich dy w rde bedeuten das ich al single der selten zu hause kocht und isst wegen der kaffeemaschine am besten jeden 2 tag meine sp lmaschine anschmei e damit sie die teile der lattissima reinigt nonsens mit umwelt und energieschutz hat da nichts zu tun und nervig ist e allemal leider weigert sich der h ndler die maschine zur ck zu nehmen hat jemand einen anderen tipp kann man da trotzdem al fehler deklarieren oder da problem irgendwie beheben danke f r die antworten nach 2 wochen milchsch umer defekt nach meine recherchen m sste auch die mycoffeestar barista edelstahl kapsel kompatibel sein aber ich trau mich nicht den hebel umzulegen f hlt sich an al w rde ich die maschine kaputt machen wei jmd mehr dazu kann ich auch wasser in den milchtank geben damit ich teewasser rauslassen kann tolles teil allerdings sch umt sie bei mir so gut wie gar nicht auf wie ist die maximale menge bei der lungo die man einstellen kann der milchschaum ist wirklich mega nice bessee al die touch  thanks greeting from holland wa passiert wenn da wasser ausgeht w hrend die maschine im laufe ist stoppt er von selbst oder ist e schlimm wenn kein wasser mehr im beh lter ist habe sie seit ein paar wochen und war auch erst sehr zufrieden seit ein paar tagen wird die milch berhaupt nicht mehr aufgesch umt habe nichts anderes gemacht al sonst auch  heisst da man im vergleich zur touch endlich mehrere latte s hintereinander zubereiten kann ohne jedes mal zu reinigen sp len mein milchsch umer funktioniert nicjt mehr hilfe hast du ihn gut gereinigt tolles teil wir haben auch eine hab sie mir danach gekauft super mega teil und extrem fancy hey sag mal hast du zuf llig auch einen account der fitnessbox hei t die stimme kommt mir so bekannt vor h tte schw ren k nnen und eine sportuhr an neeeein d kann man nur milchschaum ohne kaffee auch machen meine sch umt so schlecht quasi garnicht bin nicht sehr zufrieden hab auch viele verschiedene milchsorten und fettgehalte probiert nie da gleiche ergebnis  hallo toller bericht w rde gerne wissen ob man die kaffeemenge bei cappuccino oder latte macchiato einstellen kann danke im voraus ja koop een goeie machine bij apicus brielle met de benodigde garantie guter beitrag frage wo bekommt man denn die espresso tassen bei ca 0 14 im video die kann man in jedem nespresso shop oder auch online auf der homepage von nespresso bestellen gibt e den eine m glichkeit da mehr kaffe anstatt milch im latte machiato glas ist ich w rde erst die milch ohne kapsel durchlaufen lassen dann manuell stoppen und erst danach eine kapsel rein und die kaffee menge mit 3sek druck auf espresso taste manuell auf die gew nschte menge einstellen hello nice video are you interested in reviewing capsulier craft your own blend crossover with nespresso we can discus further by email thank you ist bei dir die milch mal nicht ganz rausgelaufen hab ein video gesehen wo da der fall war warum war da so also w rdest du sie empfehlen ale ist denn doe milch ausreichend f r ein latte macchiato oder ist die milchmenge zu wenig hab die maschine bestellt weil die auch mega aussieht und der milch beh lter genau f r 1 tasse reicht ohne milch zu verschwenden habe aber sorge da e f r ein latte macchiato zu wenig sein k nnte du meinst da video au uk da war die maschine scheinbar kaputt ich habe mir da ger t vor zwei monaten gekauft nur am anfang beim ersten hat die milch etwas rausgeschossen sonst nie wieder auch da mit der milch war quatsch da ger t saugt alles auf wie man e im video sehen kann ne mini pf tze bleibt die kann man aber danach mit reinwerfen war bisher echt zufrieden leider sch umt sie die milch nicht mehr auf dasselbe problem habe ich auch piefieg da ganze hallo sehr guter testbericht hab jedoch eine frage auf der verpackung sind ja nur diese 4 getr nke angezeigt kenne mich garnicht au mit den kapseln und den sorten usw aber k nnte man damit auch zb eine heisse schokolade machen mit der frischen milch im beh lter bzw gibt e auch von nespresso oder andren kompatiblen firmen kapseln f r kakao zb w rde mich sehr ber eine antwort freuen kann man mit dieser maschine auch die vanille kapseln usw von nespresso verwenden nein e gibt auf der nespresso seite eine kapsel mit espresso bitterschoko geschmack ciocattino aber f r hei e schokolade gibt e noch keine kapsel man kann mit der maschine espresso espresso lungo cappuccino und latte macchiato zubereiten man k nnte auch nur milchschaum zubereiten wenn man nur die milch aufsch umt und keine kapsel einlegt ausserdem gibt e nespresso kapseln von anderen anbietern wie jacob lavazza dallmayr und von discountern die auch kompatibel sind und deutlich g nstiger al die originalen nahed el sharif bin auch neu in der nespresso gemeinde e w rde mich auch sehr interessieren ob e kakao kapseln gibt welche maschine w rden sie pers nlich denn nehmen diese oder die qbo welche ist denn nach dem fazit besser hallo vielen dank f r da video ich mus den milchbeh lter jeden tag auseinander bauen oder gibt e auch eine funktion zum durchsp len die gibt e nicht so wird die reinigung eigentlich pflicht sehr kompakte machine hat irgend einer ein idee ob e auch mit sojamilch funktioniert hab gelesen da e funktioniert auch mut laktosefreier milch welche alternativ kapseln hast du denn genutzt linda02619 und wie sind die vom geschmack im vergleich zu den original kapseln e gibt mycups kapsel die gibts bei dm oder im internet und sind deutlich g nstiger bio und kompostierbar eine ganze reihe von kapseln die von m venpick jacob gourmesso hallo toller testbericht hat mir meine entscheidung sie zu kaufen sehr leicht gemacht und sie funktioniert
