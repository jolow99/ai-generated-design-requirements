21,the video mention that there are no ristretto option in this machine the coffee machine is actually programmable and you can pre program it to use different quantity of water and milk that is because we all like our coffee differently coffee volume is set at 40 ml espresso by standard but can be programmed to a little a 25 ml ristretto up to 200 ml the range for milk is 30 ml 200 ml also the milk froth can depend on the kind of milk used temperature and even the position of the nozzle refrigerated skimmed or semi skimmed milk is recommended in user guide all in all i think it is a great little machine for someone who doe not have super high standard for coffee but like a bit of special treat,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.5167278051376343, 0.4376770555973053, 0.04559517279267311]"
22,cheer for mentioning that it can be programmed for ristretto but wa just meaning it did not have a dedicated button for it a that can be a bit of a bind for people who want to switch easily between ristretto and espresso think the gran lattissima ha both of those button off the top of my head so that could be an option for those who want both and we have a review of that machine on the channel for those who might be interested in it,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5999628901481628, 0.3412455916404724, 0.05879157409071922]"
23,a friend made me a cup of coffee using this machine just this week and i loved it perhaps i am not the coffee connoisseur that some are but i really enjoyed this cup of coffee question though doe this machine steam the milk or merely froth it based on the temperature displayed it merely froth it right i currently have a nespresso machine and separate frother which work great how different is the touch model to the regular machine that cup of coffee did taste different better but maybe i am just imagining this,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8658819198608398, 0.08468777686357498, 0.04943032190203667]"

77,i would say the lattissima one ha been designed for espresso or lungo drinker who just want the option to have an occasional milk based coffee without having to have a separate milk frother on the worktop a for the espresso itself there is plenty of choice in the espresso range on the originalline machine and personally i prefer them to the vertuoline so it will all come down to whether you like the taste of nespresso coffee or not,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7795524597167969, 0.16632524132728577, 0.054122358560562134]"

82,i just bought this machine last weekend and i never tasted such a good coffee if you like a proper italian coffee with a thick foam of milk this machine really doe the job it is very easy to clean and if you put the used capsule out in the litter downstairs the machine stop dripping everything on this machine is great you can easy clean the milk reservoir also put it in the fridge you can instal your size of cup differently so these are no criterion you can choose for so many different tast of coffee so what you want bitter or sweet i think it is terrible most people put so much water with coffee this look and tasted like brown tea to me and ha nothing to do with coffee my only critical point is that for a real cappuccino you need first to put a ristretto and after you put than some foam on the top normally with a spoon so the milk doe not mix with the coffee but this machine doe first the milk than the coffee wel most people will not mind but this is not an cappuccino it doe tast anyhow very nice and also go with illy segrafredo and lavazza capsule which to me are the best coffeebrands in the world,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7163862586021423, 0.14603915810585022, 0.13757462799549103]"

116,it is a tough one due to the price difference you could probably survive with the touch but you will have to fill the milk and water up more regularly and also empty the used capsule holder more often my gut say gran lattissima but it is close because of the cost,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.67561274766922, 0.23783373832702637, 0.08655352890491486]"

120,hi there in case it help we do have more video on the channel on how to choose the right nespresso pod but personally would stick with an espresso 40ml pod for a latte with this machine even though i think nespresso recommend a lungo pod on some of the latte recipe on their website when using an aeroccino just about finding a pod intensity or flavour that work for you in fact would stick with an espresso shot for all of the drink on this machine unless you specifically want a lungo hope this help a bit but there are lot more video on the channel,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8822878003120422, 0.10309261828660965, 0.014619596302509308]"

129,hi mate yeah it would be a lot easier if they set the cup size correct from the start would not it like you say the different cup size are ratio of milk to coffee but also supposed to be different froth level too think nespresso recommend using the lowest froth level for cappuccino and highest for latte macchiato i would also be using the lowest level for a latte but would like an even lower froth level for the latte myself for a cappuccino 1 shot 40ml according to nespresso 100 ml of milk seems to work when using an aeroccino and barista recipe maker and the nespresso cappuccino cup are 180ml if that help to gauge thing a bit the latte latte macchiato recipe glass are 350 ml suppose trial and error and finding what taste best to you is the best way to go about it but completely agree they should set it right to start with and more info given a to what froth level to use for each drink can not remember if it say it in the manual though totally agree with what you say about the heat too cheer for dropping back on to give your experience,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7128040194511414, 0.1870613843202591, 0.10013461858034134]"

136,hi jack sorry to hear that mate so i would say this is better than the atelier on taste but still not the best we have actually just published a review of the lattissima one and that wa better taste wise but we would still go for an aeroccino barista maker or creatista over any of the lattissimas we have tried up to now should have a review of the lattissima pro coming soon hope this help,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.5695862770080566, 0.3023272156715393, 0.12808647751808167]"
137,a great review but overall i do not think this is an improvement over the lattissima that i currently own in storage and replaced with delonghi cappuccino bean to cup machine the main problem is the temperature of the milk based drink and which are usually le than 60c once dispensed and not hot enough it seems this revision continues this and still ha the same issue with luke warm milk drink the temperature issue is something that nespresso are asking delonghi to program and condition into the lattissima range a their bean to cup version that i have dispenses a milk based drink at least 8c 10c hotter and at a more acceptable temperature but are both very similar especially in the way they dispense milk the temperature thing wa my main reason from moving from nespresso pod machine to a bean to cup and although the new range of nespresso machine do look great they still seem to have the same old too cool temperature dispense issue awesome review and very informative please keep up the great video joff,"['not usability', 'video', 'usability']","[0.45435431599617004, 0.3991871476173401, 0.14645852148532867]"
138,cheer for the info joff yeah the temperature of the milk is definitely an issue with this machine and will be interesting to see if any of the other lattissimas fair better do not know if you have tried either the creatista plus or creatista pro but the milk temperature on both of those nepsresso machine is excellent and you can control it too,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.778234601020813, 0.18624484539031982, 0.03552062064409256]"

147,that is the newer version of the one i had many year ago and it look like they have not improved on the temperature of the drink it wa the low temperature that made me return it i found the milk wa lukewarm at best i may be the odd one out here but i always use fahrenheit when measuring drink temperature so an on screen graphic when you do temperature test may be be a good addition would probably help your u viewer too thanks again for all your great review,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.6449626684188843, 0.23780512809753418, 0.11723221093416214]"

224,i have had this machine for about a week now and absolutely love it the milk frother should not stop at that point a i have used it a few time now for a cappuccino for my wife and it is used the correct amount every single time so there is probably something wrong there with the sensor or something it drip quite a bit with any drink i do but i just leave the cup underneath it for an extra 10 second to let it finish when you wa making the drink with a glass of that shape i thjnk it would of been worth moving the higher drip tray off completely but also to note the froth did seem very erratic nothing in what i have seen with mine it is a shame that you did not enjoy it a i love mine i am using mine for myself a i am the black coffee lungo and espresso drinker and the milk coffee my wife is but she mainly is a tea drinker so she would not use the machine a i would so it kinda is a perfect machine for u a i type this i see you using another sized cup yes that is annoying a i got the recipe view glass and that is the perfect size for it you should not have to do it that i know but i thought i would mention it appreciate the review anyways,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6658994555473328, 0.20784837007522583, 0.1262521892786026]"

1362,yeah being honest i would go for a separate machine and frother myself i love latte and if there is a chance of stretching to the creatista plus i would opt for that over any lattissima know they are not cheap though so would personally still go for a cheaper machine plus aeroccino 4 just so you do not have to remove the spring when you want le froth and it ha an extra froth setting when you want more would recommend watching more of the video though a will hopefully help you to decide,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8897620439529419, 0.09468798339366913, 0.015549957752227783]"

1520,it is good practice to preheat the cup you will use fill it up with tap water and place it in the microwave oven for about a minute this will make your cup hot to the touch so be careful after that you can dispense the water and then use the machine to prepare your coffee in your now hot cup this will make your coffee hotter than usual the cold cup can drop the overall temperature of the coffee when it touch the cup hence the instruction above,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8590867519378662, 0.0885205790400505, 0.05239272117614746]"

1636,tarn yes the coffee produced is hot a common issue is that people will use a room temperature cup for their espresso which will cool it down quickly to combat this you can run a coffee program with no espresso pod installed to make hot water and add it to your mug to pre heat the mug use this heated mug for your drink now this will prevent luke warm coffee,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8259623050689697, 0.11041469871997833, 0.06362298876047134]"

1651,mrjdh1111 there are a few way to do this the lungo button will run more water through a single capsule to get more coffee but you will have a slightly weaker brew the same effect would happen if you ran the espresso button twice with the same pod to get a full strength double shot it will take 2 nespresso capsule each ran through the espresso button once you could experiment with the strength of each of these method to find what you like best hope this help,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.853034496307373, 0.0852014571428299, 0.06176409497857094]"

1733,hi there my honest reply would be it depends what discount are available on other machine if you know a lattissima is what you want then it probably is but even then the lattissima touch offer more setting all be it with a smaller frother for le money i like the creatista machine myself but they might not be to everyones taste sorry the answer is not more straightforward but it is a lot to spend if it is not the right machine for you,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5127572417259216, 0.28259673714637756, 0.2046460658311844]"
1734,a great independent review a always to be honest i still can not believe this machine is still part of the current nespresso line of machine the lattissima pro wa released in early 2014 a the top end lattissima machine with the lattissima plus being the main steam offering since the the lattissima range ha undergone quite a visual change but for some reason this pro model is still the same machine that wa released in 2014 and personally i think it look rather dated the other issue i see is that it suffers with the typical lattissima problem of luke warm coffee when making a milk based drink i honestly thought this pro model had a temperature setting but after watching this video it is clear it doe not what i can not seem to understand is why nespresso have not seemed to address this luke warm coffee issue that seems inherent in the lattissima range there is no way a milk based drink would be coming out of these machine at le than 65c when prepared and should be closer to 68c 70c to be getting 59c is just not hot enough and like i have mentioned in the past i have seen old lattissima plus not getting higher that 50c but classed a within specification by nespresso i am really sorry to bang the same old drum for me it is got to be a nespresso requirement that these lattissima machine can not make a milk drink hotter a my delonghi pain in the as to use bean to cup machine with auto latte system that these nespresso machine are based on ha no issue serving milk based drink at 70c consistently it also seems like the creatista range can be up to 10c hotter on the milk drink also so i just do not understand why these lattissima machine are not able to match the 65c 68c with milk based drink of the creatista range again the review is great and are a pleasure to watch a i try to decide which new nespresso machine to buy have a great week joff,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.532342255115509, 0.2825853228569031, 0.1850724220275879]"

1738,i am trying to decide on which nespresso machine to buy i think it is going to be the citiz or the lattisima however i am not sure which one is better if i want a milk frother the lattisima or citiz with an integrated milk frother or simply the basic citiz and then buy a milk frother seperatly thank you for the great and very informative video,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8443456292152405, 0.109285369515419, 0.0463690385222435]"
1739,thanks for that glad you like the video if it help at all out of those choice i quite like the citiz and seperate aeroccino 4 milk frother a it ha an extra froth latte macchiato setting and you do not need to remove the spring if you want le froth it is also dishwasher safe though i guess you could buy whichever milk frother brand you wanted,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.8553353548049927, 0.13629187643527985, 0.008372821845114231]"

1745,hi yeah it seems to be what nespresso recommend a it is a latte macchiato the machine make rather then a latte the macchiato ha more froth than the cappuccino and think this bear out with the setting on the aeroccino 4 too it did take me by surprise when i watched the official nespresso video too a doe not seem natural to turn the froth to the lowest setting for a cappaccino doe it,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.7815236449241638, 0.19975461065769196, 0.018721753731369972]"
