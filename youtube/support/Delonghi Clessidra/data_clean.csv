0,Delonghi Clessidra Filter Brewer Review,any chance you could use a metal filter with this somehow coffee bean delivered thank you that would be great oh yeh i am pretty sure it ha both option but let me confirm coffee bean delivered oh your review ha you using a paper filter yes it actually come with a metal one from what i remember everything i hoped it would be i love the simplicity of this keurig mybest kitchen i have had the old school original keurig for forever i decided to upgrade to button lol same great quality without having to measure your water this keurig doe all the thinking for you i also love not having to put water into the machine every time i want to use it simple and perfect i bought it and the coffee is not hot when i want to drink it later after 2 hour although the switch is on all the time i am pretty sure that it only keep it warm for an hour or so i could be wrong though so just google for the manual it is on their page this might be a manufacturing error i would contact the place you bought it great review thanks for sharing thank you so the top part never get cleaned and if i want to should i do it with a rag pd great review thank you yep you can clean the water container a well just use a clean cloth is the taste comparable to doing all manual stuff with hario v60 coffee bean delivered thank you im def not skilled or barista level skill good question look to be honest if you are a skilled pour over barista you will be able to create a better taste using a v60 but if you just enjoy the taste of filter and you want the coffee made while you do something else for 5 10 minute then the clessidra is great just got this the instruction actually say to place the lid with the vent at the back so it vent the steam away from you other than that nice review ahhh that explains why i almost burnt myself thanks is the top part that hold the water plastic or glass yes from memory it is all glass i will confirm though a it is been a while since i used it but i am pretty sure it glass the carafe definitely is on delonghi is uk website price is now gbp100 i have picked a barely used one up from ebay for gbp35 ecbc certification put this machine in a league of it own great review thank you you are welcome great review thanks for mentioning the upgrade from nespresso because that is exactly what i am looking at doing just wondering if you know where to get the filter or what type of filter to use hi sorry for the really late response i hope you found some filter
1,DeLonghi Specialty Coffee Maker | Crew Review,are we supposed to pretend you did not put 9 scoop so what is the difference between this and a regular electric drip with a number 4 filter they both drip over the ground in the same manner i bet no one would be able to tell the difference between the too except maybe an experienced cupper regular electric drip coffee machine have inconsistent and lower than desired temperature when brewing these coffee machine make weak coffee i well known workaround is to pour boiling water into the coffee machine before a brew cycle this coffee machine insures that the water temperature is perfect during the entire brew cycle so if i understand this correctly the idea is that two thing are superior over a regular filter machine first is the dripping system that is way wider than on a regular machine wich simply allow the water to pas through all the coffee and not just the center of it in a slower process the second thing is having a more consistent water heat during the whole process wich play a good part on the final taste however this type of brewing can really shine only with fresh grounded coffee otherwise i think you are right the difference will not be noticeable for most of u i hope i got it correctly i got this one a couple of day ago i could not make it brew i only boiled water i tried everything i even brought the descaler liquid for it i just will not brew got soo frustrated i returned back to the store look who is back i just unloaded mine today and ca not get the water to go into the carafe your thought what water should be used is it cold water or just filtered water or just tap water it wa never mentioned in your video thanks you may be surprised if i tell you that this coffee maker extract the best flavor of coffee even better than moccamaster and ratio 6 and other expensive machine but the only drawback is the cheap plastic people at high altitude above sea level may have problem with it can you explain why it would be an issue at high altitude i am at 1000m above sea level so i am curious soo you liked it hated it worth the price i guinelly want to know if you would stop a friend of yours from buying similar in price because you seem like a no b kind of person how do you clean the upper part where the water is placed nice review well i bought one of these and for the life of me i could not get the water to go down into the coffee ground and into the coffee craft so i thought it must be defective so i bought another one and i still can not get that water to go down to the coffee ground into the coffee pot please please tell me what i am doing wrong great video bought it after watching this i can not find the original filter for sale in the u what kind of filter should i get any recommendation mate beep 3 push button do you know they make a reusable filter in place of the paper gail is a legend do you think the taste can be compared to a moccamaster grey fleece are so underrated tengo una cafetera igual pero tiene un problema que calienta pero no sale agua me podr an desir como arreglarla alguna soluci n tuve el mismo problema en la tienda probaron 2 m s y ninguna funcion is there reason it boil up top but never pours down into the craft mango mill honstein nope move to sea level dumbest thing eeeevverrr i am stuck with 2 they did give me my money back but still i just trash them brand new appliance what a shame tootsigirl broooo that is stupiddddd we just got one but we live in colorado so it will not work anyway to fix this i have the same problem tootsigirl gosh i am so disappointed seemed almost perfect my city is 7 382 ft above sea level why would they sell stuff that ai not gon na work anyway thanks for answering hi gail i have a delonghi dedica with pressurised basket in the portafilter so i wa wondering if you could give some information about which grinder is suitable to pull good espresso shot in the above pertaining appliance my second question is whether baratza virtuoso or sette 30 270 are good enough to grind to required size for best extraction looking forward to your reply regard arjun 9 scoop i wan na see these all video for hour i fucking love brewing coffee man i am one year later but me too man i am watching this drinking my cup of joe meh look good but how doe it compare to the moccamaster taste like a cup of coffee not to bad it mean there is nothing special about it it is very attractive i will give it that i would be very interested to know exactly what kind of testing procedure are in place for those sca certification do they test only new machine or do they somehow simulate several year of heavy use so that they only certify brewer that one can expect to be just a accurate after it ha been used daily for a decade or so grandpa joe exactly because they build complete dollarhit these day doubt they care about how the machine will operate down the line such is the way of our society something will work for a year and then end up in a landfill not too bad is not a glowing review i think i will pas on this one marie a m the hario v60 is more work though yeah when i heard her say that i will just stick with hario v60 i agree not to bad doe not sound to good i am still looking for a new coffee maker that wa 9 scoop probably over compensating for the braun review lol having to remove the brew basket first before pouring is a deal breaker for me very inelegant design choice carsten junge would it though they could make the glass carafe smaller because right now it need to accommodate the brew basket but splitting it into two separate piece would allow them to shrink the carafe it would get a bit taller philip ha a similar one with a boiler on top and it is so tall that it hardly fit if you have cabinet hanging on the wall above your kitchen table i agree about removing the basket before pouring to me that would be a pain in the you know where kind of cool great review gail curious to see the the pour over compared with the breville precision brewer and or the robotic pour over appliance from melitta perk etc this thing is horrible owned for a month nothing but problem it dribble all over the counter the coffee taste good but it is not worth it it horribly slow a well it a dumbed down version of the behmor actually behmor brazen plus 2 0 ha been around for a long time and water boil in the too chamber first before brewing did not wet the filter white filter tend to not really need a rinse certainly not for the purpose of this demo for best result at home sure also remember to plug in the machine i counted nine scoop one for the pot and one for a cup each should be measured by weight haha me too yep definitely nine scoop yep nine first viewer d i never get to be the first day made
