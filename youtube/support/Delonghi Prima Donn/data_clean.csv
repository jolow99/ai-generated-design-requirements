1,Delonghi PrimaDonna Soul Coffee Machine  - Better than Costa / Starbucks? (Bean to Cup Freshness),it is not hot enough is there possibiity to make a coffe from the bed without standing out form the bed i mean do i have to stand up to attach container with the milk from fridge to the primadonna coffee maker how heavy is this delonghi primadonna soul or siemens eq9 s700 which is better doe the coffee come out hot at what temperature is this available in north america did you find out thanks great video lot is of hand on a nice to have wish would be a bit better audio lapel mic when you are doing the testing i see some mention jura terrority when it come to price i will actually change my jura e8 for this the jura i got make really bitter coffe tried everything of setting cleaning and different bean it just need to add some sugar and stir just started watching when you filled tank with water do you not put the white water conditioner thing in is an ceramic grinder in this maschine do not use granulat nobody use that with a coffee machine use always roasted bean and get much higher result doe it not have option to manually heat or froth milk yes it doe got one today absolutely brilliant your demo is a great help glad to hear enjoy got one great review thx would you please tell me the difference between soul and prima donna 650 75 coz i want to buy one very good so how do you maintain amp clean it what are the consumable part can you integrate the app with alexa siri or hey google how hot is a latte luke warm or proper hot kailem jones just to let you know i just got this machine and with the coffee temperature set to max the milk drink are nice and hot it is a fantastic machine yes i would also like to know how hot the milk get previous delonghi machine the milk always come out lukewarm is the coffee is and the hot water for tea nice and hot most machine make warm but not hot doe this one make it hot the maxiumun whit water is only fo whit descaleing not for actully prepering the coffe itself after finishing this video he stayed awake for 3 day   i have one of these and they are really that good yes rich coffee taste but if you are someone who pay for a cappuccino espresso etc at a cafe on the way to work because you need that hit of java then you will pay off the investment pretty quickly i personally have 2 coffee in a travel mug each morning and with a wife and 18yo daughter and 19yo son who live at home while going to university who all drink coffee i find this machine make wonderful coffee with good quality fresh whole bean and financial sense to boot ymmv but i love very expensive the cup holder is not heated what is different between soul and 650 75 i really need the answer brilliant review so can you store bean inside the machine or no and what type of milk do you use uht so it doesnt go off yes tip a pack of bean into the hopper and the lid seal them in you can use skimmed or semi skimmed milk but you need to store the milk container in the fridge when not in use no more nescafe instant from now on got ta say i like it but not the price i could do without all the extra do they have a more stripped down version affordable you should check out the dinamica plus of delonghi seth offered for sale holy crao you seen the price of this crazy   very impressive stuff same price a the famous nuova simonelli oscar coffee machine no thanks always something new from you chigz thank you for the excellent detailed review bravo thanks una de esa yo necesito eso hace hasta cerveza jejejejeje saludos desde dominicana la bella great review good review would also have been useful to cover how easy or difficult it is to keep the machine clean the pricing on this device is pretty toppy for gbp1 200 you are into jura territory and all this smartphone malarkey is 90percent useless you just want a machine that is reliable make good coffee and is easy to keep clean i have got their previous unit which is far bigger easy a to clean just bought this one for work and i would imagine it would be the same a very similar design i have got this machine had it around 5 month now app little fiddly no need for it except customising your size of drink for different cup travel cup etc easy to keep clean tho used a couple of water filter so far and descaled once use it every day for 2 3 bean to cup agree keep a coffee machine simple focus on making good coffee would love to see a review on jura machine but would totally understand since this is a tech not coffee channel machine ha self cleaning feature it let you know on the screen when you need to press the clean button awesome review chigz great detailed review nice slurping too taste taste and taste very nice machne but expensive buuuuu wow thats a serious machine over gbp1k though rich coffee taste no pun intended by the time this ha made my coffee i will be late for work work from home dude make your coffee even after work start lol i watched because of you but i would buy something else with 1200 euro im going to the coffee shop sage barista express is much better and half the price did you ever calculate how many time you can go to the coffee shop before this machine actually becomes a much cheaper option granted it doe not match the perfect espresso and cappucinos you can get at some coffeeshops but it doe get very close indeed thanks for watching look awsome although you can not beat going to a coffee shop thanks chigz gbp1200 lol my tassimo is quicker than this and make great coffee at a fraction of the price gbp30 50 tassimo coffee is rubbish pod machine are like printer they are cheap to buy but the pod ink cartridge is where they make their money plus you are stuck with the limited range of cartridge available for your machine i have a tassimo too but this machine is on another level you can taste the difference in freshness bean to cup is basically like having costa at home if you drink a lot of coffee like myself then the tassimo pod can add up thanks for watching mate nice but i want to go out to the coffee shop you and me both but this machine still rock
