52,hey bw thanks for the question for best espresso flavor we always suggest setting super automatic machine grinder to their finest setting if the finest setting should cause the machine not to brew you can always set it a little coarser but not brewing at finest setting is rare when adjusting to a finer grind setting the grinder should be running when making the adjustment that is not possible on all machine a some have safety mechanism which prevent the grinder from operating whne been hopper door are open if that is the case for you only adjust 1 click in between each grinding can not compare flow rate of super auto machine to those of semi auto machine the brewing chamber in super auto is much different in geometry than the filter basket of semi auto machine beyond that coffee dos tend to be a lot smaller hope that help,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6282272338867188, 0.2376105934381485, 0.13416217267513275]"

133,hi sophie to adjust temperature press the gear icon to enter the setting menu scroll to general then set temperature from there you can select low medium high or maximum with the arrow key then press ok to save it i do not believe there is a way to turn off the rinse cycle a it is designed to keep everything clean but it should only perform it automatically when the machine is turned on or off i generally keep a cup nearby and rinse into that so i do not have to empty the drip trap a often aj,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6662516593933105, 0.17750553786754608, 0.1562427282333374]"

135,the milk coming out of the lattecrema system is on par with other superautomatics i have not specifically measured the temp but i would guess around 140 150f it is not a hot a the coffee coming out but you also do not want it to be hotter than that and milk start to lose it sweetness and degrade in taste at this point we do not carry the delonghi primadonna elite aj,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6903405785560608, 0.19123491644859314, 0.11842450499534607]"

146,there are some delonghi machine that you can program to turn on like before you wake up so you do not need to wait to warm up to get your first cup of coffee in the morning i can not seem to find if this one doe that and if not do you know if the dinamica plus doe or which other model doe also is it long to warm up and get that first cup of coffee,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6013437509536743, 0.2861557900905609, 0.11250044405460358]"

149,hi rodrigo thanks for the comment unfortunately there is no way to manually froth on this model if you want the option of both a carafe and manual frothing you will have to look at the gaggia accademia or babila if you just want manual frothing that open up other option like the previous dinamica model or gaggia cadorna barista plus aj,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.71185702085495, 0.2541689872741699, 0.033974044024944305]"

152,hi jbp i do not have an exact temperature but i found it on par with most other superautomatic machine milk is sweet spot is around 140f 60c any hotter than that and you start to burn the milk and lose sweetness if you want a hotter drink you can pre warm your cup and or increase your brewing temperature getting a machine with a manual frothing wand also allows you to better control milk temperature when you change aroma you are adjusting the dose quantity of ground bean aj,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7712822556495667, 0.12908099591732025, 0.09963677078485489]"
153,i have this cofee machine it is awesome nice adjustable foam definitely visible change of how strong the coffee will be for the different type of coffee a lot of adjustment for each taste simple cleaning you can take out brew unit and reach almost all place for cleaning instead of grinder i recommend a dinamica plus where you have touch screen and app for remote management via bluetooth two con you can not skip cleaning process on each wake up even when you use app so you have to change cup before you start doing cofee and second you can not change how many shot of coffee you want,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.837321400642395, 0.09894690662622452, 0.06373171508312225]"

155,lot of love expressed here for the gaggia cadorna prestige which wa not on my short list but is now biggest concern is the maximum dose size of 10 5 gram coming from a delonghi model with a maximum dose of 16 gram and i always use the maximum dose will i find the espresso from the cadorna too weak for my taste anyone former delonghi owner our there who have made the switch to gaggia any thought,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7550448179244995, 0.16045165061950684, 0.08450350165367126]"
156,i guess that make perfect sense i like to do 2 max shot 2 x16 gram with with a 2 x 2 oz 60ml pour so i end up with a 4oz 120ml of espresso from 32 gram of coffee with the gaggia it would be 1 x double shot for 23 gram on 2oz of water 1 x a single shot at say 10grams on 2oz of water for a total of 33grams in 4oz of espresso so same thing in the end of course with the dinamica you can also do a double shot and program the water so it would be the same outcome with one press of the button instead of two but i am not that lazy if the result are better also like the fact that the milk come out hotter on the gaggia mark is review said it wa around 155 degree v 140 for the delonhi i steam my own now and it always in the 150 160 range also like your suggestion below that the iced feature on the delonghi is really not much different then running an extra strong shot of espresso at low brew temp which sound like a good work around hey one more question any idea if the gaggia doe well with non dairy milk the delonghi sell this point on the lattecrema system specifically in it promotional material i use almond milk to avoid dairy allergy almond milk if you find the right brand work amazingly well for manual frothing at least now last question promise it is a fairly big jump in price from the dinamica to the cadorna is the coffee that much better to justify it,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.5949589014053345, 0.2507826089859009, 0.15425844490528107]"
157,hi claudia if you find that to be the case you can brew double shot on the cadorna prestige and it will grind tamp brew two full cycle if you set the volume to the minimum and the strength to the maximum you will end up using 23g coffee for 2 total ounce which is a higher dose than is generally used by professional baristas using commercial equipment hope this help aj,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8762013912200928, 0.07929237931966782, 0.04450623318552971]"

191,i am not sure about the dinamica plus or if when we will be carrying it i will say the dinamica with lattecrema is much more user friendly than the previous dinamica model without the screen on that one i had to refer to the menu a lot but not on the lattecrema model a for the dinamica v cadorna cleaning the carafe is not much harder on one v the other there is a dial on the dinamica carafe that rinse the tube and an equivalent quick clean feature in the cadorna menu this is recommended on each machine after making a milk drink daily take about 15 second and doe not require emptying the carafe it is recommended to also disassemble and wash the carafe part on both weekly the gaggia also ha a deep clean menu option which involves putting cleaning product in the carafe and more thoroughly clean the milk system monthly it is not a troublesome a it sound but old milk can be gross so it is definitely better to keep up with it each machine ha it advantage such a iced coffee on the delonghi and one touch americanos on the gaggia they are both solid choice but for my personal us and user interface i prefer the cadorna prestige aj,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7878727316856384, 0.15398067235946655, 0.05814659968018532]"

207,hey paul i have personally never used the dinamica plus but it look like it add the touchscreen and app control a you mentioned a well a the option to brew a full pot of coffee it also seems they removed the iced coffee feature so something to consider if you want that option other than those different drink everything else should be the same internally and drink quality will be identical look like there is about a dollar500 difference so it all depends how much you value those luxury feature personally if i wa going to get into that price bracket i would probably look at the jura ena 8 aj,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6890205144882202, 0.1668703258037567, 0.14410912990570068]"

257,hi chris thanks for the question most every super automatic machine will do a rinse when turned on and turned off it is part of keeping the machine clean rinse the coffee delivery circuit and put fresh water into the thermoblock boiler prior to use machine can be left on but most do shut off eco mode after a user defined amount of time the cadorna for instance will shut off automatically up to 3 hour after turn on i should mention there is no real advantage to leaving a machine on continuously even if you could most all are ready to brew in well under a minute from turn on the cadorna doe do the rinse in my opinion it is a more capable machine than the delonghi the cadorna prestige is our daily driver in the studio we have had a bunch of different machine a daily driver and the cadorna is our favorite,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7256858944892883, 0.17580315470695496, 0.09851104021072388]"

281,hey sebastiano the dinamica ha two option one they call coffee which is essentially a much longer pull through the ground a shown in the video the other is called long which will likely be closer to what you are looking for for this they use a pulse brewing method at a lower pressure to simulate drip filter coffee it will also pause in the middle to grind a second time this preparation take longer but doe a pretty good job at creating something closer to filter coffee aj,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.9063541889190674, 0.08438105136156082, 0.009264754131436348]"

535,i just bought the delonghi dinamica and there are a couple of improvement since this review 1 there are now baffle in the drip tray 2 there is now a float that rise to let you know when to empty the drip tray the price difference mentioned in the review is currently dollar150 with the delonghi being the more expensive machine also water temperature can be adjusted there is a video on how to do it here on youtube the temperature is set based on water hardness and they provide a test strip with the machine it is a very nice machine and i am satisfied with the purchase the deciding factor for me wa the puck the machine make the delonghi make a perfect puck while the phillips review i saw showed that the puck wa like mud i have owned machine in the past where you put dairy in a second reservoir and the machine will take care of making the cream perfect too but i have found that moving the dairy in and out of the fridge and cleaning it is more effort than using the built in frother,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.48533961176872253, 0.38842761516571045, 0.1262328177690506]"

587,thats not that dumb of a question this machine compress and steam the ground to extract flavour generally it would be rather difficult to get enough tea in there for it to properly compress without it becoming overly bitter but the larger problem would be that tea is not really supposed to be boiled and so the steam would make the tea rather bitter not to mention the fact that this method would not give the water enough time to make a decent tea but yeah if you want easy delicious ice tea do a cold brew tea recipe,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6963713765144348, 0.21476715803146362, 0.08886148780584335]"

830,ah good question milk temperature is the trade off you will get for having a fully automated milk system automated frothers only come into momentary contact with the steam so the milk temperature is intrinsically lower than if you were steaming with a wand it is absolutely not luke warm that is an exaggeration some people make about automatic system however it is noticeable especially if you are not adding hot coffee to it and only having the milk by itself if you are getting a fully automatic system i would consider warming the cup prior to use the biggest temperature drop happens when the milk coffee hit the glass hope this help liam,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.46235910058021545, 0.4273741841316223, 0.11026674509048462]"

835,greggiexplore thanks for sharing your experience from my year of using espresso machine i have a few thought and recommendation espresso strength is largely defined grind size which must be done via the dial in the back of the machine and is not handled by the machine automatically drastically different result will occur with a couple notch on the grind adjustment dial this is called the wouldialling in process i would recommend a google search and should be done quickly when initializing the machine or changing coffee bean to taste for stronger espresso shot you will need to increase the finest of the grind the machine can pull shot in any strength you want to set it to best result will come from a medium dark roast coffee some medium to light roast will be harder to work with and will not extract a nicely i would recommend starting off with lavazza gran espresso or super crema these will yield great result easily hope these note help you on your espresso journey and for your next machine liam,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7778413891792297, 0.1258617490530014, 0.09629688411951065]"

838,very good question the eletta cappuccino top is my personal favourite between the two the eletta seems to be capable of reaching a finer grind size for stronger espresso shot this is especially useful for milk based drink or straight espresso the eletta cappuccino top also ha two frothing system manual and automatic for optionally hotter milk with a better micro foam texture all the dinamica machine have better tasting long coffee and also have a well executed unique iced coffee function the new dinamica plus is also undoubtably better user experience it ha better programability for user presets and advanced milk drink customization in the end it is up to personal preference and where your priority are liam,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7466177940368652, 0.14526453614234924, 0.1081177219748497]"
