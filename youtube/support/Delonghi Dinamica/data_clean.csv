0,Review: DeLonghi Dinamica With LatteCrema Automatic Espresso Machine,is there an option to buy a second milk carafe we are a two type of milk household soy and oat it would be so convenient to have two carafe to change out hello great idea unfortunately we do not sell separate carafe for the dinamica you should be able to get one directly from delonghi if you contact them aj came here from james hoffman comparison vid nice thanks for watching aj hello there i just bought a new ecam 350 55 b wa browsing through the internet for some video on the usage and diff drink that we can make with this machine want to know more on how can make americano and a flat white can you pls send me a link of any video that you have already made on americano and flat white made with dinamica ecam 350 55 b if not if you can please let me know thanks a lot rajesh new to your channel just subscribed today hi rajesh welcome and thanks for subscribing there is no one touch americano function on the ecam 350 55 b you would have to prepare an americano in two step first brew a shot of espresso into your cup then move your cup over and with the hot water attachment inserted dispense hot water into the cup on top of the espresso i believe that model ha a build in flat white preset if you go into the drink menu i recomment turning the froth dial down to the minimum froth when preparing a flat white aj your not supposed to adjust the grinder when the grinder is idle teaching is the wrong way plus the grind doe not kick in for at least 2 cup of coffee how doe the my coffee setting get saved for the next time hi fay it is generally okay to adjust courser without the grinder running you are correct that it should be running while going finer a there are some ground stuck between the burr that will make it harder to bring them closer together and could cause damage there are option in the setting menu for prg beverage and prg my beverage that allow you to program setting for each drink and save them for future preparation here is a video from delonghi on the process aj which model number is this unit whole latte love thanks this video show model ecam35075si i am currently working on a new video showing the dinamica plus model ecam37095ti aj how do you change the heat setting press the setting button the icon with the gear general temperature then select low medium high or maximum aj hi i have a delonghi primadona with position did you use on the grounding for the the coffe yes position 1 aj whole latte love hi again so you used the position 1 right hi pedro i generally use the finest grind position for espresso drink on super automatic machine the only time i would change that is if it is choking the machine coffee is slowly dripping out or not coming out at all or sometimes if i am preparing a long coffee aj i brough this machine love the coffee i make mostly latte and i find the milk to be luke warm how to realy get hot milk from the machine rather than having to heat it again pre heating your cup with hot water will go a long way to making your overall drink hotter also using the hottest brewing temperature aj how can have very strong coffee in this machine hi el set your grind to fine with strength and temperature set to max then make volume of drink appropriate double up brew cycle with lower volume to make a single larger drink if needed  hi i hope you are still answering question i currently have a semi auto single boiler espresso machine and separate grinder vario 886 i primarily drink long black but when i want regular coffee i use the pour over or french press my favorite method anyway now that you know a little about me i am looking at this machine because i am over chasing that elusive at least for me perfect espresso i am tired of wasting expensive coffee having to dial in the grinder i am over 70 and have arthritic hand thus no hand grinder for me again every time i change bean or brew method also i noticed this machine doe cold brew which is really not true cold brew but is iced coffee on the fly which is what i drink almost exclusively in the summer so would you recommend this machine for me whole latte love hi aj thanks for getting back to me a quick follow up question for you can i use the dinamica without the lattecrema attachment i do not make lot of milk drink doe it have a separate manual steam wand thanks again hi george thanks for the comment and context a superauto like the dinamica will certainly make your life easier no dialing in or wasting coffee and le repetitive use strain on the body that said it is a little harder to experiment and tweak taste to your particular preference many many people love the espresso out of super auto but some who come from a semi auto background find them limiting if that is a trade off you are willing to make then it would be a great option aj i usually add sugar to the cold milk before steaming la spaziale a it creates a uniform sweetness can you add sugar to the milk in this system without fouling clogging the foaming system agree hi s not something we have tried and i am guessing manufacturer would recommend against adding sugar to the milk think the worst that could happen is the frothing component might need some extra cleaning may i know what is the best volume and aroma setting for each drink to get the best flavour of the bean how to know from the cup of espresso to see whether the machine extract perfect espresso a i do not know how to taste the perfect espresso able to get video on de longhi dinamica plus review hi bryant taste will be completely subjective the perfect espresso for you will not be the perfect espresso for someone else in general though you are looking for a complimentary balance of sweetness bitterness and acidity some people prefer eathy nutty chocolatey flavor profile while others prefer light and fruity one regardless of your bean or preference a good place to start on super automatic machine is a 2oz 60ml shot of espresso using the finest grind highest strength aroma and hottest temperature and adjust from there based on taste aj i want this here is a link to purchase this machine currently out of stock but it should be back soon aj i bought one today in australia and it doe not have a many button on the central panel old model at dollar1200 or different manufacturing feeling ripped off thanks delonghi could be the older model perhaps the ecam35020 did it look like the machine compare in this video aj god i wish i could see the inside and how it work while this type of machine generally is not meant to be taken apart this animation will give you a good idea of how everything work on the inside aj hi how i can get a hot milk or steam from dinamica pluse hi tamer the dinamica plus ha an option for hot milk on the touch screen display no dedicated steam feature since there is no steam wand the steam is integrated into the carafe for frothing one touch milk drink aj do you know what the coffee dose range is for the dinamica like 5 10g of ground per shot hi bc that range is about right how do u determine how may gram of coffee is grinded in each coarse setting delonghi doe not publicize that info i support if you wanted to measure you could empty your dreg drawer start a drink cancel it after grinding but before water hit the puck then weight the dry ground that get dumped into the drawer aj just found you guy while learning about automatic espresso machine you guy have the best review out there excellent work and content welcome aboard how many cup per day hi sue well it can make them a fast and a many a you like but do understand it is a machine designed for home use and not commercial 10 a day no problem and it can do a lot more nice informative video used to have coffee day machine in my dental clinic now added this machine thanks thank you aj hi this is a great video could you make the macchiati also what is the difference between them thanks doe it work with alexa and google no hi i am a newbie on super automatic machine which i do not know anything about coffee machine i would like to have advise on how to use the delonghi dinamica machine which i had just bought a per check the grind size is around 5 i would like to make an espresso which is the same taste a i am having when going to starbucks a per check the flow is quite fast could you advise what is the best grinding setting recommend on this machine and do i need to turn to turn to 7 first and turn to 1 per click need to adjust while grinding how to know is this machine had extract the best espresso whole latte love what about temperature setting for this machine set to medium or low so you would recommend to set at the finest setting do i need to tune back to the most course setting and change to the finest hey bw thanks for the question for best espresso flavor we always suggest setting super automatic machine grinder to their finest setting if the finest setting should cause the machine not to brew you can always set it a little coarser but not brewing at finest setting is rare when adjusting to a finer grind setting the grinder should be running when making the adjustment that is not possible on all machine a some have safety mechanism which prevent the grinder from operating whne been hopper door are open if that is the case for you only adjust 1 click in between each grinding can not compare flow rate of super auto machine to those of semi auto machine the brewing chamber in super auto is much different in geometry than the filter basket of semi auto machine beyond that coffee dos tend to be a lot smaller hope that help ok so how hot doe the milk get because i like my milk to be really hot when i drink my coffee hey bb29 thanks for the question if you like the milk really hot you will likely be disappointed with a super automatic machine from any manufacturer all produce frothed milk temp in the sweet zone from 125 150f same a a well trained barista there are a few automatic machine which have manual steam wand a little more work for the user but you can froth to any temperature you like and you can froth to latte art quality on those if interested here are 2 machine with manual frothing wand gaggia magenta plus gaggia cadorna barista plus great review doe this one have wifi for siri thank you no wifi on this but the updated dinamica plus model can use bluetooth connected to an app not sure about siri capability though aj what will happen if the knob on the milk tank is set to the latte function and we press cappuccino button hi mp you will get a finer milk froth instead of an airier cappuccino style froth do you have a comparison for delonghi dinamica v gaggia anima prestige one touch coffee machine whole latte love thanks for your reply my coffee machine broke down yesterday i am looking at the following de longhi dinamica fully automatic coffee machine gaggia magenta milk automatic coffee machine gaggia anima prestige one touch cappuccino coffee machine i would love your opinion review on the three i only found review on the de longhi and the anima but could not find anything on the magenta thanks for your help hi k will see if we can do that for now if you have not watched here is our video on the anima prestige marc delonghi dinamica ecam v gaggia anima prestige one touch coffee machine sorry updated the dolonghi is there any reason to get the dollar2 000 plus system over this hi mathew if it ha feature you are looking for thank you so much for a detailed review i really like the way you did the review and the process of it all you are so welcome thanks for the vid aj i am torn between this machine and the jura ena 8 which do you think is better hey iamlordhk it depends i prefer the look user interface and brewing technology p e p on the ena 8 but the milk system on the dinamica the jura ha smaller capacity and le pre programmed drink option than the delonghi but i live in a small household and it feature all of our favorite so those thing do not bother me much all come down to your usage and preference aj i would like to get one but it look annoying you have to keep changing the grinding size and i would like to have the option to connect a hose like in the fridge to refill the water reservoir also it will be nice to have an alarm when the coffee disposal container is full whole latte love thanks for the information i will get one hey jalr every super automatic will alert you when it is time to empty the used coffee container there are no machine available with automatic water refill option year ago there were a few but no longer a to grind size when using these machine i typically set to the finest grind setting and leave it there that fine size is what you want when making espresso for larger coffee i prefer machine which make americanos if not familiar it is an espresso with plain hot water added over the top making larger coffee that way eliminates the need to change grind size when changing drink type my brother just bought this machine and i have no idea how to use it do not want to break it either hi natalya i would not worry too much about breaking it they are pretty rugged machine avoid using oily or flavored bean and give the instruction manual a quick look do you have any specific question that i can answer to help out aj re the iced coffee mode why would this machine or for that reason any machine alter the temperature of brewing to prioritise amelting the ice instead of keeping the optimal brewing temperature when we brew espresso we understand that lower brewing temperature lt 92 degree yield a thinner body sweetness and bitterness but higher acidity profile i am interested on your thought on why delonghi would introduce this whole latte love like me i almost always drink medium to dark roast high arabica content blend and stay away from light roast that have too much citrus and that require high brew temperature so although it is not true cold brew which by the way is not really cold brew but is typically room temperature brewed it is what is considered iced coffee and the lower brewing temperature go well with darker roast and coarser grind size hey ryan i get what you are saying and i do not disagree for me that mindset applies more to semi automatic machine where brewing temp grind size brew ratio can all be finely dialed in to achieve the best tasting espresso possible most superauto user are seeking convenience and a good drink without having to worry too much about tinkering with variable in short will the iced coffee feature brew at the optimal temperature probably not is it designed to brew an iced coffee that doe not just turn into a cold watered down coffee yes it is a feature that some people love whether they simply like iced coffee or the lower brewing temperature work well with their bean and taste preference there are others who will never use it and prefer the other drink option on the machine to each their own aj just purchased this machine thanks for the video i have been using a filter drip i like a half cup at a time so it stay hot not a small a espresso not a full cup without going high test on caffeine what is the best way to do that thanks in advance hi pauline it sound like the lungo would be perfect for you located in your drink menu for this machine is purpose it is kind of in the middle between a espresso and a cup of coffee you can program the strength aroma lower if you want le caffeine aj do you have to buy any filter cartridge for it and you forgot to show where the water go in hi warren i showed where the water go in 3 48 the machine come with a filter and replacement are available here aj i bought this machine and have a problem all of the milk drink come out lukewarm at best i went into setting and moved the temperature of the coffee drink to max but can not find any setting for milk temperature help hi lynn there are no adjustment for milk temp super automatic machine all produce milk temp in the sweet range which run from 125 150f 52 66c those are the same temp a well trained barista froth milk to for best flavor this may seem cool to those who have been served poorly made milk drink milk frothed too hot a well made latte should be at a temp which allows for quick drinking for hotter milk make sure the frothing component are clean internally milk residue can cause lower milk temp pre heating cup help the beverage stay warmer milk temp in the carafe before froth is made play a roll if super cold froth output will be cooler also try adjusting the froth dial you will get a hotter froth in an airy froth hope that help marc amazon review include comment that the milk frothing system doe not get the milk hot enough and it can not be adjusted to a high enough temp any suggestion for overcoming this or correction to this ding on what otherwise seems like a great machine some reviewer said they heated their milk in the microwave before using it hi barbara i found the milk from the dinamica on par with most other superautomatic machine and i consider it an appropriate temperature some people prefer their milk hotter but milk is sweet spot is around 140f 60c any hotter than that and you start to burn the milk and lose sweetness if you want a hotter drink you can pre warm your cup and or increase your brewing temperature for the espresso getting a machine with a manual frothing wand also allows you to better control milk temperature if you want it hotter aj i tried using the ground coffee option but it tasted watery any suggestion whole latte love thank you kindly for the response i will give your suggestion a shot hey happy cat happy life nice username it could be a couple thing my first guess would be the freshness of the coffee you are using preground loses it is freshness much faster than whole bean ground coffee that is been sitting on the shelf in a grocery store will always taste weaker than fresh ground are you using the pre ground doser so you can brew decaf that is a common use and i often find decaf coffee to have suboptimal taste too make sure you are using a full scoop of the ground coffee but not more you could also try increasing your water temperature which will increase extraction hope this help aj question about the material the hot liquid are exposed to are they stainless steel or is it mostly plastic tubing etc if plastic are you aware of any similar machine which use stainless for material contacting the hot liquid hi rus i am not aware of any super automatic machine which do not have some plastic in the hot liquid path to the cup sorry can you explain what the difference is between the dinamica plus and the dinamica lacremma also you mentioned you prefer the gaggia prestige cardona over this machine can you explain why im comparing both hi whole latte love would you recommend this machine delonghi dinamica or the gaggia magenta prestige thank you for your advice hi lynn i have not gotten my hand on the dinamica plus yet but it look like that model add a nicer color touch screen display more drink option such a a full pot of coffee and app control to customize drink from your smartphone it appears that some model of the plus may have also gotten rid of the iced coffee option while others have it we are expecting the have the dinamica plus in stock in august or september and will be doing a full review video of it at that point until the new one come i personally give a slight edge to the cadorna prestige i enjoy the user profile one touch americanos proper double shot flat white and xl milk drink to go the dinamica is a solid machine but for me the cadorna ha all of the same feature and more aj hello i have just bought dinamica 350 55 when i make a coffee it will only give a little quantity to drink i love drinking coffee in a mug so i want more coffee in it how can i increase the volume of coffee for a mug size thanks whole latte love thanks i will have a look hi jpa here is a link to the dinamica manual procedure for programming drink size is detailed on page 15 section 12 is it possible to purchase a frothing wand for this machine whole latte love ok thanks i think the eletta top doe it a well but i like the iced coffee feature of the dinamica hi steve thanks for the question it is not here are 2 similar automatic machine which come with a commercial style frothing wand gaggia cadorna barista plus gaggia magenta plus video of the machine available at the link hope that help marc is the gaggia anima prestige in the same class a the delonghi dinamica lattecrema whole latte love thank you very much hi brandon the dinamica with lattecrema is considered a step up from the anima prestige the delonghi ha more drink option and customizability a more comparable gaggia machine is the magenta prestige aj thanks for the review you missed showing the puck hey top cat thanks wa there something specifically you wanted to see with the puck aj can you use nut milk such a almond milk in this machine hey ali yes according to delonghi you should only use cow is milk soy rice or almond aj hi i appreciate all of your video i am debating between this machine and the gaggia anima prestige espresso machine iced coffee is not a must have for me the front loading of milk water and coffee bean drew me to this machine v top loading i do make milk coffee drink so this is key for me which product do you think is best overall thank you in advance hey jburgand they are both good machine both feature the separate milk carafe quick clean capability and a number of other similarity the dinamica will give you more capacity in your bean hopper and more grind setting one of the biggest difference is in the number of programmed drink specialty the dinamica come with 18 while the anima only ha 6 that said you will pay for those extra feature a the dinamica with lattecrema is currently dollar400 more than the anima prestige come down to personal preference but if it is in your budget i like the versatility of the dinamica aj hello is it possible to set a standard coffee with milk not whipped at the coffee machine and at the same time set the amount of milk hi zm thanks for the question yes one can control program the amount of milk delivered the dial on the milk carafe allows one to adjust between frothed milk and milk that just heated without adding air ok nice review the machine look good and i am almost sold i wa curious to see how the cleaning of the brewing group go on my older philip 3200 series that wa a problem for me hence the need to shop for another machine thanks for providing the link to manual although i see the instruction on how to clean brew group i do not see any diagram do you have a youtube video or recommend one to properly clean this i want to assure i am caring for it properly since it wa dollardollardollar hey i am curious what problem did you have with your 3200 i have been debating the delonghi or the philip 3200 hi paul the brew group should be removed from the machine at least once per month soak in water for 5 minute then rinse with tap water use no detergent when cleaning for more detail see page 16 of the manual section 17 9 cleaning the infuser we just bought this machine after our first de longhi magnifica broke down after 12 year your video wa very helpful thanks for this great video one question how do you flush hot water through the coffee spout to clean it after it ha made coffee thanks hi d happy to help i bought a maschine one month ago i descaled it four day ago and today got a message that it need to be descaled again what is the problem hi mg are you sure the machine totally completed the descaling cycle when you ran it if the descaling wa interrupted or not completed the machine will alert to descale again if you are certain the machine wa descaled completely i would run through the descaling cycle again without adding the descaling product thanks for your great demonestration i have a quetion what is the difference between this machine and delongi eletta hi somayah there is not a ton of difference between the two both have the lattecrema milk system and led display the eletta win on build quality with metal component instead of being all plastic and also ha higher capacity in the bean hopper and water reservoir dinamica ha more drink option and is a newer model plus the option of iced coffee aj we bought this machine a few week ago it our first machine and we absolutely love it awesome great to hear you are loving it aj best purchase ever i wa not a coffee drinker until after i bought this my favorite is the flat white and latte macchiato i either sprinkle some sugar on top or add some sugar free syrup before brewing easy clean up so happy with this product glad you are loving the machine thanks for sharing your experience aj hows it compared to phillips 3200lattego thanks i have never personally used the philip 3200 lattego but at a quick glance it look like it ha le grind setting le drink presets no iced coffee a little cheaper but also le function filled aj when is the dinamica plus going to be available in the u thanks hey melanie we are expecting to get it in august or september aj we just bought this system and love it so far thank you for making this thorough review i have a question and it may be controversial ha but i like having flavored latte amp iced coffee how and or where would i put my flavored syrup for these drink i have tried looking it up and could not find any information thank you i add mine before brewing hey alyssa glad to hear you are loving it nothing wrong with flavored drink if that is your thing i would add the syrup to your cup separately either before or after brewing try it both way and see which you like more aj thanks to your great review we bought this machine yesterday in the video you mention temperature control i am finding the coffee lukewarm at best could you tell me how to change that i can not seem to find a setting secondly my machine seems to rinse before and after every coffee how do i stop this thanks in advance hi sophie to adjust temperature press the gear icon to enter the setting menu scroll to general then set temperature from there you can select low medium high or maximum with the arrow key then press ok to save it i do not believe there is a way to turn off the rinse cycle a it is designed to keep everything clean but it should only perform it automatically when the machine is turned on or off i generally keep a cup nearby and rinse into that so i do not have to empty the drip trap a often aj hi how hot the milk drink from the lattecrema system is it a hot a the coffee that you have considered to be too hot or is it lukewarm drink especially the latte and cappuccino would you do a review on the delonghi primadonna elite experience i am looking to buy that model amp it us the same lattecrema system and some people say it is not hot the milk coming out of the lattecrema system is on par with other superautomatics i have not specifically measured the temp but i would guess around 140 150f it is not a hot a the coffee coming out but you also do not want it to be hotter than that and milk start to lose it sweetness and degrade in taste at this point we do not carry the delonghi primadonna elite aj hey is it possible or what is the best way to make hot chocolate in it hi linda i would make plain milk froth and add chocolate could add before or after frothing then stir to mix best not to add chocolate withing the milk carafe prior to frothing can make hot coffee phillips 4300 or delonghi dinamica without coldbrew coffee i f price were the same e shop seller condemn lattego why is it right for delonghi is lattecrema system to make a error hi saleh make coffee at temperature similar to other super automatic machine at same price i would go delonghi great video and review thanks so much i am definitely getting this machine hi sean thanks for the comment dee nah mee ca k which is better this or the gaggia cadorna hi elena both solid machine and it depends on your usage i personally prefer the cadorna prestige aj there are some delonghi machine that you can program to turn on like before you wake up so you do not need to wait to warm up to get your first cup of coffee in the morning i can not seem to find if this one doe that and if not do you know if the dinamica plus doe or which other model doe also is it long to warm up and get that first cup of coffee hey denisqcrs this model can not be programmed to turn on at a set time and i do not believe the dinamica plus can either luckily unlike most semi automatic machine the super automatic one like this are very quick to heat up generally only a minute or two until it is brew ready aj wow that look awesome tks for sharing this review wll i am struggling though to understand one thing if i want to make a manual milk foam like using the steam a the older version can i do it simply taking out the milk container and maybe putting a kind of accessory where the hot water go off thanks hi rodrigo thanks for the comment unfortunately there is no way to manually froth on this model if you want the option of both a carafe and manual frothing you will have to look at the gaggia accademia or babila if you just want manual frothing that open up other option like the previous dinamica model or gaggia cadorna barista plus aj thanks for this video i have two question the first one is what is the milk temperature for the hot milk option my second question is about the aroma setting when increasing the aroma what the machine is doing is it increasing the quantity of bean or increasing the infusion time or both thanks whole latte love how much gram of coffee is used in the default setting hi jbp i do not have an exact temperature but i found it on par with most other superautomatic machine milk is sweet spot is around 140f 60c any hotter than that and you start to burn the milk and lose sweetness if you want a hotter drink you can pre warm your cup and or increase your brewing temperature getting a machine with a manual frothing wand also allows you to better control milk temperature when you change aroma you are adjusting the dose quantity of ground bean aj i have this cofee machine it is awesome nice adjustable foam definitely visible change of how strong the coffee will be for the different type of coffee a lot of adjustment for each taste simple cleaning you can take out brew unit and reach almost all place for cleaning instead of grinder i recommend a dinamica plus where you have touch screen and app for remote management via bluetooth two con you can not skip cleaning process on each wake up even when you use app so you have to change cup before you start doing cofee and second you can not change how many shot of coffee you want hey turek thanks for sharing your experience glad you are happy with your dinamica aj lot of love expressed here for the gaggia cadorna prestige which wa not on my short list but is now biggest concern is the maximum dose size of 10 5 gram coming from a delonghi model with a maximum dose of 16 gram and i always use the maximum dose will i find the espresso from the cadorna too weak for my taste anyone former delonghi owner our there who have made the switch to gaggia any thought i guess that make perfect sense i like to do 2 max shot 2 x16 gram with with a 2 x 2 oz 60ml pour so i end up with a 4oz 120ml of espresso from 32 gram of coffee with the gaggia it would be 1 x double shot for 23 gram on 2oz of water 1 x a single shot at say 10grams on 2oz of water for a total of 33grams in 4oz of espresso so same thing in the end of course with the dinamica you can also do a double shot and program the water so it would be the same outcome with one press of the button instead of two but i am not that lazy if the result are better also like the fact that the milk come out hotter on the gaggia mark is review said it wa around 155 degree v 140 for the delonhi i steam my own now and it always in the 150 160 range also like your suggestion below that the iced feature on the delonghi is really not much different then running an extra strong shot of espresso at low brew temp which sound like a good work around hey one more question any idea if the gaggia doe well with non dairy milk the delonghi sell this point on the lattecrema system specifically in it promotional material i use almond milk to avoid dairy allergy almond milk if you find the right brand work amazingly well for manual frothing at least now last question promise it is a fairly big jump in price from the dinamica to the cadorna is the coffee that much better to justify it hi claudia if you find that to be the case you can brew double shot on the cadorna prestige and it will grind tamp brew two full cycle if you set the volume to the minimum and the strength to the maximum you will end up using 23g coffee for 2 total ounce which is a higher dose than is generally used by professional baristas using commercial equipment hope this help aj the video wa very interesting i enjoy espresso every day with delonghi is magnifica s i also subscribed to the channel please come visit me on my channel with love from japan hi great review i wa debating between this machine and the delongi eletta top ecam45760 you guy also did a review for that machine that wa very positive i am curious the eletta is the more expensive machine but aside from the ability to manually froth the dinamica appears to have the same build spec with more customization option and the ability to make iced coffee is the eletta a technically superior machine based on cost any recommendation thanks aj that is very helpful advice hi claudia not a ton of difference between the two both have the lattecrema milk system and led display the eletta win on build quality with metal component instead of being all plastic dinamica ha more drink option and is a newer model plus the iced coffee a you mentioned imo the step up to the eletta probably is not worth the price difference unless you want the metal accent aj i have a question about the grind setting on the machine the higher the number the more finer the grind is that correct hi alec thanks for the question higher number is coarser lower finer indicated by the bean graphic on the adjustment bigger bean near higher number indicate coarser grind marc am i missing something my booklet list drink like the doppio but i do not see these in the menu of drink on the machine also have seen the plus version on the international site which a color screen and ability to program 4 different user preference any idea if this will come to u thank you are you sure it is the same model drink may vary between different dinamica version the model number on this is ecam35075si a for the dinamica plus that one get rid of the the iced coffee feature but add a touch screen coffee pot option app control and user profile drink quality should be identical the extra feature will come at a higher price a far a i know no plan for u to carry that right now though that may change in the future if you are looking for something comparable that we do have check out the gaggia cadorna prestige here is a full video review of that one aj hi thank you for the video it is great and help me to get familiar with the machine i have just bought 350 55 and i have a doubt i drink espresso with a little bit of hot milk i see you can get espresso automatically caffe late automatically but how to prepare only espresso and beside that a little bit of hot milk with foam i would like to add foamy milk manually in espresso thnx hi josip sorry for the late reply somehow this comment slipped past me this machine give you espresso and hot milk a separate standalone option you can choose to do each individually if you want to change the dial on your carafe to adjust froth amount on the milk aj my coffee hii how many cup a day can this make at maximum hi aa usually when someone asks that question they are considering for commercial use be aware this is not a commercial grade machine it is intended for home office use that said it cam n make drink a fast a you can push the button plus time it take machine to make the drink my machine is only a month old and message appeared on screen that it need to be descaled so i did all that and now my milk frotter giving out hot water instead of milk i do not know how to fix that hi md most common cause of frothing issue is dried milk residue in frothing component i would take those apart a described in manual and give a good cleaning hi what do you recommend jura e8 ena8 or the delonghi ecam hi jbm depends on what is important to you feature wise personally if cost is no object i prefer the jura machine they are very user friendly and i prefer the design and ui between the e8 and ena 8 it is really about capacity the ena 8 is a sleek small and more modern design that is good for servicing no more than a couple of user imo water capacity is lower so you will be filling the reservoir more often especially if you do longer coffee a lot beyond that the e8 ha 2 milk froth variety while the ena 8 ha one type of froth here is an in home review of the ena 8 which will give you a good idea of what it is like to use on a daily basis and here is a review of the e8 hope that help i love that machine i want to make milk based drink and love the way that frother work in your opinion is this the best machine that ha a carafe for the milk in that price range just wondering if there is a different brand i should look at a well doe this machine have a 3 year warranty whole latte love thank you for you reply i am in the beginning of my research so not to concerned at this time about availability i would just like to find the machine brand that will give me the best cappuccino in a super automatic for maximum dollar1500 i really like the convenience of the carafe and the cleaning system i do not need all the different choice of beverage but i want a machine that is also reliable and with a good warranty haha is that too much to ask hi c there are other option in jura and gaggia machine the dinamica is currently out of stock jura machine tend to be more expensive but with color screen are easier to use hi i have the delonghi ellette and i am confused when i select long coffee or extra long coffee and then hit the double espresso button or single button what is the difference between doing it that way compared with hitting the dedicated stand alone long button hello i am wondering if you can recommend me an espresso machine i would like an automatic that is under dollar1000 cad having a great froth is important to me thank you hi jade at that price point i would go with a gaggia anima here is a product link and a review video aj hi good presentation i am from malaysia where can i purchase this machine thanks for your assistance hi aa thanks for the comment i would search for a delonghi retailer in your area would there be much difference between this and the plus model thanks the dinamica plus get rid of the the iced coffee feature but add a touch screen coffee pot option app control and user profile drink quality should be identical the extra feature will come at a higher price aj how tall can the glass be would it take costa glass for latte under with milk doe not seem so but would like to know for sure max cup height is 5 5 inch for both the coffee spout and carafe spout aj any idea if when the dinamica plus will be available in the u seems like a european only option atm i am between the dinamica and the gaggia cadorna prestige i like the iced coffee and actual milk frothing option of the dinamica but i have seen a lot of review of people saying it kind of complicated and they refer to the user manual a lot the dinamica plus seems to solve this issue the cadorna prestige seems very user friendly just no ice option and the milk carafe seems like a pain to clean on that weekly and monthly recommended cleaning regiment whole latte love ok great thank you once again thats what i wa juggling around the wife like ice coffee in the summer time so that would be great the gaggia it is then thank you appreciate it you are welcome it also look like delonghi removed the iced coffee feature on the dinamica plus in favor of a coffee pot option so if that is a selling point for you then maybe the non plus version would be better i do not think that waiting for for the coffee to cool off would create any problem other than inconvenience i have not personally done it but i am guessing brewing a coffee on the cadorna with low temperature lower volume highest strength and just brewing it into an ice filled cup would be comparable to the result from the dinamica aj whole latte love awesome thanks for the response i appreciate it i like the gaggias one touch feature a well the dinamica plus also ha this feature it a different touchscreen display than the dinamica offered here in the state all the review of the plus are from people in the uk or australia from what i have seen so for iced coffee with the gaggia would you just wait for it to cool off then add ice later so it doe not get watered down or doe waiting for it to cool create a different set of problem coffee wise i am about to buy one or the other from you guy just trying to iron out the detail before i hit the button it quite an investment so i would like to really know what i am getting into first thank you i am not sure about the dinamica plus or if when we will be carrying it i will say the dinamica with lattecrema is much more user friendly than the previous dinamica model without the screen on that one i had to refer to the menu a lot but not on the lattecrema model a for the dinamica v cadorna cleaning the carafe is not much harder on one v the other there is a dial on the dinamica carafe that rinse the tube and an equivalent quick clean feature in the cadorna menu this is recommended on each machine after making a milk drink daily take about 15 second and doe not require emptying the carafe it is recommended to also disassemble and wash the carafe part on both weekly the gaggia also ha a deep clean menu option which involves putting cleaning product in the carafe and more thoroughly clean the milk system monthly it is not a troublesome a it sound but old milk can be gross so it is definitely better to keep up with it each machine ha it advantage such a iced coffee on the delonghi and one touch americanos on the gaggia they are both solid choice but for my personal us and user interface i prefer the cadorna prestige aj i have got to say i love our whole latte love i am not sure what happened to the rest of my comment above i do love my machine but we have had some trouble with it frothing milk the trouble started immediately after the first de scaling procedure wa done the identical thing happened to my son is identical model machine his also quit frothing immediately after de scaling we have 2 brand new machine with the same problem the delonghi warranty process is very frustrating and reason enough to avoid their product hi g amp l thanks for the sharing the love my delonghi 350 55b choked at it grind setting 3 and below frustrating by any chance were you using really oily bean those tend to do bad thing to super automatic machine did the issue resolve itself when you used a courser grind aj great video and i have a question what is your grind setting my espresso only have little crema hi snake thanks for the question for espresso we typically start at the finest grind setting and back off if needed crema production is dependent to coffee type classic italian style bean blend usually produce the most crema especially those with some robusta bean in the mix great video very detail do you have any idea how much for one espresso coffee bean used range from 1 5 strong level i saw in another review comment part you give gaggia machine each different coffee type how the coffee and milk range for delonghi auto machine it always a mysterious how much bean used for 1 esp whole latte love thanks much that is very useful info i have another question today i got a scale and weight one piece of used coffee ground from delong auto machine the piece is from a esp set to 4 and when i weight it is after 12 hour so it is dry enough the weight is 29g i searched the google but can not find any info regard used coffee grand is generate from how much coffee bean used so if set to 4 is 9g bean why used coffee ground is almost 3 time more maybe it is a stupid question but it puzzled me much hi my thanks for the comment and question delonghi doe not specify weight of coffee used for each brew cycle based on my experience i estimate it us from 6 10g per espresso depending on strength setting classic italian dose weight for a single espresso is 7g great video aj you profiled this delonghi machine excellent thank you hi jaime thanks for the comment glad you enjoyed the video aj love the video just wondering how this compare to the dinamica plus model with touchscreen and app is it newer than the lattecrema and the question which would you choose i thought the dinaminca plus ha the option of ice coffee whole latte love thanks so much great feedback hey paul i have personally never used the dinamica plus but it look like it add the touchscreen and app control a you mentioned a well a the option to brew a full pot of coffee it also seems they removed the iced coffee feature so something to consider if you want that option other than those different drink everything else should be the same internally and drink quality will be identical look like there is about a dollar500 difference so it all depends how much you value those luxury feature personally if i wa going to get into that price bracket i would probably look at the jura ena 8 aj what are the dimension on this machine hi jaime for most every product you can find the dimension listed in the spec section on the product page great video thank you i wa given this machine for christmas and hate reading instruction manual video guidance is so much better george george do you need a cuddle really dislike it when people do not read the manual and complain when thing go wrong or worse would rather call someone doe read to get there answer sorry it is a pet peave hold over from my service technician day hi david thanks glad you found it useful enjoy the machine aj can this be used in a small cafe where i sell about 30 cup a day whole latte love which commercial fully automatic machine do you recommend then which doe not cost an arm and a leg thanks hi tb it is a machine intended for home use so not recommended in commercial cafe marc i watched the demo today christmas for the delonghi dinamica latta creama my question is about the coffee drink how doe it compare to a regular coffee or is it actually an americano and the demonstrator called it coffee hi elissa the coffee on this machine run hot water through the ground throughout the entire extraction rather than an americano which go through the ground for the espresso then clean hot water on top if you set your grind a little courser the coffee should be in the ballpark of what you would expect from a standard coffee you would get at a coffee shop if you leave it very fine a you would for espresso you will get closer to what the italian call a lungo aj hi really enjoy your video in reading your response to some of the question asked it is clear that you tend to prefer the gaggia cadorna prestige over the dinamica given the complexity of these machine reliability is always a concern what ha been your experience in dealing with both manufacturer also how do both model compare price wise thank you hi peter thanks for the question with proper maintenance a recommended by the manufacturer these machine can last many many year we regularly get report of machine with 15 000 brew cycle on them of course there are always exception which is where warranty can help give peace of mind should something go wrong delonghi ha a 2 year limited warranty through them a an authorized warranty repair center for gaggia we know these machine inside and out and are able to offer a 2 year part and labor warranty in house price often change based on promotion but currently the dinamica with lattecrema is dollar1 200 and the cadorna prestige is dollar1 700 here are link to both aj this doe not seem automatic to me at all you are dialing in foam dialing in grinder guessing at when to cut off milk and espresso it seems very inconsistent to me also seem like nothing is automatic about it at all hi t well once that stuff is set you can push a button and it is extremely consistent far simpler cleaner and more convenient than prosumer level semi automatic machine will this machine make an americano hi ja you could make americano but it would be a 2 step process adding the water separately the gaggia cadorna machine do a true americano in 1 step with complete control over amount of espresso and water check them out in this video i am not getting enough froth with my milk drink i am using the highest setting for frothing and i am using 2percent milk should i be using 1percent or skim milk whole latte love thanks for your quick reply i do not think it is dirty component the machine is a new dinamica which doe an automatic self rinse and we use the clean function on the frother after using it so it must be the milk hi ja personally i use whole fat milk for it is smooth creamy texture but any of those milk should produce froth most common reason for poor frothing performance is dirty component disassemble frothing component and clean thoroughly great video i am considering replacing my second gaggia purchased from wll the anima deluxe doe this machine have a removable brew group what is involved in cleaning thanks whole latte love thanks couple other question doe the iced coffee feature only make iced coffee or is it also capable of making an iced espresso shot or maybe lungo we drink a lot of iced latte here in florida so this would be a huge plus also are there any super automatic that use a ceramic burr grinder hi j thanks for the comment and your patronage yes the dinamica doe have a removable group cleaning is similar to the anima here is a link to the dinamica owner is manual with complete care instruction anyone have suggestion for setting up the dinamica lattecrema for the first time i e running hot water through the system to clear out impurity hi jeffrey a with any superauto you will want to pull several shot through the machine when you set it up for the first time before drinking any do not worry about if these look weak or discolored that is normal the machine will perform an automatic rinse every time it is turned on or off which help keep the system clean for some other best practice for new machine check out this video we posted last week aj bought this and been using for about a month it work great and really love the machine seems to need to be descaled pretty frequently however i foresee it getting expensive to use their descaler if it is this often it need descaling what is your opinion and recommendation for descaling the dinamica thanks andrew sterling i am looking to get this machine and my biggest complaint with the super automatic is the milk is not hot enough any feedback is greatly appreciated whole latte love thanks for the quick response you guy are great hi andrew thanks for sharing your love for the machine i recommend descaling the machine when the machine alert to do so alert are based on water hardness set when you initially set up the machine descaling maintenance is very important scale build up is single biggest reason for problem down the road like changing oil filter etc in a car proper maintenance assures long life and proper operation we always advise using the descaling product recommended by the manufacturer it is formulated in proper strength for the product wow that is what we want too where did you get the coffee cup that you used in this demonstration hi gary amp linda the cup used the video are a combination of bodum and delonghi glassware here are link to collection of each aj is it possible to use heavy cream instead of milk this lattecrema system thank you so much i am so excited about my christmas gift now hi melissa i have never personally done it but i have read review of people doing it on other superautomatic machine it should not do any damage to the machine but i am not sure about the quality of froth it will produce aj hi do you use espresso bean or coffee bean for this machine or is it the same bean we would be brewing both regular coffee and espresso thanks whole latte love hi aj you are a great presenter and very knowledgeable but i tried the maroma orphea and hated it it is a robusta arabica i tried to find out the percentage but the coffee company could not tell me because they do not actually do the roasting or the blending my guess is based on amount of crema produced in an espresso the robusta percentage is quite high which explains why it is so inexpensive btw neither wll or the coffee company could provide roast date it is worse than buying starbucks at least starbucks give you a window of time for roast date based on the use by date on the bag hi robyn thanks for a great question although bean are often labeled espresso there is no actual espresso bean you can use any type of bean or bean blend to make espresso and many bean used for espresso make excellent regular coffee a well one of my favorite i use in these machine for both espresso and regular coffee is maromas orphea read the review at the link above and see if it fit your taste thanks for the video i just got one quick question if i use the bypass for ground coffee when i select a drink will the machine automatically know or do i need to tell the machine that i am using ground coffee whole latte love last question if i adjust the heat on the setting will that also increase the heat of my milk when i use the lattecrema system hi anthony when using pre ground you would hit the aroma strength button until it display an icon with a little scoop indicating pre ground once you select your drink it will then use the grind you put into the bypass doser aj should i go with new dinamica this in video or philip 5000 series with lattego hi marko i have not personally used the philip 5000 but it appears to be nearly identical in look and functionality to the gaggia anima prestige but the gaggia machine is le expensive the dinamica will give you more drink option but the anima prestige will offer many of the same feature at le cost aj i just received this machine and the milk coming from the system is barely warm it is around 120 degree and make a lukewarm cappuccino delonghi told me this is how the machine is designed to operate is this the same experience you have had tania i had the coffee temp on the highest setting we tried everything even video chatted with their customer service and were not able to resolve it their excuse is that italian espresso drink are not the same temperature a what american like to drink their drink and the machine wa operating a designed we returned the machine because it did not produce anything more than a warm latte i would not recommend this machine if you want your latte to actually be hot not just warm eric bartgis just wondering if you also have the coffee temp to the highest setting he did mention in another comment you can change the coffee temp setting please let me know since i am interested in buying this machine but like my coffee hot whole latte love thanks for the reply the milk wa coming into the cup in the low 120 range the latte i made this morning with the machine had an in cup temperature of around 120 a it wa brewing delonghi had me run rinse cycle before frothing milk and it still only produced 120 degree milk and and they said this wa normal i do not like my coffee to be scalding hot but this temperature wa what a 15 minute old latte taste like from my nespresso machine i would be very surprised to hear that people would accept the temperature that is coming out of this machine hi eric thanks for the question all machine manufacturer design machine to heat milk to the sweet zone which run 130 145f that is the same temp a well trained barista will froth to go much hotter and milk start to lose the apparent sweetness added by heating that said some machine produce a noticeably warmer froth in that range than others in cup milk temp are affected by a number of variable like starting milk temp cup type and froth type on machine with adjustable froth density the le airy setting usually produce a cooler milk i have read that one quark about this machine is that it run a cleaning cycle and flush water every time you turn it on i could see how that might be annoying if we should be turning it off every night is this machine designed to be left on all the time also doe the gaggia cadorna prestige do the cleaning cycle each time it is turned on too i am trying to choose between those two thanks whole latte love love you guy thank you hi chris thanks for the question most every super automatic machine will do a rinse when turned on and turned off it is part of keeping the machine clean rinse the coffee delivery circuit and put fresh water into the thermoblock boiler prior to use machine can be left on but most do shut off eco mode after a user defined amount of time the cadorna for instance will shut off automatically up to 3 hour after turn on i should mention there is no real advantage to leaving a machine on continuously even if you could most all are ready to brew in well under a minute from turn on the cadorna doe do the rinse in my opinion it is a more capable machine than the delonghi the cadorna prestige is our daily driver in the studio we have had a bunch of different machine a daily driver and the cadorna is our favorite   great video enough to make be buy one thank you for sharing hi michael thanks for the comment and i am glad you found the right machine for you enjoy the coffee aj what size cup did you use when you made the cappuccino thank you hi robert that wa a 16 ounce cup aj hi between this model and the philip 3200 lattego any big difference or preference since the 3200 might me a little bit cheaper thanks hi joseph i have never personally used the philip 3200 lattego but at a quick glance it look like it ha le grind setting le drink presets no iced coffee a little cheaper but also le function filled aj thank you for the informative video and thank you for everything you guy do quick question doe this machine make an americano grace shin choi i prefer long black which is espresso poured over hot water it preserve the crema and taste of the coffee bean hi robert a grace mentioned this machine can make an americano in two step brew your espresso shot then dispense hot water over it some machine like the gaggia cadorna line can do this process with one button aj americano is just espresso shot and water you can add water after getting espresso shot help i am losing sleep because i can not decide between the de longhi dinamica lattecrema atutomatic coffe and espresso machine or the gaggia cardona prestige super automatice esspresson and coffee machine thre is a 700 dollar difference and ice coffee on the de longhi what is the better machine better taste hi courtney a you mentioned the benefit of the delonghi are the price difference and iced coffee though the current price difference is dollar500 on our web site it also ha 18 pre programmed drink to the cadorna prestige is 14 yet i found the cadorna is drink list to have more real world relevance to what most people would choose the cadorna prestige win pretty much everywhere else better screen user profile one touch americanos swapping milk order preparation etc drink likely will not taste extremely different on the two but for convenience and user experience i would consider the cadorna prestige the better machine aj hi do we have how control the milk temperature hi caroline i do not believe you can adjust milk temperature on this model a a workaround if you want hotter milk you can adjust the coffee temperature to a hotter setting and or pre warm your cup aj hey thanks for your video they are helping me really much on learning about coffee machine casual and direct question would you recommend this one or the gaggia magenta milk hi andrea you are welcome for the video and thanks for your question unfortunately i can not give an opinion on the magenta milk a it is not a machine available in the u market at this time i can say i prefer the gaggia cadorna prestige what is the difference between the bezzera bz13 de pid and the new bezzera crema de pid hi gman thanks for the question they are essentially the same machine the crema ha different button and wood trim marc if i had to pick one this unit or the gaggia cadorna prestige whole latte love can cardona prestige brew ice coffee hi do thanks for the question well you need to evaluate the feature of each unit and how they fit your coffee espresso drinking style desire if me i would go with the cadorna prestige i love the true americano proper double shot flat white and xl latte and cappuccino for milk drink to go marc cool review guy i really enjoyed it the dinamica look pretty neat i am seriously thinking about getting one i know this may seem a bit unusual from an italian but i really enjoy filter coffe what can you tell me about the option of making something similar to filter coffe with the dinamica is it possible did you guy try it whole latte love this look great thank you aj hey sebastiano the dinamica ha two option one they call coffee which is essentially a much longer pull through the ground a shown in the video the other is called long which will likely be closer to what you are looking for for this they use a pulse brewing method at a lower pressure to simulate drip filter coffee it will also pause in the middle to grind a second time this preparation take longer but doe a pretty good job at creating something closer to filter coffee aj i am learning so much from your channel i am looking to get my first espresso machine and i have been going nut between thing like the juras and i am even looking at the more manual machine like the synchronica but this one actually look like it would be a terrific first machine for me whole latte love thank you so much i will check it out hey vegasplayer you are right in that it is a good starter machine it will not have the flair of jura or the customizability of some of the gaggia machine but the price point will certainly be lower if you are interested in an entry level manual machine we refer to them a semi automatic machine check out the gaggia classic pro this type of machine generally take a little more work on the user is part to dial in your variable instead of simply pressing a button like on the delonghi and requires a separate grinder but the result you can get are undeniable here is a recording of a live stream we did featuring the classic pro part of what we consider the best value entry level home espresso machine and grinder combo aj what can you say about the cleaning of the inner system a you probably know most of the automated expresso machine have this problem with mold coffee in the inner system how easy can this machine be cleaned hi sergiu regular cleaning help prevent this issue and delonghi is straight forward with their cleaning procedure the dinamica performs an automatic rinse cycle any time it is powered on or off which help clear out the internal circuit there is a removable brew group referred to by delonghi a the infuser that you should remove and clean once a month by soaking in water for 5 minute then rinsing with warm water no soap the descaling process is straight forward and prompt you when to do it the place i most often see mold in super auto is inside the dreg drawer when spent coffee puck have been left to sit for a while this can be solved by emptying the drawer more regularly or if you do encounter old moldy puck a quick rinse spray with the faucet clean it out easily aj what are your view on this amp the gaggia cadorna prestige besides being able to adjust the milk froth any opinion on which make the better cup amp is easier to use amp maintain thanks whole latte love what is the temp like when in cup hey 4wolverines love the cadorna prestige imo the cadorna line are the best superauto machine of the year the dinamica with lattecrema is great and certainly an improvement over the previous version but the cadorna prestige is in another weight class that said you will pay more for it around dollar500 right now the dinamica win with it adjustable milk froth and iced coffee feature but the cadorna prestige win in user interface drink selection customizability and user profile i did not dig a ton into the cleaning on the dinamica other than the quick carafe clean show in the video which is a nice feature we have been using the cadorna prestige a our daily driver in the studio for many month and use maintenance is simple very clear maintenance menu for quick milk clean deep milk clean descaling and brew group cleaning i have not done direct side by side drink comparison but straight espresso should similar for be each cadorna is ability to flip milk espresso preparation order give you more option and better quality in cup for some milk based beverage and the one touch americano is a great option cadorna will also grind tamp brew twice for double espresso ristretto lungo coffee which the dinamica will not so it win there if you are making two drink at once aj this look great they are sold out though be grateful machine ha been nothing but a headache since i gave it to my wife for christmas it wa nice when it actually worked like it should hi synthea this machine is back in stock now in very limited quantity we are expecting a larger shipment at the end of november aj i sell a lot of coffee machine i often see return of delonghi product due to faulty manufacturing i have not used them myself but customer used to come in asking about why their machine quit usually an unnecessary censor went out or something hi tvm thanks for the comment video just showed up 1h ago machine already sold out how much back in stock now in limited quantity currently listed at dollar1 199 95 aj that machine look amazing hey joel it is definitely a great value for what it doe and a huge improvement over the older dinamica aj out of stock hey silent killer the machine is back in stock right now in very limited quantity we are expecting a larger shipment at the end of november aj

brew extraction and pulse extraction he also say you can use the bypass for flavored espresso like oily bean it will not clog the inside of the machine can you put flavored oily bean in the pre ground slot since i keep hearing the issue is with the oily bean is with the burr and grinding but the pre ground bypass bypass that unless you grind the coffee yourself pourquoi pa en francais model number

benaderet who care if the delonghi rep make a crapy latte he is there to demo his product and boost sale which he did i purchased the dinamica because this demo reviewed the operation of each button i

your comment for after they have completed each section of the entire presentation gail is constant interruption were very distracting work on that excellent product excellent review of it is operation despite interruption agreed the frother look underwhelming i wa a little worried about it it feel and move like it is going to break on me but it is nice not having to do any work it froth milk and milk substitute just lovely use cold thought for better result bonjour je suis kassen de maroc de suis tr s int res par ce que vous faite et sp cialement ce qui concerne delonghi pouvez vous me donner le contact ou adresse mail de mr jamie de delonghi je serai tr s reconnaissant et merci d avance can not do an honest review when the vendor is right next to you making a crappy latte i am about to change my mind about getting this machine after seeing how phony the rep wa same here i wa comparing this to philip 3200 lattego which is dollar800 only which win this one for sure iced coffee sold denise aberin why not buy a le expensive machine and brew really strong coffee you are going to have to ad ice cube with any machine she compared this model to a compareable but le expensive sako model which she described a just a good wow delonghi ha really american ized their product to appeal to american consumer no such thing a iced coffee or your cup of joe in italy hahaha it doe not make regular coffee like the magnifica sadly i had already bought this when i realized it only made expressos vladmasters i have only tried flat white espresso and cappuccino so far they are all quite different you have to adjust the setting for each type and personal taste mrtimmu67 that is if you taste it straight with no sugar or creamer like a true coffee drinker mrtimmu67 they all taste really strong and have practically the same taste they are diff option but just about the same thing come out no idea where you got that from i have just bought one and it doe all type of coffee look at the video can i set it to brew regular coffee in a travel mug about 12oz will a travel mug fit under the spout lexi021009 you said regular coffee not americano get your fact straight to me regular coffee is not an americano it is drip jrpg w e e b bud sorry i offended you ever heard of americano go hide behind your keyboard i do not get why people still want drip style coffee out of machine that are clearly made for espresso you are not looking at the right machine bud what you want is a drip coffee maker not an espresso one 12oz is a lot of coffee try using the two cup at once option thanks for the tip on not using oily bean which hold true on all self grinding coffee maker i can not wait till my two machine need replacing i have two on counter self grinding with 12 cup pot and another machine that us expensive pod coffee and auto frother to make cappuccino and latte this appears to be my next dream machine biased review yep just received it today it is amazing love it hey babe just got a delonghi ecam35020 dinamica today what a great product our old standard basic manual delonghi machine ha started to leak after maybe 10 year of quite intensive use so it wa time for u to upgrade to a super auto most of the time we are americano drinker and the dinamica doe that easily and the hot water coming coming off the paranello is super hot which wa not the case with our old machine so we usually boiled water separately in a kettle no need for the kettle anymore no more messing with the grinder tapping cleaning up the counter top etc it is our first super auto and being used to do everything manually every morning this push button machine amazes me the dinamica is based on the ecam line which is supposed to have a better and more reliable boiler than the previous esam series we occasionally go for decaf especially for late night dinner with guest and since our old machine wa ese pod compatible we found using ese pod for an occasional decaf wa very practical the dinamica can not use pod but can use pre ground so we just open up a ese pod and drop it in very convenient a it is already pre measured for a single shot which is what the dinamica requires we tried the long drip style coffee but did not think much of it tasted bitter to u the americano wa much better for u may be with a different grind or bean one would have to experiment so far we are very pleased this machine ha everything we were looking for your old machine could possibly have easily been repaired for 100 200dollar maybe by an authorized repair shop knowledgeable w delonghi my old esam 3200 keep going strong after a feew minor repair however i did purchase this dinamica unit on a whim they make similar espresso on the finest grind option note this dinamica doe not have a top cup heating tray compared to other delonghis excellent video i just purchased this machine and the video ha helped me learn some of the basic operation jess cuz i actually ended up going with the phillips lattego i have been using it for a few month now and i really love it the milk cup is super easy to clean since it ha no tube bob belvick i am really close to pulling the trigger on the 35025 which is a step up from this with the premium wand bob belvick i have had mine for about 3 day so far i really like it wanted a quality espresso in a full auto with the option for drip coffee coffee is very good quality although coffee cup size is small at default luckily you can reprogram quantity up to 8 45oz per draw definitely a learning curve over my nespresso how do you like the machine i am thinking about buying one i have never had one like this before i have a ninja now doe it make a hot cup of americano style coffee also how many oz of regular coffee will it make yes but based on review and response seems you will need to learn which grind and strength setting work best for the americano a few attempt at these adjustment should help you get the best cup of americano for your taste yes the hot water coming off the steam wand is quite hot this is a great machine for americanos the regular coffee mode try to mimic drip coffee but so far we did not like it that much tasted bitter could be the grind or bean i do not know it is just over 5 oz not a very large cup we prefer making americanos with double shot in a cup then add water from the steam wand and it is a hot a if coming from a kettle the machine heat up very fast almost no wait the man from delonghi seems a nice guy but he ha a staccato and jerky presentation style this video would be far better with gail just by herself she is great get over yourself everyone is different i enjoyed the video gail seems so happy today i wa thinking that raspberry syrup would have tasted great in the iced drink your coffee bean should never be oily that is a sign of over roasting and it is terrible people do not understand that there is no such thing a an espresso roast it is a specific blend of bean to optimize the intended flavor of a particular coffee for espresso it should be known a an espresso blend this is why every legit specialty shop lean towards light roast maybe medium at the absolute darkest also steaming half and half is great it is known a a breve doe the double just double the volume of water or doe it grind more coffee too jess cuz yes there are two spout the coffee come out of both every time so you can position the cup or cup so one cup is centered in the case of espresso the two cup are placed so the espresso go into both vessel and you can hit the x2 and it will run twice you just leave the cup or cup in place i am still using this pretty machine every day it is great you can center one espresso cup or position two so both fill just press espresso then the 2x for it to run twice serendipitous sun so you could use it for 2 espresso cup a well then grind twice a well two volume into one or two cup really appreciate you made every video i am going to buy a full automaton coffee machine and i prefer the touch screen and i like delonghi this brand name but they just have one kind delonghi super automatic espresso coffee machine ecam65085ms can you make a video talk about this style and will delonghi make of new version touch screen fully automatic coffee machine did you ever figure out what you needed for ecam65085ms iced coffee make me want to gag i do not know how anybody can drink cold coffee but hey to each their own same applies to gender genitalia everyone ha their own preference i simply adore cold coffee seattle coffee gear would you recommend this dinamica over the magnifica esam3500 seattle coffee gear i like cold brew coffee and today wa 35 degree but thats on the c scale getting very warm and so dry man miss seattle 88f here and downing a hot latte off my scg pid silva jay g i have tried it and it is gross
2,Delonghi Dinamica Review and How To Make a Latte with it!,you can tell she ha not read the manual because it say to not mess with the grinder knob great video you got right to the point and made it feel natural which is appreciated v a long 20 minute video review that is drawn out and doe not feel real awesome job and great video thank you for helping and going over a lot of the machine save a lot of time i watched your video so many time this is exactly what i wa looking for i just bought mine today and will be getting it tomorrow i found a company here in vancouver bc and lucky for me i bought the white one i am super excited thank you for your awesome video greeting from canada this guy is are using wrong coffe fuck just get to the point i think you guy did a good job i have this machine and have since moved up to the jura giga 6 but out of all my machine i keep this one a backup 10 16 roula whats that mean do you mean the french word voila i wouldnt get this machine mine never worked and delonghi is totally understaffed and took a full month to even send me the return label for repair wish i could get my dollar1000 back i really enjoyed watching this thank you for sharing your experience i have just ordered mine waiting for delivery so looking forward to it you say your first youtube video i have to say i really loved how natural you both behave no need to stress about making the video perfect so it wa refreshing to watch you two not that the video had anything wrong in it anyway but still it felt natural and spontaneous oh and also yeah definitely dip the frother nozzle in the milk jar before you turn it on you were wasting steam there but also you will burn yourself with that hot steam bursting out in the air and also no mess that way jesus she is so annoying ooh man you guy are total amateur and you do not know how to use this machine at all oh my god the frothing the horror the woman speaks like a machine gun mg42 let the man speak she is very irritating oh i thought they were sweet together she is just excited thank you good review well informed got mine today love it she is so blondie i froth in the cup then put it under and push what coffee i want le mess 51 sub hahaha never watched a quality review with a channel that ha only 51 sub wow god damn i thought i had it bad run diego run this woman is irritating and ha no way she just screwed up she is a valley girl and there is no cure among all the other video i found yours to be the most helpful and that it is what matter to me thank you so much you need to pour the milk slower and move it closer do not dump it in like that plus best milk for frothing is semi skimmed milk to get a nice infused coffee with milk and a nice froth on top thanks fella great video i have read that pike place is an oily bean and can break your machine that lady poor poor guy will this do a cold froth oh and you could heat up the milk in the microwave using a bowl before using the french press it will give you a fairly close result to a steamer or a steam wand just to clear some thing out there is no such thing a cold froth from a steam wand if you want to froth milk a a cold drink you can use a french press or manual frother there are a bunch of video on youtube showing you how to froth milk on a french press i use a french press to make iced latte on a hot summer day just got this in black and i am super jealous of your white version haha thank you for this video the instruction on this machine are horrible and not friendly at all super excited to make a cappuccino tomorrow morning d jesus woman you irritating she keep interrupting him let him speak what an awful voice she ha the couple ounce of water that flush out at the beginning from what i have heard is a small cleaning cycle and it is just cleaning off some leftover coffee from the last time the machine wa used anyway great video watching you make that cup of coffee definitely helped me decide that i need this machine thank you for making this video and helping me make my decision on which machine to buy awesome guy thanks for a real review the maker came with an awful instruction manual it is how to make it difficult instruction just bought mine today in gray a a replacement for my 12 year old saeco odea giro machine thank you for the review and congratulation on your channel stop yellinnnnnng she is loud but she is cute would have loved to be able to have the sound on but she is just yelling so much omgolll shhhhh i just bought this machine and read the manual before using the machine it say lesser amount of coffee button the one you referred a a single shot refers to espresso whereas more amount of coffee button referred a a double shot in the video refers to a lungo when i google the difference between a lungo and double shot espresso most post suggest that the lungo us much more water and for a longer time therefore not exactly same a a double shot espresso the manual also explaines regular espresso make about 40 ml of shot and lungo make about 120ml which is 3 time more not double so i have been just using 2x button to make 2 of the single shot cause that seems to be the closest thing i can get a a double shot using this machine yes you are right they definitely got it wrong i think this is a great video got me started on the machine and the couple is cute but i do feel the same regarding that option that they mentioned a a double i think delonghi also call the big cup icon a lungo also in the manual unless italian call drip coffee also long i do not know gon na email delonghi i wan na know my dosage and do it conveniently first world problem a double shot of espresso is a doppio yes i saw this in a video by the manufacturer these couple is adorable and i appreciate the review so much but they are mistaken about the lungo button a you stated here lt 3 lol did everything the messiest way that beautiful milk art at the end then dump pumpkin spice in lol poor guy dude ha my sympathy i upvoted this 20 second into the video  thank you for the informative video just got my machine today this is exactly what i needed congrats on the channel excited to watch you grow hey thanks for sharing such a great review i have subscribed feel free to check out my review all the best truepreview

4,Delonghi Dinamica | 18 Months Later!,i am debating if i should get the dinamica plus or a refurbished jura e8 i have heard mixed review regarding de longhi is reliability and customer service is there anyone who is owned one for an extended period of time that can speak into this thanks in advance computer lcd screen failed after 6 month get extended warranty on this type standard warranty in canada is 2 plus one year so you should be covered i wouldnt get this machine mine never worked and delonghi is totally understaffed and took a full month to even send me the return label for repair wish i could get my dollar1000 back that suck would you say this is a good choice for someone who ha a small space and primarily want coffee espresso and americano with the ability to add frothed milk we are not really into latte or more milk based drink it is a good machine and a nice choice also look at the jura ena 4 just doe coffee and the new smeg superautomatics we have video on those also awsome review and thank you so much about the latte art comment i thought i wa just really bad at it good review i feel better about the wand now so torn between white and silver the white is gorgeous but i think silver would go better with my other appliance i would love to have one of these machine on my counter top if delongi are calling semi automatic they need to re define machine and semi and automatic kenneth karlsen hello we call this a semi automatic the milk steamer i do suggest the latte crema version of de dinamica or the dinamica is not this a super automatic ec coffee espresso amp coffee gear thanks for the explanation tough terminology i ve heard people call portafilter machine semi automatic too how would you call these the definition are a bit vague yes it is to some but since the milk is more manual we refer to it a semi when the milk come through a connected carafe and you have to do nothing we call it super
