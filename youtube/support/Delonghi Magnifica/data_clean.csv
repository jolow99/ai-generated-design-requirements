0,DeLonghi Magnifica ESAM 3300 | Crew Review,i have had his coffee maker for 8 year and i love it a few year after i bought it i bought one for my girlfriend and she us it every morning and love it nice review i just got mine yesterday and brewed my first cup this morning for the first cup it wa pretty damn good just remember to turn the steamer off before putting the milk container under it i did not do this and made a mess one thing not mentioned is the cup warmer on top of the machine i did not know about this when i bought it and it wa a very nice surprise having a warm mug to start is supposed to help with ending up with a nice hot cup of joe have it for a long time 5 or 6 year still working fine and it make alot of coffie about 1 kg of coffie every single day since we bouth it would this be good to make tea for guest who do not like coffee i just opened for the first time and i can not get it to heat the water nothing happens from step 5 on the startup very frustrating silly woman you are supposed to wait till the light stay on permanently for the milk frother our magnifica esam 3300 is still running strong since 2011 just make sure to keep up on the cleaning and de calcification my only complaint are that it doe not do well with oil bean we still do but just hand to use a coarser grind and temperature is not hot enough for my taste i hardly ever use the frother since it take forever to heat when i do i cheat and microwave the milk to get it warmed before frothing it with the esam just got back back from san juan and had some good coffee even the one from the hotel pod machine tasted better so now thinking about getting a replacement but have a sentiment attachment to the magnifica can you make regular coffee too you can make a americano water down expresso not exactly the same a from a drip but ok hi you mentioned not to buy too oily coffee bean for this machine not sure if i understood right did you say medium roast bean are best would you be kind to recommend a few brand that are ideal for this particular coffee maker please thank you whats the best position dial for the coffee grinder love the machine too for all it feature ease of use water filler bean filler is excellent a you are not refilling after every couple of cup the frother is a dream no nozzle pop off and last but not least easy disassembly for cleaning true it is noisy dare say loud but the biggest con is that it doe not make very hot coffee or at least i do not see where the water temp is adjustable to make it hotter despite the you tube vids that show it not happening on my model esam 3300 big con when i add me half and half to me coffee it is lukewarm real bummer any advice about whether i should buy gaggia brera espresso machine or delonghi magnifica esam 3300 or esam04110s thanks again gail picked this up for 13dollar at a thrift store it wa dirty and had seen some use but a little maintenance and it started right up just needed a descaling and some elbow grease i will probably replace the o ring and the snapped steam knob next d easy fix great result ahh no oily dark roast bean that is a deal killer you do not want to wake dababy just received my coffee machine and the coffee is terribly sour what do you how to adjust it i tried different grinding scale we have this machine in the office and so far i have figured out that the coffee bean dial go from 7g to 14g of coffee min to max and i set the water volume so that i get around 20 of extraction time one dot to the left of centre for the bean that we are using it give a good result the water volume switch in my refurb unit never seemed to work unfortunately any tip on how to get it to work hey i have like the machine i want ask you what is the mill number please your review helped u decide on the delonghi esam3300 just purchased this machine via amazon priced nicely unfortunately y all were out of stock looking forward to setting it up and using some home roast for espresso so if i want half decaffe like i get in my starbucks double shot on ice 5shots drink this would be a good machine since you can put ground coffee in the other side thank you for this tutorial i wa struggling to make capuccino jus got the machine yesterday but now i see it is pretty straightforward i do not want to make art i just want my foam with my coffee by the way the taste is pretty good must be the bean i am in mexico in 2020 today i buy that would anyone recommend this over her 2019 recommendation would seattle gear say that those 2019 recommendation are better those 2019 one seem to be in the same price range i want a super automatic but i prefer bean that are oily what to do would you prefer this one or the breville barista express espresso i know they are not comparable straight across but i am between those two dearsarahhhh i have not yet haha tim jon what did you end up getting looking for a machine that i can make espresso or coffee should i go with the delonghi esam 3300 or the breville barista express which is better good review but the camera keep focusing on you rather than the product and it is annoying what grinder setting do you use on automatic delonghi thank you mine broken help i think it in the water pump is the problem if you press the 2 cup button is the result more watered down than the 1 cup setting meaning i need to make the coffee setting stronger if i am brewing 2 cup there no foam how can you make a starbucks quality cappucino with that lol i just got this machine for my birthday this year 2019 i just love it so simple and convenient to make multiple latte for guest is fast and easy i highly recommend this machine dad sent me this a a gift it is pretty much the greatest thing he is ever done for me i have had mine for over a year great product i lost the tip to the steamer contacted the mfg and for a small charge dollar30 the sent them out received within in 2 week great review thanks she doing good i loved thank you this helped me to make a decision on a new coffee machine which one is better this one or breville bes870 great review wonderful delivery this really helped me get it so much more than reading about it thanks so much i do not like that the plastic bit contact food casing sure food no your review is great just got this and am loving it kudos to seattle coffee gear hi just recieved this yesterday trying to figure out how to make a good shot of espresso with crema using starbucks espresso roast already ground should i have the store grind it for me at an espresso setting or is it fine to buy foreground or buy bean and use the fresh grind side lastly which setting are good for good crema i usually just want 2 shot please and thanks preground thank you for the review it wa very helpful to get me started i am using lavazza super crema in my new magnifica 3300 it taste great until the last sip which is bitter sour should i treat it like my beer and just throw the last sip out or is there something i can do to make it good to the last drop hi jeanette lavazza super crema tends to taste that i dunno why though but i just go with it and that part really hit me to stay awake haha but the aroma of it is so darn good have you reviewed the delonghi esam 4110s i have searched and searched but can not find a review like your others ha anyone ever had this problem my espresso shot come out in drop rather than in a stream i have tried adjusting the left knob amount but it still come out in drop adjust the grinder you may have it set too fine for your bean delonghi magnifica esam 3300 or perfecta esam 5400 what setting are suggested to get a creamy espresso have had mine for a day and realize for optimal result the grinder should be on 2 3 with minimal water and maximum coffee dispersion this typical for most super auto awesome let u know if any issue come up thanks so much for the quick reply i purchased a corsica from la colombe not too oily a recommended taste great did not initially realize the machine break in during the first 5 7 espresso getting better each make it sound like you have got it pretty dialed in what bean are you using how old are they i bought an esam 3300 based largely on this review and i have to say it is just a described a great little machine for the money it is easy to use and make a solid cup of coffee a nice purchase for anyone who doe not have the cash to spend on a super deluxe model but would like something a bit more user friendly than those express type machine this is the kind of news we like to hear on a monday happy it worked out that is a pretty nice machine still made in italy i do not know designed probably made for sure not adjustable wrench k adjustable wrench romania on my box gail scg team thanks for your great video i purchased this machine a few week ago and love it is it possible to add a water filter to the tank if not can i put one in anyway and let it float in the tank aiman b wait no it doe not that is one drawback of this model is no internal filter so you have to use filtered bottled water to reduce the descaling frequency i tried using the water from my fridge which ha a built in filter and it is very soft by their meter which is great did not realize that thanks it ha a water filter inside the unit in the 12 year of my latte enjoying experience i have owned 3 super automatic one saeco incan noto which wa complete junk two delonghi a 3400 and a magnifica compact the 3400 lasted 6 year with a plethora of use and my magnifica is going strong for 4 year do yourselves a favor go with a delonghi they are italian espresso workhorse gale what coffee and grind setting do u recommend doe bunny still work at seattle coffee gear great video like all your video i just bought myself a newer version of this machine the esam4200 a quick question what would you suggest for the grinder number and coffee amount combination to get a good espresso with medium roast coffee bean that is not a newer version it is just the version that use for 220 240v electrical system instead of the 110v in the u let be honest shall we in the word of ispinal tap on a scale of 1 to 10 i go 11 in other word i crank up the maximum amount of coffee to be ground for i enjoy the flavor i have been using lavazza brand whole bean coffee for it is a much drier bean and will not clog jam up the feed system both seattle coffee and whole latte love offer great deal on lavazza whole bean coffee happy latte i do have it amazing coffee machine at the moment the grind is on number 3 coffee amount is on max and play around with cup size what setting are you using do u still have the machine what grind setting and ever thing else setting do u use ordered a refurbed one on the black friday sale come tomorrow can not wait woohoo is this machine good for an office of 8 people it is been good for an office of 15 for a few year now bought a refurbed unit about a year ago still rocking my sock best coffee i have ever had at home and my guest love it anytime love this thanks for sharing d can we come over hehe hi gail thank you for your helpful review vids i have decided to get a coffee machine but am crushed between ascaso dream collection and delonghi 3300 ascaso cuz it is beautiful and unique and delonghi for it convenient super automatic feature i got ta admit that i have not made coffee by myself before but enjoys a glass or two throughout the day so i am worried that i may not be able to make a good coffee with ascaso espresso machine but the design of it keep dragging me back to it what would you do if you were in my shoe thanks so much for reading my comment jj s which machine did you go with of the two seattle coffee gear thanks for the reply i usually drink americano and occasionally espresso hello if you go for the ascaso do not forget about a grinder the delonghi will certainly make this task earlier is espresso what you like to drink so i just got this refurbished unit from you guy i had a manual delonghi and typically did a double shot and made an americano what setting would you recommend i start out with to achieve a decent shot using illy medium roast bean not a huge fan of the styling design of this one but i love love love that the water reservoir slide out from the front nthnmc easy access for sure thanks for watching i currently own a esam 3300 that i found in great condition on craigslist for dollar70 great machine i love everything about it just be careful with the steam dial it take some force to turn and i have heard some people say theirs ha broken off joshua rhoads excellent glad you are enjoying your machine thanks for sharing your experience can not be a loud a a grinta new video every day subscribe over 100 crew review watch visit u online thanks for watching all our video folk you are the best great to see another super automatic review i have missed them one con i can see at least for my taste is how it look generally i like the look of saeco and jura more than delonghi but this one is just not sexy at all the cheaper jura model that do just coffee like ena micro 1 are more sexy than this one
1,DeLonghi Magnifica S Bean to Cup Coffee Machine Review + Unboxing & Setup.,pretty good review apart from the really annoying background music i love this machine so good this model lack the main switch right what i liked about this model is that it doe not have an onboard clock mybest kitchen i live in my rv where the 120v go off and on often a i move around so it wa impossible to set the clock therefore it came on or went off at odd time this one doe not have the temperature setting either so it is a little hotter than i wa used to i drink 5 6 cup of coffee a day caf and decaf different flavor a reliable k cup machine is perfect for me and my lifestyle hey kev i appreciate the review there is not many of bean to cup machine that mete mortal can afford on youtube haha do you know how this unit compare to the ecam250 the dual mode steam wand on that seems appealing using the steam wand without the sheath on my old unit ended up causing some damage hence looking for a new one why this kind of music tooooo high how is espresso compared to premium brand machine like jura is it big difference in my humble opinion it would take someone with an amazing palate to be able to detect much difference in shot quality from one bean to cup coffee machine to another especially when we are talking about domestic bean to cup machine and not the far more expensive commercial machine when it come to the espresso side of thing they all use a brewing unit and an integrated grinder usually with very limited adjustment when you pay more for a home bean to cup machine you are usually paying for additional feature not improved espresso quality cheer thanks for the video a the written instruction are not great the coffee is not hot enough for me is there a trick to increase the heat hi john re the coffee you are talking about the temp of espresso you can try upping the brew temp just fucking dry the fucking spent ground puck and fucking weigh them quit the fuckn acting the music kill me yeah it is not a great choice in hindsight cheer hey i bought a magnifica s used on the internet here in sweden the owner had used the machine a few time and wa not happy with the result and put it back in the original box and sold it after a month i myself like espresso and latte and therefore over the year had several full manual and semi automatic espresso machine the latest purchase wa a bambino plus sage breville for my daughter doe not like brewed coffee and thought she could fix breakfast coffee herself with the bambino when i no longer had the opportunity to make coffee for her because we got up at different time in the morning it did not work for her despite the semi automatic bambino wa very easy to use i thought that is why i bought the almost fully automatic magnifica s it went well for her i became curious about how well you could set the right coffee grinding and amount of water so i used a whole afternoon to regulate the mill amount of water and the slider for intensity i think it regulates the amount that may need to be adjusted depending on the type of coffee you use and how coarse or fine the grinding is to improve the coffee and wa quite surprised at how much better it could be today i also use the machine every day when i am in a hurry and use the others when i have more time ok it doe not make barista made coffee but the result is very good for such a cheap machine i paid 100 dollar for a almost new maskin just bought this machine and this video wa really helpful thanks i did not bother rinsing anything actually just ran a couple of cycle of hot water through and steamed the wand i have the same machine steaming is my problem removing the outer wand i tried but then the inner one pop out for the rest i like the coffee use a black cable tie solves it i picked up one today and wa really intimidated by it but have been watching you and others and think i will be ok with it the background music is annoying and really unnecessary quite off putting but the video wa informative thank you just got this coffee machine for christmas now to find a coffee bean that i will enjoy any tip for a decent strength coffee not too bitter thank you for the tip hi i have the same machine but i want to make cappuccino but i do not know what coffee bean to use and the volume of the milk hope you can help me with this thanks for the video it wa insightful especially for me who is a newbie when it come to coffee making view of this v a brera dear robert a you expressed desire to see the critique rather in comment than a dislike i will elaborate i already placed a comment under another video about gaggia and after i just removed it and thought of walk away just before i get across this review first thing guy like me wan na see is the time of espresso extraction max bean lowest water smallest grain on grinder a timer and a tared scale with a cup original sound so we can hear how long grinder work how long it take to make 30 ml of espresso max bean weight we get from product spreadsheet and we all set i assume there are not many of such people but if there are some this is might be a source of dislike if you have any gl could you maby show in detail how to froth steam the milk i can not get mine to do it properly tank an good video i faced the same problem can not get enough foam thanks for this kev same name just letting you know i have bought the machine because of your awesome review unboxing and setup here cheer mate you have got a sub cheer kev good unboxing and first review video just wished you use milliliter for liquid and gram for solid wa bit confusing at some point thanks i wa weighing the shot which is why it make sense to talk about the coffee in gram not ml but it is about the same a ml of espresso is a gram ish any idea on why my machine doesnt let me re set the amount of water it pours for each coffee if i press and hold the button it doesnt not flash or let me choose i have the magnifica s smart 250 and it say you can do that in the manual but no luck i got one but have not use coffee bean at the moment huh i have just bought one and found this vid really good thanks the only thing is could you lose the music it is really really irritating and deflects from what you are saying coffee kev gave you an uptick anyway i think your video really useful no probs there is no music hehe just kidding the problem here is simply that i am an idiot and i kept moving away from the mic so with the background music which ha to be put in the background really for demo etc to cover a lot of the little annoying noise that would be even more irritating without it at one level sometimes it is too loud compared to my voice i am still quite new to this video stuff but if you go back and watch my slightly older video you will see that they are infinitely better than they were ta kev not impressed with built quality durability of material used by delonghi i bought a prima donna esam6900m 4 year ago and it is quite frustrating to see that multiple plastic part have started to disintegrate i had to completely refurbish the grinder unit because of a plastic part that decided to come off and found it way into the internals i would expect that from a cheap machine but from a quality brand like delonghi i deem this unacceptable coffee kev well actually it wa a load of different part to sum it up it started with the hinge of the lid of the bean container then the little key at the back of the drip tray that signal wether or not the drip tray is in place and one of the mounting point of the upper housing gave way that last happened the moment i had to disassemble the machine in order to salvage the coffee grinder unit which completely derailed after a piece of the bean lid hinge dropped in to top it off the diffuser started to show serious sign of incontinence a well no aggressive cleaning agent were ever used on the machine unfortunately the drip tray alone cost about 90 gbp to replace so repair by delonghi themselves is deemed to be economically unviable superglue absolute patience and extreme care during maintenance will be key to keep the coffee machine running until i have the budget for a more professional espresso set up probably the delonghi ha a limited capacity i bought the machine on the 15th of april 2019 and produced 10345 drink mainly espresso with it that is just over 11 cup of espresso on average per day would that be too much for a consumer machine i hear you bert that is frustrating what plastic part wa it that ended up mangled i just got one of these at kohl is about 2 week ago it wa about 1200 1300 and kohl is had a 40percent coupon so i ended up getting it for a little over dollar800 in addition kohl is gave me about dollar160 in kohl is cash since they had another deal that for every dollar50 spent we get dollar10 so overall it is like if i got for dollar680 not a bad deal right it is a great deal for the u fortunately for u in europe it about 300 euro wow i bought it in italy and it cost like 250 300euros price in usa are crazy hi chris that look like a very good deal considering the usa rrp nice video a usual just make sure you pronounce magnifica correctly with caffeinated love from italy thanks re the pronunciation i am a brit if i try to pronounce it properly it will end up like an episode of allo allo how doe it deal with the puck is there a bin inside it that need emptying yes there is a bin empty it each and every day a it tends to mold up very quickly humid warm etc a bean to cup machine need quite a lot of cleaning and laziness in that take down the taste of your brew very quickly hi dave yeah an internal dump box it prompt you to empty when full cheer this wa my only adventure into home espresso that i bought in january this year no matter what i did i could not get the strength to my liking i am not an espresso person so that go against me i exchanged it and bought a sage precision good review kev cheer robert yeah bean to cup espresso machine are not for everyone and if filter is your thing the precision brewer is definitely a better choice and in my opinion among the very best when it come to filter machine interesting i think i will stick with the separate grinder and coffee machine but that seemed to work quite well there wa a slightly mumbly bit in the middle i missed the price but a i am not buying one i guess that doe not matter for me i see you have been putting your finger in the grinder again i am not going to try that coffee kev ouch i know the feeling just a well you were wearing glove cheer haha thanks jim me too but a far a bean to cup machine go not at all bad for the money yeah sorry for the mumbly bit that is mainly because i am an idiot the finger haha i wish i could say they were coffee related injury or something really interesting unfortunately it is really dull i wa helping my next door neighbour take off a set of conservatory door and they fell on my hand oops i had glove on too cheer i thought all engagement wa good engagement you do not take instruction literally enough when it said rinse any part that might come in contact with water or milk you should have just thrown it all in the sink and hosed it down haha i will do that next time
2,Delonghi magnifica Review - A Great Entry Into Super Automatic Machines,today would you buy this model again or would you rather buy philip 4300 i honestly have not liked any of the philip i have had they are ok but the espresso quality just doe not match the delonghi in my experience i have used older philip and the newer 2200 and 3300 and have not been impressed if you want something that doe auto frothing go with the higher end delonghi or the terra kaffee bang for buck i have a dark roast coffee that i absolutely love but it is oily doe this delonghi have a bypass for pre ground coffee i am just now starting to research coffee maker we have had a philip saeco italia for about 15 year that finally bit the dust and it seems like a lot of people say do not use oily bean is that true for every coffee maker out there or do i need to go to a semi automatic like i said i am new to this maybe the oily bean is what finally made the italia die semi automatic would be better since you could get a grinder that can handle oily bean but the delonghi doe have a by pas also the temperature is at 4 red light on joe varacalli at the manual i read when the machine is on behind there is a button on position i then on front if you press and hold the one cup button on the buttom you see red light thisis the temperature of hot water in scale from 1 red light to 4 red light in which you have set your machine check the manual if you wish sorry it is been awhile since i watched this video can you elaborate a bit more or tell me when in the video this is referring to whats the grinder setting ihave it at 2 or between 2 and 1 from 3 and above i think it very coarse and the coffee come watery yeah we go between 2 and 1 5 some time corser like 2 5 if we are just making coffee would you still recommend the stumptown holler mtn for this unit joe varacalli ty alex yeah there is a coffee amount dial turn it to the max and then hit the brew button a second time when that time you are shooting for happens joe varacalli i will try that thank you how do you keep it going longer i hit the two cup button and wait until it is done can i adjust that time alex how old our your bean check the roast date make sure it is atleast 7 day out and may need ten day from roast date next i keep the coffee ground amount to the max and try and go a fine a possible this will maximize extraction and lower the chance of underextracting sour next run the shot alittle longer from the point of first drip shoot for maybe 25 to 35 second let me know if that help joe varacalli what is your setting on this machine with stumptown so that the taste is not sour i have tried adjusting the setting and still can not get the sour taste out i set the grind to 1 and both knob in the middle to mask the sourness if i turn the knob to a 3 the sour taste intensifies wanted to see what you are doing the infuser can not be removed while the machine is on that is why it would not come out you are correct figured that one out after lol i have the same machine now 9 year and today she died and now i have dilema lol because i really do not know what machine should i buy ohhh my god let me help you out you can always buy the same machine i still think it is very good are you still wanting a super automatic i found one of these on craigslist for dollar200 with an included extra infuser i also found a gaggia brera for dollar290 but it is only a year old i really like strong coffee and espresso unfortunately i can not afford a true manual espresso set if you just wanted a machine to make strong americano style drink and a machine that not hard or expensive to maintain would you choose the older magnifica 3300 for dollar200 or the year old gaggia brera for dollar290 joe varacalli thanks unfortunately it sold i would go with the delonghi i still think this machine is the best super automatic in term of strong espresso just got one of thee machine joe what are the dial setting for water coffee you tend to use i have mine dialed in for a single shot but i have heard all the double button doe is double the water since my coffee setting is about 3 4 of the way up it feel like i would get too much water instead of a real double shot rob stevens sorry idk why the link did not post the first time this is my list of best coffee i have reviewed rob stevens this is my current list of best coffee bean they are all pretty good the only one i would not go crazy for is starbucks blonde roast it is hit or miss super crema is actually very good in term of coffee quality i appreciate the reply i landed on 2 5 for the grind setting with my current setting sound like i should play around a bit more started with lavazza super crema got a great deal but any other coffee you recommend for this machine yeah i keep the ground coffee amount cranked all the way up the water volume i typically keep half way up and just manually stop brewing at around 2oz the best way to get a dial in on a super automatic is to just use time and volume since you can not really weigh anything so shoot for 2oz out in about 20 to 27 second at first drip honestly it is hard to over extract in this machine generally speaking since it us a pressurized filter basket generally my grind size is at 2 or 3 you can pull the brew unit out but the machine must be turned off first yeah i realized that a i wa recording lol it is a great feature to be able to clean the brew unit thanks for the good review i owned a similar model for 10 12 year had it repaired once or twice but used it numerous time over that period for the price absolutely no complaint make a good quality coffee yeah they make a couple similar product and gaggia make something called the brera which is almost identical i moved on to a semi automatic which is much more of a pain but the end product is just a bit better

i did not like being stuck to buying pod all the time so i gave it to my grandson a he is moved into his own place so the search wa on i really wanted a sage one but the price were a bit silly so i opted for this one it arrives tomorrow and i can not wait to get started with it rilliant review thanks so much x my sage died on me after 6 year paid gbp700 for it and can not justify spending that much to replace it it wa a manual barrista type but i have got this one coming today will let you know whether we both should bite the bullet and splash out on a sage very helpful thanks brilliant review one of the most professional i have seen online very honest a well p i think you need a new battery in your smoke alarm what an absolutely fantastic review i am dashing out to buy this tomorrow x hi i will know where i can find or buy a manual introduction because i lost i leave in belgium tks have you looked on their website you can usually download the manuels there  thank you soooooo much great video great video our water hardness wa effective zero please change the battery in your fire alarm before you and your coffee machine die in a tragic fire i almost went crazy with that sound  do you have to heat the milk yourself before using the frother excellent video our delonghi magnifica esam4000 is coming tomorrow from amazon so we are now well prepapred many thanks i also checked my kitchen smoke alarm is esam 3000 model dicontinued if so why in dubai they are selling at cheaper price but honestly im not happy at all and im wondering if that model is faulty ann idea folk did you have any problem with the machine not working a it should up to now did any thing break or crack thanks very informative and well presented just checking in to make sure you are all still with u and have not burned in an horrific fire bit much why would that happen s lol i wa just checking in again to see whether you would renewed the battery in your smoke alarm yet so annoying and completely negates any credibility you may have attained in the making of this video best cappuccino or latte method is to heat the milk first then press the steam button again to disengage steam mode and purge the wand until only hot water come out and the espresso light stop flashing this take about 10 second much quicker than just waiting and the milk is still hot by the time the shot are done how do i get 1 shot of espresso from this machine ryan yard 30ml in one espresso shot what doe that have to do with your question and my comment you asked how to make one shot espresso which she show in the video ryan yard you have clearly never been to a coffee shop did you not even watch her video where she explains everything in crystal clear detail jeez how do you take out the water tank i had to check my fire alarm but it wa not the one that wa so insanely annoying it is amazing that you can post such a video do you like to annoy or are you on another planet buonasera e possibile traduzione in italiano i brought one a year ago and it make great coffee instant coffee is not same anymore i do not think i can say enough about this machine gt gt gt ur2 pl 1166 i have never had a smoother wonderful cup of coffee i work in starbucks and we always make milk first not the coffee when you make capuccino we have a rule that coffee should not sit for such a long time by itself because it turn not so good after all you have to mix with milk asap also when you make milk froth start from the botton and slightly lift it up so you will get a better result do not lift up and down whole the time just small tip for everyone she did it the right way like italian do in italy starbucks is wrong jezabel s i think you are from costa lol you work in starbucks you are in no position to give advice on coffee lol if you make the milk first then press 1 or 2 cup button so it flash and the steam light go out you can use the frother to clean the plastic froth tube removable this sort the coffee compartment so you can instantly use coffee sandra kawaii can you make a tutorial video d very detailed video thank you very helpfull kiss from romania big corey from the uk waiting for ya ai aceast masina de cafea esti mul umit spune mi mai multe detalii daca il ai mersi i have noticed that when i use steam first then i switch it off to brew coffee boiler warming up forever i am deciding then to turn it off and on again to warm really quick it is strange because it supposed to have two boiler other way work fine coffe then milk then turn off marcin it is actually cooling down after steaming all you have to do to speed up the process is immediately after steaming press the steam button or one of the coffee button so that both coffee button flash then open the steam hot water tap and let some steam and hot water out for about five second until the button stop flashing voila ready to make coffee again thank you so much i have had my machine over three year now and you have just shown me where the ground coffee go i thought it wa a bean only machine i bought it today and this is the best manual i have found thanks a lot in coffeeshops the crema is a little different it thiker and ha another colour nice review thank you i have the same machine make an acceptable cup of coffee when using the strongest bean and set to produce the strongest coffee though the coffee is nothing to write home about being not particularly hot and not particularly strong however the really poor aspect of the machine is it design with respect to cleaning it really seems to have been designed to make it cleaning a difficult a possible some of the used ground fall outside the removable container into which they are supposed to fall so the inside of the machine which is full of nook and cranny becomes very dirty the ground container itself is designed not to be easily cleaned and the drip tray is a total disaster of design seemingly made to be a difficult a possible to clean and then to dry not recommended hi nice demo thanks im thinking of using this in my shop please can you tell me exactly how long a break doe it need between cup to cool and how much approx doe it cost per 1 medium cup of americano your answer would really help my decision cheer can i make hot chocolat im lost can i make a coffee just with only ground coffee already a i try and sometimes doe not work for me the machine it is really about bean a you have found sometimes with ground coffee it doe not work max 1 spoon of ground coffee per time what if you want 6 cup for 6 people change the battery in your smoke detector sporter470 it is changed now sorry if it annoyed you brilliant video very informative useful to watch prior to purchase one thing that doe put me off is that i seek the traditional scream of milk scolded with a proper espresso machine is steam wand i also note that in this video clip the wand is neither wiped after use nor purged prior to being placed in the jug of milk if one is spending so much money on a top of the line coffee machine it is worth taking the trouble to find out how to correctly steam milk for coffee that require it i understand from a barista that some will use a thermometer to ensure the right uniform milk temperature while others judge it is correct when the jug is too hold to hold such video a this would be even better if updated after a few month of experience is gained you should purge the steamer a little bit to get rid of water ur review is pretty awesome and clear thx i just wan na know how to make my espresso taste stronger with le water fai c turn your bean quantity knob fully clockwise and grind more finely nice geordie accent a well i just bought one of these it is great if you read the instruction you will find it straight forward to

then get one of these thanks once again blogger mummy lauren thanks for your reply lauren very helpful video people such a yourself are a godsend to people that need genuine user review richard aldridge hello richard yes machine is still working perfectly and i am very happy with it it is a good machine will it do just hot water yes liam if you turn the steam wand dial without pressing the steam button first hot water should dispense from the wand i have just bought one of these and you can adjust how hot you want you coffee to come out which is great it seems that you can adjust just about everything on this machine child also love a hot chocolate which is easy to made with the steam attachment the only thing i would like them to change is the amount of coffee bean you can load thanks for posting such a detail video i had one in the past an i did find the coffee could be hotter but this one is great savage savage you have to press and hold the 1cup button for 5 sec adjust with 2cup button then finish with 1cup again the light signify the heat setting is it working properly till now any problem maleka58 where can you adjust the temperature of the coffee i have the corso one the milk frothing is not hot enough but froth very quickly how is yours is it how suppose to be or there is something wrong with mine lisa lily hi lisa on this one the milk froth up quickly but it doe take a bit longer to heat up once you have got a good froth submerge the wand in to the milk and leave it there for a while to heat the milk up a bit once your milk jug is almost too hot to touch it is generally ready might be worth buying a thermometer that you can leave in the jug which will tell you when it is hot enough hope that help i have just been out to the kitchen 3 time to clear the fault log in our yale alarm your alarm is beeping how can i trust your review if you can not even replace 9v battery in your alarm matityah perhaps my alarm only started beeping the morning of the review i can assure you the battery ha since been replaced thanks for your comment loved the review thanks chris i appreciate your kind word just to let first time user know that you have to make 3 cup before you get a decent flow until then it tends to drip i thought it wa due to me having the bean grinder setting too fine but i think it wa just sorting itself out give it a few cup and it should be fine the manual will tell you this exact thing if you bother to read it thanks for a great review lauren just had mine delivered today and judging by your setting i think i made my first cup way too strong a i had the cup size all the way to the right and it nearly took my head off how do you make an americano perfect i will give it a try thanks again x darren altman hi darren i am glad you like the review honestly it took a little playing around with the machine to get the strength to my preference for a true americano dispense some hot water in to your cup from the wand if you use the wand without pressing the steam button it dispenses hot water and then put it under the coffee spout and add a shot of strong coffee for a long coffee we tend to put strength to around half and cup size to max and press 1 or 2 cup depending on the mug size hope that help
