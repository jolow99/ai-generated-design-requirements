0,i have had his coffee maker for 8 year and i love it a few year after i bought it i bought one for my girlfriend and she us it every morning and love it,nice review i just got mine yesterday and brewed my first cup this morning for the first cup it wa pretty damn good just remember to turn the steamer off before putting the milk container under it i did not do this and made a mess one thing not mentioned is the cup warmer on top of the machine i did not know about this when i bought it and it wa a very nice surprise having a warm mug to start is supposed to help with ending up with a nice hot cup of joe,have it for a long time 5 or 6 year still working fine and it make alot of coffie about 1 kg of coffie every single day since we bouth it,would this be good to make tea for guest who do not like coffee,i just opened for the first time and i can not get it to heat the water nothing happens from step 5 on the startup very frustrating,silly woman you are supposed to wait till the light stay on permanently for the milk frother,our magnifica esam 3300 is still running strong since 2011 just make sure to keep up on the cleaning and de calcification my only complaint are that it doe not do well with oil bean we still do but just hand to use a coarser grind and temperature is not hot enough for my taste i hardly ever use the frother since it take forever to heat when i do i cheat and microwave the milk to get it warmed before frothing it with the esam just got back back from san juan and had some good coffee even the one from the hotel pod machine tasted better so now thinking about getting a replacement but have a sentiment attachment to the magnifica,can you make regular coffee too,you can make a americano water down expresso not exactly the same a from a drip but ok,hi you mentioned not to buy too oily coffee bean for this machine not sure if i understood right did you say medium roast bean are best would you be kind to recommend a few brand that are ideal for this particular coffee maker please thank you,whats the best position dial for the coffee grinder,love the machine too for all it feature ease of use water filler bean filler is excellent a you are not refilling after every couple of cup the frother is a dream no nozzle pop off and last but not least easy disassembly for cleaning true it is noisy dare say loud but the biggest con is that it doe not make very hot coffee or at least i do not see where the water temp is adjustable to make it hotter despite the you tube vids that show it not happening on my model esam 3300 big con when i add me half and half to me coffee it is lukewarm real bummer,any advice about whether i should buy gaggia brera espresso machine or delonghi magnifica esam 3300 or esam04110s,thanks again gail,picked this up for 13dollar at a thrift store it wa dirty and had seen some use but a little maintenance and it started right up just needed a descaling and some elbow grease i will probably replace the o ring and the snapped steam knob next d easy fix great result,ahh no oily dark roast bean that is a deal killer,you do not want to wake dababy,just received my coffee machine and the coffee is terribly sour what do you how to adjust it i tried different grinding scale,we have this machine in the office and so far i have figured out that the coffee bean dial go from 7g to 14g of coffee min to max and i set the water volume so that i get around 20 of extraction time one dot to the left of centre for the bean that we are using it give a good result,the water volume switch in my refurb unit never seemed to work unfortunately any tip on how to get it to work,hey i have like the machine i want ask you what is the mill number please,your review helped u decide on the delonghi esam3300 just purchased this machine via amazon priced nicely unfortunately y all were out of stock looking forward to setting it up and using some home roast for espresso,so if i want half decaffe like i get in my starbucks double shot on ice 5shots drink this would be a good machine since you can put ground coffee in the other side,thank you for this tutorial i wa struggling to make capuccino jus got the machine yesterday but now i see it is pretty straightforward i do not want to make art i just want my foam with my coffee by the way the taste is pretty good must be the bean i am in mexico,in 2020 today i buy that,would anyone recommend this over her 2019 recommendation would seattle gear say that those 2019 recommendation are better those 2019 one seem to be in the same price range,i want a super automatic but i prefer bean that are oily what to do,would you prefer this one or the breville barista express espresso i know they are not comparable straight across but i am between those two,dearsarahhhh i have not yet haha,tim jon what did you end up getting,looking for a machine that i can make espresso or coffee should i go with the delonghi esam 3300 or the breville barista express which is better,good review but the camera keep focusing on you rather than the product and it is annoying,what grinder setting do you use on automatic delonghi thank you,mine broken help i think it in the water pump is the problem,if you press the 2 cup button is the result more watered down than the 1 cup setting meaning i need to make the coffee setting stronger if i am brewing 2 cup,there no foam how can you make a starbucks quality cappucino with that,lol,i just got this machine for my birthday this year 2019 i just love it so simple and convenient to make multiple latte for guest is fast and easy i highly recommend this machine,dad sent me this a a gift it is pretty much the greatest thing he is ever done for me,i have had mine for over a year great product i lost the tip to the steamer contacted the mfg and for a small charge dollar30 the sent them out received within in 2 week great review thanks,she doing good i loved,thank you this helped me to make a decision on a new coffee machine,which one is better this one or breville bes870,great review wonderful delivery this really helped me get it so much more than reading about it thanks so much,i do not like that the plastic bit contact food casing sure food no,your review is great just got this and am loving it kudos to seattle coffee gear,hi just recieved this yesterday trying to figure out how to make a good shot of espresso with crema using starbucks espresso roast already ground should i have the store grind it for me at an espresso setting or is it fine to buy foreground or buy bean and use the fresh grind side lastly which setting are good for good crema i usually just want 2 shot please and thanks,preground,thank you for the review it wa very helpful to get me started i am using lavazza super crema in my new magnifica 3300 it taste great until the last sip which is bitter sour should i treat it like my beer and just throw the last sip out or is there something i can do to make it good to the last drop,hi jeanette lavazza super crema tends to taste that i dunno why though but i just go with it and that part really hit me to stay awake haha but the aroma of it is so darn good,have you reviewed the delonghi esam 4110s i have searched and searched but can not find a review like your others,ha anyone ever had this problem my espresso shot come out in drop rather than in a stream i have tried adjusting the left knob amount but it still come out in drop,adjust the grinder you may have it set too fine for your bean,delonghi magnifica esam 3300 or perfecta esam 5400,what setting are suggested to get a creamy espresso have had mine for a day and realize for optimal result the grinder should be on 2 3 with minimal water and maximum coffee dispersion this typical for most super auto,awesome let u know if any issue come up,thanks so much for the quick reply i purchased a corsica from la colombe not too oily a recommended taste great did not initially realize the machine break in during the first 5 7 espresso getting better each make,it sound like you have got it pretty dialed in what bean are you using how old are they,i bought an esam 3300 based largely on this review and i have to say it is just a described a great little machine for the money it is easy to use and make a solid cup of coffee a nice purchase for anyone who doe not have the cash to spend on a super deluxe model but would like something a bit more user friendly than those express type machine,this is the kind of news we like to hear on a monday happy it worked out,that is a pretty nice machine still made in italy i do not know,designed probably made for sure not,adjustable wrench k,adjustable wrench romania on my box,gail scg team thanks for your great video i purchased this machine a few week ago and love it is it possible to add a water filter to the tank if not can i put one in anyway and let it float in the tank,aiman b wait no it doe not that is one drawback of this model is no internal filter so you have to use filtered bottled water to reduce the descaling frequency i tried using the water from my fridge which ha a built in filter and it is very soft by their meter which is great,did not realize that thanks,it ha a water filter inside the unit,in the 12 year of my latte enjoying experience i have owned 3 super automatic one saeco incan noto which wa complete junk two delonghi a 3400 and a magnifica compact the 3400 lasted 6 year with a plethora of use and my magnifica is going strong for 4 year do yourselves a favor go with a delonghi they are italian espresso workhorse,gale what coffee and grind setting do u recommend,doe bunny still work at seattle coffee gear,great video like all your video i just bought myself a newer version of this machine the esam4200 a quick question what would you suggest for the grinder number and coffee amount combination to get a good espresso with medium roast coffee bean,that is not a newer version it is just the version that use for 220 240v electrical system instead of the 110v in the u,let be honest shall we in the word of ispinal tap on a scale of 1 to 10 i go 11 in other word i crank up the maximum amount of coffee to be ground for i enjoy the flavor i have been using lavazza brand whole bean coffee for it is a much drier bean and will not clog jam up the feed system both seattle coffee and whole latte love offer great deal on lavazza whole bean coffee happy latte,i do have it amazing coffee machine at the moment the grind is on number 3 coffee amount is on max and play around with cup size what setting are you using,do u still have the machine what grind setting and ever thing else setting do u use,ordered a refurbed one on the black friday sale come tomorrow can not wait,woohoo,is this machine good for an office of 8 people,it is been good for an office of 15 for a few year now,bought a refurbed unit about a year ago still rocking my sock best coffee i have ever had at home and my guest love it,anytime,love this thanks for sharing d can we come over hehe,hi gail thank you for your helpful review vids i have decided to get a coffee machine but am crushed between ascaso dream collection and delonghi 3300 ascaso cuz it is beautiful and unique and delonghi for it convenient super automatic feature i got ta admit that i have not made coffee by myself before but enjoys a glass or two throughout the day so i am worried that i may not be able to make a good coffee with ascaso espresso machine but the design of it keep dragging me back to it what would you do if you were in my shoe thanks so much for reading my comment,jj s which machine did you go with of the two,seattle coffee gear thanks for the reply i usually drink americano and occasionally espresso,hello if you go for the ascaso do not forget about a grinder the delonghi will certainly make this task earlier is espresso what you like to drink,so i just got this refurbished unit from you guy i had a manual delonghi and typically did a double shot and made an americano what setting would you recommend i start out with to achieve a decent shot using illy medium roast bean,not a huge fan of the styling design of this one but i love love love that the water reservoir slide out from the front,nthnmc easy access for sure thanks for watching,i currently own a esam 3300 that i found in great condition on craigslist for dollar70 great machine i love everything about it just be careful with the steam dial it take some force to turn and i have heard some people say theirs ha broken off,joshua rhoads excellent glad you are enjoying your machine thanks for sharing your experience,can not be a loud a a grinta,new video every day subscribe over 100 crew review watch visit u online thanks for watching all our video folk you are the best,great to see another super automatic review i have missed them,one con i can see at least for my taste is how it look generally i like the look of saeco and jura more than delonghi but this one is just not sexy at all the cheaper jura model that do just coffee like ena micro 1 are more sexy than this one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,i really love coffee and taking serious coffee preparation thanks for these useful information like,if you need hot water for a long coffee you do not need a kettle you can simply turn the knob without pressing the steam button,true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,pretty good review apart from the really annoying background music,i love this machine so good,this model lack the main switch right,hey kev i appreciate the review there is not many of bean to cup machine that mete mortal can afford on youtube haha do you know how this unit compare to the ecam250 the dual mode steam wand on that seems appealing using the steam wand without the sheath on my old unit ended up causing some damage hence looking for a new one,why this kind of music tooooo high,how is espresso compared to premium brand machine like jura is it big difference,in my humble opinion it would take someone with an amazing palate to be able to detect much difference in shot quality from one bean to cup coffee machine to another especially when we are talking about domestic bean to cup machine and not the far more expensive commercial machine when it come to the espresso side of thing they all use a brewing unit and an integrated grinder usually with very limited adjustment when you pay more for a home bean to cup machine you are usually paying for additional feature not improved espresso quality cheer,thanks for the video a the written instruction are not great the coffee is not hot enough for me is there a trick to increase the heat,hi john re the coffee you are talking about the temp of espresso you can try upping the brew temp,just fucking dry the fucking spent ground puck and fucking weigh them,quit the fuckn acting,the music kill me,yeah it is not a great choice in hindsight cheer,hey i bought a magnifica s used on the internet here in sweden the owner had used the machine a few time and wa not happy with the result and put it back in the original box and sold it after a month i myself like espresso and latte and therefore over the year had several full manual and semi automatic espresso machine the latest purchase wa a bambino plus sage breville for my daughter doe not like brewed coffee and thought she could fix breakfast coffee herself with the bambino when i no longer had the opportunity to make coffee for her because we got up at different time in the morning it did not work for her despite the semi automatic bambino wa very easy to use i thought that is why i bought the almost fully automatic magnifica s it went well for her i became curious about how well you could set the right coffee grinding and amount of water so i used a whole afternoon to regulate the mill amount of water and the slider for intensity i think it regulates the amount that may need to be adjusted depending on the type of coffee you use and how coarse or fine the grinding is to improve the coffee and wa quite surprised at how much better it could be today i also use the machine every day when i am in a hurry and use the others when i have more time ok it doe not make barista made coffee but the result is very good for such a cheap machine i paid 100 dollar for a almost new maskin,just bought this machine and this video wa really helpful thanks,i did not bother rinsing anything actually just ran a couple of cycle of hot water through and steamed the wand,i have the same machine steaming is my problem removing the outer wand i tried but then the inner one pop out for the rest i like the coffee,use a black cable tie solves it,i picked up one today and wa really intimidated by it but have been watching you and others and think i will be ok with it the background music is annoying and really unnecessary quite off putting but the video wa informative thank you,just got this coffee machine for christmas now to find a coffee bean that i will enjoy any tip for a decent strength coffee not too bitter thank you for the tip,hi i have the same machine but i want to make cappuccino but i do not know what coffee bean to use and the volume of the milk hope you can help me with this thanks for the video it wa insightful especially for me who is a newbie when it come to coffee making,view of this v a brera,dear robert a you expressed desire to see the critique rather in comment than a dislike i will elaborate i already placed a comment under another video about gaggia and after i just removed it and thought of walk away just before i get across this review first thing guy like me wan na see is the time of espresso extraction max bean lowest water smallest grain on grinder a timer and a tared scale with a cup original sound so we can hear how long grinder work how long it take to make 30 ml of espresso max bean weight we get from product spreadsheet and we all set i assume there are not many of such people but if there are some this is might be a source of dislike if you have any gl,could you maby show in detail how to froth steam the milk i can not get mine to do it properly tank an good video,i faced the same problem can not get enough foam,thanks for this kev same name just letting you know i have bought the machine because of your awesome review unboxing and setup here cheer mate you have got a sub,cheer kev,good unboxing and first review video just wished you use milliliter for liquid and gram for solid wa bit confusing at some point,thanks i wa weighing the shot which is why it make sense to talk about the coffee in gram not ml but it is about the same a ml of espresso is a gram ish,any idea on why my machine doesnt let me re set the amount of water it pours for each coffee if i press and hold the button it doesnt not flash or let me choose i have the magnifica s smart 250 and it say you can do that in the manual but no luck,i got one but have not use coffee bean at the moment,huh,i have just bought one and found this vid really good thanks the only thing is could you lose the music it is really really irritating and deflects from what you are saying,coffee kev gave you an uptick anyway i think your video really useful no probs,there is no music hehe just kidding the problem here is simply that i am an idiot and i kept moving away from the mic so with the background music which ha to be put in the background really for demo etc to cover a lot of the little annoying noise that would be even more irritating without it at one level sometimes it is too loud compared to my voice i am still quite new to this video stuff but if you go back and watch my slightly older video you will see that they are infinitely better than they were ta kev,not impressed with built quality durability of material used by delonghi i bought a prima donna esam6900m 4 year ago and it is quite frustrating to see that multiple plastic part have started to disintegrate i had to completely refurbish the grinder unit because of a plastic part that decided to come off and found it way into the internals i would expect that from a cheap machine but from a quality brand like delonghi i deem this unacceptable,coffee kev well actually it wa a load of different part to sum it up it started with the hinge of the lid of the bean container then the little key at the back of the drip tray that signal wether or not the drip tray is in place and one of the mounting point of the upper housing gave way that last happened the moment i had to disassemble the machine in order to salvage the coffee grinder unit which completely derailed after a piece of the bean lid hinge dropped in to top it off the diffuser started to show serious sign of incontinence a well no aggressive cleaning agent were ever used on the machine unfortunately the drip tray alone cost about 90 gbp to replace so repair by delonghi themselves is deemed to be economically unviable superglue absolute patience and extreme care during maintenance will be key to keep the coffee machine running until i have the budget for a more professional espresso set up probably the delonghi ha a limited capacity i bought the machine on the 15th of april 2019 and produced 10345 drink mainly espresso with it that is just over 11 cup of espresso on average per day would that be too much for a consumer machine,i hear you bert that is frustrating what plastic part wa it that ended up mangled,i just got one of these at kohl is about 2 week ago it wa about 1200 1300 and kohl is had a 40percent coupon so i ended up getting it for a little over dollar800 in addition kohl is gave me about dollar160 in kohl is cash since they had another deal that for every dollar50 spent we get dollar10 so overall it is like if i got for dollar680 not a bad deal right,it is a great deal for the u fortunately for u in europe it about 300 euro,wow i bought it in italy and it cost like 250 300euros price in usa are crazy,hi chris that look like a very good deal considering the usa rrp,nice video a usual just make sure you pronounce magnifica correctly with caffeinated love from italy,thanks re the pronunciation i am a brit if i try to pronounce it properly it will end up like an episode of allo allo,how doe it deal with the puck is there a bin inside it that need emptying,yes there is a bin empty it each and every day a it tends to mold up very quickly humid warm etc a bean to cup machine need quite a lot of cleaning and laziness in that take down the taste of your brew very quickly,hi dave yeah an internal dump box it prompt you to empty when full cheer,this wa my only adventure into home espresso that i bought in january this year no matter what i did i could not get the strength to my liking i am not an espresso person so that go against me i exchanged it and bought a sage precision good review kev,cheer robert yeah bean to cup espresso machine are not for everyone and if filter is your thing the precision brewer is definitely a better choice and in my opinion among the very best when it come to filter machine,interesting i think i will stick with the separate grinder and coffee machine but that seemed to work quite well there wa a slightly mumbly bit in the middle i missed the price but a i am not buying one i guess that doe not matter for me i see you have been putting your finger in the grinder again i am not going to try that,coffee kev ouch i know the feeling just a well you were wearing glove cheer,haha thanks jim me too but a far a bean to cup machine go not at all bad for the money yeah sorry for the mumbly bit that is mainly because i am an idiot the finger haha i wish i could say they were coffee related injury or something really interesting unfortunately it is really dull i wa helping my next door neighbour take off a set of conservatory door and they fell on my hand oops i had glove on too cheer,i thought all engagement wa good engagement you do not take instruction literally enough when it said rinse any part that might come in contact with water or milk you should have just thrown it all in the sink and hosed it down,haha i will do that next time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

side on the table fell down omg or do you pull on the part where the coffee flow through discharge,thank you for the video i watched 5 yesterday and not a single of them explained me so easy fir me to understand a this one i did my perfect cappuccino within a minute thanks a lot,that poweder ha be ground finer coffe come out too quikly,all the thing you do are wrong u should learn how to make coffee before u try to teach other ppl my little nephew would steam the milk better than u too much bubble,why are u so unfriendly,hello dear my question is can we take only hot water thank you in advance,great simple and brief review thanks,hi lauren what a tremendous review thanks very much indeed for sharing extremely informative soooo helpful i have checked several other review none a patch on yours just bought a mint one same model in silver arriving next week stay safe in these uncertain time,just got this for christmas brilliant review i feel a lot more confident making my coffee using the machine now very detailed tutorial cheer,great review i have this machine like for a year and you teached me how to make coffe with pre ground thanks so how much did you pay for it i gave 300eur thanks,i very nice pet,i have been humming and hawing about buying a new coffee machine for a short while i have had a tassimo for a few year which wa ok but i did not like being stuck to buying pod all the time so i gave it to my grandson a he is moved into his own place so the search wa on i really wanted a sage one but the price were a bit silly so i opted for this one it arrives tomorrow and i can not wait to get started with it rilliant review thanks so much x,my sage died on me after 6 year paid gbp700 for it and can not justify spending that much to replace it it wa a manual barrista type but i have got this one coming today will let you know whether we both should bite the bullet and splash out on a sage,very helpful thanks,brilliant review one of the most professional i have seen online very honest a well p i think you need a new battery in your smoke alarm,what an absolutely fantastic review i am dashing out to buy this tomorrow x,hi i will know where i can find or buy a manual introduction because i lost i leave in belgium tks,have you looked on their website you can usually download the manuels there,,thank you soooooo much great video,great video our water hardness wa effective zero,please change the battery in your fire alarm before you and your coffee machine die in a tragic fire i almost went crazy with that sound,,do you have to heat the milk yourself before using the frother,excellent video our delonghi magnifica esam4000 is coming tomorrow from amazon so we are now well prepapred many thanks i also checked my kitchen smoke alarm,is esam 3000 model dicontinued if so why in dubai they are selling at cheaper price but honestly im not happy at all and im wondering if that model is faulty ann idea folk,did you have any problem with the machine not working a it should up to now did any thing break or crack,thanks very informative and well presented,just checking in to make sure you are all still with u and have not burned in an horrific fire,bit much why would that happen s lol,i wa just checking in again to see whether you would renewed the battery in your smoke alarm yet so annoying and completely negates any credibility you may have attained in the making of this video,best cappuccino or latte method is to heat the milk first then press the steam button again to disengage steam mode and purge the wand until only hot water come out and the espresso light stop flashing this take about 10 second much quicker than just waiting and the milk is still hot by the time the shot are done,how do i get 1 shot of espresso from this machine,ryan yard 30ml in one espresso shot,what doe that have to do with your question and my comment you asked how to make one shot espresso which she show in the video,ryan yard you have clearly never been to a coffee shop,did you not even watch her video where she explains everything in crystal clear detail jeez,how do you take out the water tank,i had to check my fire alarm but it wa not the one that wa so insanely annoying it is amazing that you can post such a video do you like to annoy or are you on another planet,buonasera e possibile traduzione in italiano,i brought one a year ago and it make great coffee instant coffee is not same anymore,i do not think i can say enough about this machine gt gt gt ur2 pl 1166 i have never had a smoother wonderful cup of coffee,i work in starbucks and we always make milk first not the coffee when you make capuccino we have a rule that coffee should not sit for such a long time by itself because it turn not so good after all you have to mix with milk asap also when you make milk froth start from the botton and slightly lift it up so you will get a better result do not lift up and down whole the time just small tip for everyone,she did it the right way like italian do in italy starbucks is wrong,jezabel s i think you are from costa lol,you work in starbucks you are in no position to give advice on coffee lol,if you make the milk first then press 1 or 2 cup button so it flash and the steam light go out you can use the frother to clean the plastic froth tube removable this sort the coffee compartment so you can instantly use coffee,sandra kawaii can you make a tutorial video d,very detailed video thank you,very helpfull kiss from romania,big corey from the uk waiting for ya,ai aceast masina de cafea esti mul umit spune mi mai multe detalii daca il ai mersi,i have noticed that when i use steam first then i switch it off to brew coffee boiler warming up forever i am deciding then to turn it off and on again to warm really quick it is strange because it supposed to have two boiler other way work fine coffe then milk then turn off,marcin it is actually cooling down after steaming all you have to do to speed up the process is immediately after steaming press the steam button or one of the coffee button so that both coffee button flash then open the steam hot water tap and let some steam and hot water out for about five second until the button stop flashing voila ready to make coffee again,thank you so much i have had my machine over three year now and you have just shown me where the ground coffee go i thought it wa a bean only machine,i bought it today and this is the best manual i have found thanks a lot,in coffeeshops the crema is a little different it thiker and ha another colour,nice review thank you,i have the same machine make an acceptable cup of coffee when using the strongest bean and set to produce the strongest coffee though the coffee is nothing to write home about being not particularly hot and not particularly strong however the really poor aspect of the machine is it design with respect to cleaning it really seems to have been designed to make it cleaning a difficult a possible some of the used ground fall outside the removable container into which they are supposed to fall so the inside of the machine which is full of nook and cranny becomes very dirty the ground container itself is designed not to be easily cleaned and the drip tray is a total disaster of design seemingly made to be a difficult a possible to clean and then to dry not recommended,hi nice demo thanks im thinking of using this in my shop please can you tell me exactly how long a break doe it need between cup to cool and how much approx doe it cost per 1 medium cup of americano your answer would really help my decision cheer,can i make hot chocolat,im lost can i make a coffee just with only ground coffee already a i try and sometimes doe not work,for me the machine it is really about bean a you have found sometimes with ground coffee it doe not work max 1 spoon of ground coffee per time what if you want 6 cup for 6 people,change the battery in your smoke detector,sporter470 it is changed now sorry if it annoyed you,brilliant video very informative,useful to watch prior to purchase one thing that doe put me off is that i seek the traditional scream of milk scolded with a proper espresso machine is steam wand i also note that in this video clip the wand is neither wiped after use nor purged prior to being placed in the jug of milk if one is spending so much money on a top of the line coffee machine it is worth taking the trouble to find out how to correctly steam milk for coffee that require it i understand from a barista that some will use a thermometer to ensure the right uniform milk temperature while others judge it is correct when the jug is too hold to hold such video a this would be even better if updated after a few month of experience is gained,you should purge the steamer a little bit to get rid of water,ur review is pretty awesome and clear thx i just wan na know how to make my espresso taste stronger with le water,fai c turn your bean quantity knob fully clockwise and grind more finely,nice geordie accent a well,i just bought one of these it is great if you read the instruction you will find it straight forward to use,canny video like pet i wa pleasantly surprised to hear your fellow accent n that spot ern vid ive been looking into this one n it look lush cheeaazz x,hi my cup warmer on top never actually get hot to warm the cup should it is there a button sequence to press to get this to work thanks great review,gerard brady a far a i know this machine us a single boiler so will take a while to hear up the cup warmer some high end machine are dual boiler you can steam and pull a shot at the same time and these machine heat up the warming plate a lot faster a single unit is a passive warming plate hope this help,gerard brady i am sorry i have never really used the cup warmer much on mine a a warm cup is not such an issue with cappuccino which is what i drink most ours get warm but only when switched on for a while sorry i can not be of more help,doe it have a taste of plastic those coffee machine under gbp500 tend to have lot of plastic part inside unfortunately,lolekbezbolkashow i have never noticed a taste of plastic from mine so far,where to buy a tablet for discaling or cleaning this machine thanks,benjie caigoy you can bit descaling kit form the delonghi machine on

comment i have read on youtube,argh i got caught too even changed the battery very good video btw i am getting mine now,just got done wandering around my house looking for the bad detector then read the comment glad i am not crazy nice review thank you,ryan cummings haha wa thinking the same thing wonder if i have got any of them square battery lying round,me too,how much wa it then,hi lauren thanks for the video is the machine still working ok and are you still happy with it is performance regard,blogger mummy lauren thanks for your reply lauren i am going to finish my stock of pod off then get one of these thanks once again,blogger mummy lauren thanks for your reply lauren very helpful video people such a yourself are a godsend to people that need genuine user review,richard aldridge hello richard yes machine is still working perfectly and i am very happy with it it is a good machine,will it do just hot water,yes liam if you turn the steam wand dial without pressing the steam button first hot water should dispense from the wand,i have just bought one of these and you can adjust how hot you want you coffee to come out which is great it seems that you can adjust just about everything on this machine child also love a hot chocolate which is easy to made with the steam attachment the only thing i would like them to change is the amount of coffee bean you can load thanks for posting such a detail video i had one in the past an i did find the coffee could be hotter but this one is great,savage savage you have to press and hold the 1cup button for 5 sec adjust with 2cup button then finish with 1cup again the light signify the heat setting,is it working properly till now any problem,maleka58 where can you adjust the temperature of the coffee,i have the corso one the milk frothing is not hot enough but froth very quickly how is yours is it how suppose to be or there is something wrong with mine,lisa lily hi lisa on this one the milk froth up quickly but it doe take a bit longer to heat up once you have got a good froth submerge the wand in to the milk and leave it there for a while to heat the milk up a bit once your milk jug is almost too hot to touch it is generally ready might be worth buying a thermometer that you can leave in the jug which will tell you when it is hot enough hope that help,i have just been out to the kitchen 3 time to clear the fault log in our yale alarm,your alarm is beeping how can i trust your review if you can not even replace 9v battery in your alarm,matityah perhaps my alarm only started beeping the morning of the review i can assure you the battery ha since been replaced thanks for your comment,loved the review,thanks chris i appreciate your kind word,just to let first time user know that you have to make 3 cup before you get a decent flow until then it tends to drip i thought it wa due to me having the bean grinder setting too fine but i think it wa just sorting itself out give it a few cup and it should be fine,the manual will tell you this exact thing if you bother to read it,thanks for a great review lauren just had mine delivered today and judging by your setting i think i made my first cup way too strong a i had the cup size all the way to the right and it nearly took my head off how do you make an americano,perfect i will give it a try thanks again x,darren altman hi darren i am glad you like the review honestly it took a little playing around with the machine to get the strength to my preference for a true americano dispense some hot water in to your cup from the wand if you use the wand without pressing the steam button it dispenses hot water and then put it under the coffee spout and add a shot of strong coffee for a long coffee we tend to put strength to around half and cup size to max and press 1 or 2 cup depending on the mug size hope that help
6,today would you buy this model again or would you rather buy philip 4300,i honestly have not liked any of the philip i have had they are ok but the espresso quality just doe not match the delonghi in my experience i have used older philip and the newer 2200 and 3300 and have not been impressed if you want something that doe auto frothing go with the higher end delonghi or the terra kaffee bang for buck,i have a dark roast coffee that i absolutely love but it is oily doe this delonghi have a bypass for pre ground coffee i am just now starting to research coffee maker we have had a philip saeco italia for about 15 year that finally bit the dust and it seems like a lot of people say do not use oily bean is that true for every coffee maker out there or do i need to go to a semi automatic like i said i am new to this maybe the oily bean is what finally made the italia die,semi automatic would be better since you could get a grinder that can handle oily bean but the delonghi doe have a by pas,also the temperature is at 4 red light on,joe varacalli at the manual i read when the machine is on behind there is a button on position i then on front if you press and hold the one cup button on the buttom you see red light thisis the temperature of hot water in scale from 1 red light to 4 red light in which you have set your machine check the manual if you wish,sorry it is been awhile since i watched this video can you elaborate a bit more or tell me when in the video this is referring to,whats the grinder setting ihave it at 2 or between 2 and 1 from 3 and above i think it very coarse and the coffee come watery,yeah we go between 2 and 1 5 some time corser like 2 5 if we are just making coffee,would you still recommend the stumptown holler mtn for this unit,joe varacalli ty,alex yeah there is a coffee amount dial turn it to the max and then hit the brew button a second time when that time you are shooting for happens,joe varacalli i will try that thank you how do you keep it going longer i hit the two cup button and wait until it is done can i adjust that time,alex how old our your bean check the roast date make sure it is atleast 7 day out and may need ten day from roast date next i keep the coffee ground amount to the max and try and go a fine a possible this will maximize extraction and lower the chance of underextracting sour next run the shot alittle longer from the point of first drip shoot for maybe 25 to 35 second let me know if that help,joe varacalli what is your setting on this machine with stumptown so that the taste is not sour i have tried adjusting the setting and still can not get the sour taste out i set the grind to 1 and both knob in the middle to mask the sourness if i turn the knob to a 3 the sour taste intensifies wanted to see what you are doing,the infuser can not be removed while the machine is on that is why it would not come out,you are correct figured that one out after lol,i have the same machine now 9 year and today she died and now i have dilema lol because i really do not know what machine should i buy,ohhh my god let me help you out you can always buy the same machine i still think it is very good are you still wanting a super automatic,i found one of these on craigslist for dollar200 with an included extra infuser i also found a gaggia brera for dollar290 but it is only a year old i really like strong coffee and espresso unfortunately i can not afford a true manual espresso set if you just wanted a machine to make strong americano style drink and a machine that not hard or expensive to maintain would you choose the older magnifica 3300 for dollar200 or the year old gaggia brera for dollar290,joe varacalli thanks unfortunately it sold,i would go with the delonghi i still think this machine is the best super automatic in term of strong espresso,just got one of thee machine joe what are the dial setting for water coffee you tend to use i have mine dialed in for a single shot but i have heard all the double button doe is double the water since my coffee setting is about 3 4 of the way up it feel like i would get too much water instead of a real double shot,rob stevens sorry idk why the link did not post the first time this is my list of best coffee i have reviewed,rob stevens this is my current list of best coffee bean they are all pretty good the only one i would not go crazy for is starbucks blonde roast it is hit or miss super crema is actually very good in term of coffee quality,i appreciate the reply i landed on 2 5 for the grind setting with my current setting sound like i should play around a bit more started with lavazza super crema got a great deal but any other coffee you recommend for this machine,yeah i keep the ground coffee amount cranked all the way up the water volume i typically keep half way up and just manually stop brewing at around 2oz the best way to get a dial in on a super automatic is to just use time and volume since you can not really weigh anything so shoot for 2oz out in about 20 to 27 second at first drip honestly it is hard to over extract in this machine generally speaking since it us a pressurized filter basket generally my grind size is at 2 or 3,you can pull the brew unit out but the machine must be turned off first,yeah i realized that a i wa recording lol it is a great feature to be able to clean the brew unit,thanks for the good review i owned a similar model for 10 12 year had it repaired once or twice but used it numerous time over that period for the price absolutely no complaint make a good quality coffee,yeah they make a couple similar product and gaggia make something called the brera which is almost identical i moved on to a semi automatic which is much more of a pain but the end product is just a bit better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,every 15 cup i need to stand one hour and do this waiting until this process end nightmare better to go to starbucks and buy coffey,i have done the descaling procedure and the red light is still flashing i desperately need coffee help,i press the descale light all ok turn the knob then nothing happens i have turned the machine off and on several time but the descale programme will not start when the machine go off and then on steam doe come out with a little water a usual it is just the descale process will not work any idea please,very huge kudos for you josh shire you are absolutely right they missed that part both here in that video and in the original instruction from delonghi and guess what guy when the process start and and stop for longer period of time i though something happened and that is why and i have power off the machine and cancel the cycle and now could not start it again i dig in internet but no where there is an instruction how to restart the process and the worst thing is that it made the first process but it stopped on the rinse process so i could not use it now because it is not rinsed from the descale agent i am afraid to use it like this and can not enjoy my lovely coffee please help guy because delonghi are not very helpful any suggestion guy,i would just start it all over again hold down the rinse button the one that wa flashing before until it is a solid red this time just use normal water no descaler and turn the steam dial all the way and let it do it is thing if for any reason that doe not work if the steam nozzle will not pull water through etc then i would take all the bean out and have the machine make a bunch of long coffee until you have emptied the water container your goal is to just make sure there is no descaler chemical left in the process of making a normal cup so that should do the trick good luck,same i have had mine year also but every year i am back on this site,use lemon juice instead of the cleaning solution to descale,hi all doe anyone here know how to solve the problem of the magnifica making weak americanos with bean my machine may have a channeling issue read about it online ha anyone taken apart the inner part to clean service them to improve coffee strength also it is not a fine course bean adjuster issue i have tried that both way thanks in advance,i have got the same issue i just use a smaller mug,keith i rely on this video also a handbook mislaid along time ago,doe anything ever work like it is supposed to with these machine,one would think that a coffee maker this expensive would last more than a year without major failure requiring repair when far le expensive coffee maker costing 10percent a much can last for year this brand make an average cup of whatever is made and damn sure not worth the cost and expense,please upgrade this video it is not accurate a we followed the video our machine ha never been descaled i think you owe u about 10 descalings,same here,same here,glad this exists the manual explanation how to do this is rubbish,2 year and still need the video,thank you,i accidentally did a short press and triggered the normal rinsing cycle with the descale in the water tank is that going to cause an issue,i have had this machine for over 6 year and every time descaling is needed i have to watch this video a i do not remember how it is done thanks for uploading it,i have the same problem,same lol,same here,ditto,same,thanks for a good video but i have a question should we emptying the tank of coffee before we starting that,you can leave the coffee bean it just us the steamer nozzle so will not grind any coffee,one of these day i will remember how to do it without the video,thank you,i had the issue where the process would not start light flashing steam valve opened but then nothing i left the machine in that state for about 15 minute and the machine powered itself off same a if you leave machine on after making a drink once off i powered back on and pressed the descale button light flashing a per video then reopened the milk frother but quicker than previously rather than move it slowly a i did before and the descale process ha started this time no idea if machine reset itself after it powered off or by opening the milk valve quickly ha resolved issue but hope this could help others,ive descaled a on the video and the light is still on what do i do,for those that wonder why it suddenly stop do not do anything yet give it some time and it will continue it is letting the descaling fluid clean the internals before flushing it out wait until the watertank is empty and the light are flashing you can use the flushed out water in your hot kettle so it descales a well tip i got from some comment in here thought i would summarize,it is that time of month again,we are all together on this one brother,this machine is a pain it always asking me to descale it i live in a soft water area and have only ever descaled my kettle and iron once in a year this thing is asking me to descale it every month on top of that be aware this only descales the steamer not the working for the actual coffee do not expect your coffee to taste any better afterwards,change the water hardness setting,one massively important point they miss out in the video is that it will not be a continuous 15 minute cleaning process it will keep cycling through so be patient and leave your pan or container there kind of dumb they left that part out,alicia yes finally i find the way to just rince the machine with frah water and i have done 2 3 full tnaks with water and now i am enjoying again a freshly brew coffee in the morning thnank for you help,stefan kostadinov hmmm you could always do one bad coffee then the next one will be fine or try and descale it again but with just water,alicia hello alisa yes i might stop descaling it bu my problem is that is stopped in the middle of the process and i could not rince the machine and could not find a way to restart the process and i can not use it now because it is not rinced aftwr the cleaning any suggestion,stefan kostadinov you know what i have learnt since this comment i do not even descale my machine anymore and it ha not broken and it is been about a year i do not use the milk froth i also live in a hard water area i think descaling is a waste of money,alicia same think here alicia and how did you continue restart the process after that,the total and interval time are underestimated a lot but it work if you overlook that,yes agreed,my machine seems to need descaling every 2 week,there is a setting to tell the machine how hard your water is,you must live in hertfordshire too,hakuna matata,process start then the top three light go off and nothing,minarchist 412 yeah turn out i wa just impatient lol,did you turn on fully open the stream value,why doe not the water go through the coffee nozzle and only through the steam nozzle it seems like descaling should happen through the coffee nozzle since i rarely use the steam function,i wa told that if i buy bottled water i would not need to descale six month later i find myself having to descale i am guessing it is because when i clean the infuser i soak it in tap water,demineralized water will create le scale tap water is full of mineral that cause scale not bottled water it is the same a tap,good for delonghi for uploading this video i can never remember how to do it,yeah true tat i can never remember it too it is not tat simple,it took me about three year of descaling before i could remember it,some excellent further instruction here,excellent video worked perfectly for me thank you,thank you,when i hold the red light down for 5 second all the other light turn off what and the descaling is not happening what should i do,this happens on mine too but the programme completes a described just be patient i have thought that nothing wa happening too but it doe a long a you open the steam dial,what should i do if descaling is not starting after holding the button for 5 second it is lighting red and that is it,what is the cappuccino asker my dear l am not sure,have you opened the cappuccino asker on i did not at first,gift box fuck off you charged me through the nose for it,worked perfectly for me and a far a i am concerned of course you would have the machine switched on,stupid video the water stop on only 10 second and the red lamp is lightning,thank you sooo much,no do not use tap water,everything else is straight forward except the video failed to mention once machine stop running with red light on stead and do not do anything and let it run through till the tank is empty i thought it wa non stop till tank is empty not sure if anything went wrong so i started the machine again of course the descale solution went through coffee output now i am worried,one thing that is missing ist to turn the mashine on before putting in the water because if not it will pump the acid through the usual coffe output i do not know if thats a problem but it might be,i actually prefer it that way a my coffee output dispenser get clogged too and i let the descale solution run through that when i turn on the machine when i next go to make coffee i just run the rinse cycle a time or two,damn it,yes run load of water through it on the pu side least the coffe output is then clean,where to get descale agent,i just bought a load of food grade citric acid powder work well,bugger i have just replaced this one with a 5400 and i can not find a descale video,my one still red light too,interestingly neither the manual nor the video show how much water to add to the 100ml of descaler fluid the manual make no reference at all to it and the video suggests you fill it somewhere towards the maximum mark but not actually up to the maximum mark it would be nice to have something a little more precise,you can see the water in the see throw tank hello open your eye,the video say to fill the tank after putting the descaler in,usually if no amount is given you should work on 1 litre that is what the descaling liquid guide told me,you fill the water tank to the top a it will need most of that to wash through the machine,na und alles klar danke,my red light still on it is not a straightforward a you show any help,just wait it will pause for a few minute rinse some more and repeat until tank empty do not wait once the water ha run out or you will need to start all over again a it auto power off,my machine leak a lot of water during descaling i think only during descaling not while using the machine what can i do,oh and agree with buttermilk be patient once you have opened steam valve machine doe about a 5 purge then sits idle for about 5 min before another purge this is normal so do not touch anything it is letting thing soak descale a an added tip once your coffee machine ha finished empty your waste descale solution container into your kettle for a free descale for a few min then rinse,would be really useful if they mentioned this in the video,great i thought something wa wrong with it and turned the steam dial off and on again doh,thank you i did not know there would be a 5 min pause after the first purge actually there were multiple purge pause iteration i thought something wa wrong with the machine but it is part of the process so if nothing happens for a while it is ok just wait and do not touch it,oh bollock,what a brilliant idea thansk,a lot easier to follow than the manual good video thanks,i did not have the top light flash but the red descaling did stop flashing so i began the descaling process by adding the chemical sold cheaper at bed bath and beyond and fresh cold water to tank it take 15 minute and it will go through a few cycle a if it is in a soak so be patient and let it do it thing walk away after tank empty repeat,clean twice but the red light still on what is the problem,i also had this problem thought the machine had gone wrong although it worked ok the descaling light wa on i did another descale with the manual in front of me and you must do exactly a it say daniel is correct it is all to do with the steam knob also this video doe not mention washing tank before filling to flush fail to do this and your coffee will not taste good,antonio di bartolomeo i have a same problem,i have same problem what did you do,very helpful and simple to follow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,odli an aparat super kafa odli an kapucino takodjer,thanks a always you do the best machine review,thank you for this great post hey i have difficulty using ready ground coffee on this machine any video on that one,great personality and great review super straight to the point and helpful,buy a gaggia,you are an absolute legend at reviewing thank you,gail please just tell me which super automatic espresso maker to buy budget dollar1000 so tired of shopping for it lol,well done thanks,great video thanks,do you have any recommendation of different setting for the knob for different size strength,that seemed to take a long time to make the coffee i like my delonghi 860,when you made a coffee you said it had three choice from small to medium and large cup all brewed with same amount of coffee bean but different liquid amount so when we do a large cup do we get an americano since it pours extra water and espresso when we do small cup size im i getting right,kind of and americano would be a standard shot with hot water added this is pushing more water through the espresso a longer pull possibly over extracting sorry this is a year late the end result would end up being similar but different,doe anyone know if this ha an auto tamp going on after it grind the coffee it is all internal so it is a curiosity,yes i have a similar machine not this model but a similar delonghi and yes when you auto grind it grind the quantity of bean you have asked for drop the ground into the next part internally then automatically tamp to the required pressure inside then you get automatically a pre infusion then the coffee come out into your cup or glass these delonghi machine are fantastic and make lovely drink,great video bought this machine yesterday and wa waiting forever to make coffee after steaming milk wa wondering why now youve confirmed that the temperature needed to be cooler seems like i wa waiting for this to happen will use the water function to bring temp down after steaming thank you,i received mine yesterday but it show no water light did you have any problem setting it up i can not find any way to contact the company put water into tank made sure it wa inserted properly but it still show red light,filtered water delonghi webpage say to avoid demineralized water reverse osmosis the more i read about my delonghi the more i see to use tap water,you did not explain the two button on the right in the bottom row,is there a machine that ha a milk frother that can do both a lot of foam and micro foam and lot of it for latte art i am looking at both delonghi and breville in the dollar500 dollar600 range thanks,gaggia,if you are still looking breville barista express bes870xl,how do i get 1 shot of espresso from this machine,machine make absolutely great coffee quality is not to bad but not to great either the infuser on my machine ha been jammed several time and it and had to send it back to the factory for them to fix it i use it a lot 15 20 cup a day and it hold up quite well for the past 1 5 year no major flaw on it besides the infuser that they fixed perfectly well quick and for free including shipping and no minor bug breakage great machine for the price,well it is not a lot of water need to be bigger,great video great camera review keep em coming,what would you say the difference are between this one and the 3300 besides the fact the 04110 is newer i can not tell by reading the info on both the machine,i also would like to know if this 04110 machine take the exact same infuser brew unit a the 3300 since i have a spare one from the 3300 but now considering to purchase the 04110,great review,howdy i just came to this new video to see if ur still terrible at latte art and guess what im here to share what clicked with me tilt the cup then start tilting back to up right a you want the white of the milk to expose it self but u got ta pause and let the swirling stop before you do the final pours,hi gail love your vids very to the point i have just started getting into espresso and now i need a machine i am debating either getting the delonghi ec 156 or the ec 685 which one is the best thanks,we love you too gail,9 42 for me the milk get too hot to hold somewhere around 110 120 so i leave it frothing a little more since it should be 140 great video,please show the metric weight on screen,1 liquid ounce 30ml and there fit about 225gram of coffeebeans in out of experience,first u need to put a man on the moon then your opinion will matter just kidding p,why do not you ever give retail price,jamie h retail slick it give you a base,there is a link to the machine in the description for you to check the price,holy shit that took forever,first comment,nice machine how much it is,700dollar,how doe it match up to miele quality wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,everything i hoped it would be i love the simplicity of this keurig mybest kitchen i have had the old school original keurig for forever i decided to upgrade to button lol same great quality without having to measure your water this keurig doe all the thinking for you i also love not having to put water into the machine every time i want to use it simple and perfect,bloody hell how is this machine still being sold when this video is 12 year old power consuption seems crazy high the only thing that seems good with this machine is that you can use ground coffee a well a bean,limetree we aim to please if i were you though i would go for a grinder and a v60 dripper,documentally i am glad i found your video mate a i wa looking at buying this machine until i saw how old this model is and how power efficient it is compared to today standard i settled for a melitta bean to cup in the end thank you for your video from 12 year ago haha,i also can not believe that this machine is still being sold i doubt it is this video that ha been propping up sale for the last 12 year,just bought this machine and already i have regretted it the amount of electricity it us is ridiculous despite my bean claiming so there is very little crema and when i try to use the option for preground coffee it just fall straight through meaning i have to take everything out clean it them get the vac in there to clean up the coffee for the price i am extremely underwhelmed with this machine,return it this machine is over 12 year old i am shocked it is still even for sale i am buying the melitta avanza 600 series,is this machine still even made have you got old stock i made this video over nine year ago and would probably invest my money elsewhere if i wa looking for a state of the art coffee machine personally i only use a v 60 dripper and are porlex grinder nowadays,thanks for amazing video i just bought this coffee machine,do you buy all your tech 10 year out of date,vid o en fran ai svp merci,wow that thing is noisy a hell can not imagine using it at 4 30 in the morning i wa planing to buy it but now i do not know,wow the amount of electricity this waste is just amazing it make me want putting my homemade automatic coffee machine on kickstarter or just make some for review people the problem is that it is 3750w power consumption is too high for a uk plug 750 of those watt are just the grinder,this machine is still being sold in 2020 almost gbp220 now in amazon cyber weekend deal i may need to send it back a i can not get it to work light up like a christmas tree and nothing happening,just brought one on amazon for gbp270,vaidotas lipskas thanks for replying unfortunately i had to return it a it had a serious defect ie the defuser wa not motoring into position i bought a sage machine instead and it far superior machine mostly all stainless steel and work effortlessly with very hot espresso etc,it took me a while but that cappucino maker on the right side ha to be turn to the left side completely and you have to turn off cappucino to right side completely after that just wait until it stop flashing and it should work just fine i hope it make sense d,ne pa commercialiser en france puisque aucune explication en francais je vais donc choisir krups,just got mine well happy thanks for the review i got mine here,great review thanks,9 year how old is this machine,mohammed aqeeli thats what i wa thinking guess it a proven design lol,how do i get 1 shot of espresso from this machine,how to start use it and adjust the setting i can not to know how it work at first time,i bought a easm4200 due to review like this on youtube my 4200 take 14 minute to make cappuccino apparently according to delonghi this is right now the thing with this is after you have frothed the milk with the steam wand it take 8 minute to heat water to make the coffee itself by which time the frothy milk isnt really frothy so you end up with a flat white but a little thicker if you wish to make 4 coffee one of which requires frothed milk you can say good bye to 20 min also do not use delonghis online web form for support after waiting a fortnight i phoned and initially after waiting 3 min they picked the phone up them promptly put it down when i phoned again after waiting for nearly a long they said do not use the form email u 4 week now and they answered saying it take this amount of time to make a frothy cappuccino really 14 minute for an angry flat white im an honest opinion do not buy this unit if you want a cappuccino for expressos and longs it work anything else do not,did you actually read the instruction i can only assume not and if you use that thing called common sense you would know that if you make the coffer first then steam the milk you will not be waiting 14 minute,wow this is a really old review now i would not go buying a coffee machine this old in fact my opinion is do not buy a coffee machine at all get yourself a v 60 dripper and keep thing simple if you really want a decent cappuccino then you will need to invest personally i think coffee should be drunk black so that you can taste it,no way i will select a cup of coffee with so much water,that coffee looked a weak a piss pas,sold,oh my god the noise from the machine the neighbour are complaining,half of that cup is water i do believe is more suitable for an espresso small cup,really magnifica,ur chill af bruv cut out all that bollock eh,tropico 5 song,great vid n funny too,i am using it for 4 or 5 year so far no issue at all still working a it the 1st day,i am having problem with this i can get it working with bean the coffee drip out rather than pours but i can not make it work with ground coffee nothing come out and i just get a round lump of wet coffee in the machine,peter bergman read the instruction properly,just bought one for gbp230 56 on amazon uk a of july 2016 coming to the end of it is product life i am guessing,nope gbp290 on amazon today,is it possible to make a flat white with this machine and i mean a proper flat white with the fancy pattern i have tried a dozen time but fail lol,yes,blimey ive gone deaf,ours ha been working great for 3 yr then suddenly a clacking sound amp it can not grind the bean amp produce nothing anyone had this problem or ha this hi tech machine died already thanks for any help,when you say there is a pouch for the powder is that for the instant coffee,wilson18 lol i figured it out in the end definitely ground coffee,this is probably too late but it wont be instant coffee it would be ground coffee d,documentally lol fare enough because of this video i asked the wife to get me this exact machine for xmas loving it trying to teach myself to make a flat white,halochamppp i think so this wa over 6 year ago now,is there an equivalent one that is manual,gbp279 in amazon i agree with review this machine delivers excellent coffee will take a few week to fine tune it to your taste in the final analysis coffee you get will depends on bean type,do the people in cuba have access to all these wonderful product you review i mean of course besides the castro is and their muscle men like the late che guevara ahhh what is the big deal it is just a symbol right it doe seem odd you reviewing all these wonderful high tech product next to picture of a man who ha caused the suffering of so many people people who have no access to any of the product you review and do not even have the ability to watch your video because of men like che guevara but it is a wonderful thing to live in a free and democratic country to have the money to buy all the newest advance in technology it seems that you are enjoying your life and that is all that really matter is not it,well done just the review i needed,the turning knob at the front are the left for how much water ie half cup etc and the right is for strengh you got it the other way round but all said and done a smashing machine,i am so stupid

11,i bought one for my parent around 15 year ago they still using it,hi benito thanks fort sharing your parent is experience,is it possible to make latte art out of this machine and how to achieve,hi st thanks for the question it is possible but very difficult the auto frothing wand produce a coarser milk foam one will have more success with a manual steaming wand capable of producing a super fine micro foam if looking for a bean to cup machine with a manual wand check the gaggia cadorna barista plus here is a video with the machine in action frothing for and pouring latte art hope that help marc,my machine like yours is super fast to go from coffee brewing to steaming however if i try to go from steaming back to brewing the light will pulse forever and will end up having to restart the machine any advise thank you,hey thanks guy i have one for christmas and im using it for first time following the manual of course but is always good to have all this info,hey 1000 you are welcome the more you know,why do you keep calling it coffee i thought i wa buying an espresso machine also i feel like my coffee is luke warm and even on smaller setting of eapresso not very strong what can i do for both these issue any help would be appreciated,hi nicole sorry for the confusion it is an espresso machine which can also make a long coffee coffee and espresso are often used interchangeably for instance in italy if you have a coffee it is always an espresso filter drip coffee doe not really exist in italy italian manufacturer of espresso machine usually refer to them a espresso coffee machine for stronger espresso turn the machine is strength setting up to max more important set the grinder to it finest grind setting when making espresso set cup volume to produce 1oz 30ml or le for warmer in cup temp leave your serving cup on the cup warmer on top right of machine hope this help marc,,hi hh if in u here outside u fiond a dealer here,you guy are awesome and very thorough,hi barb thanks a whole latte for the comment,house sitting with this machine and i did all you said except for descale and the frother is still spitting out milk not frothing descale light is not on but i would descale just to try that however what is the solution you mentioned i have a 30 year old krups machine that i rinse through with some white vinegar and water every once in awhile unless i can get this baby to froth all the bell and whistle are worthless my 30 year old krups espresso maker is super simple to use i have to add the water each time and put the ground espresso into the holder myself but it is simple and work great any other tip for cleaning that frother by the way your direction are really nice and straight forward thank you,hi becky poor froth is typically caused by dirty component in the milk frothing device here is a link to the machine is manual most common problem is blockage of the air intake hole on the outer sleeve of the frothing device it is shown in figure 27 on page 14 of the linked manual cleaning any blockage there a well a general cleaning of the frothing device a described in the manual should restore your frothing performance hope that help marc,i have a magnifica 3400 it one of the worst coffee machine i have ever had totally outdated technology and overpriced garbage,i do not like the voice tik tik bom bom when you use the steamer is there another choice,doe this machine have any plastic part through which hot water would pas,hi richard there are plastic part which water come in contact with,the noise really ha become quite nice to me it sound like the morning lol but i have kid so anyway my friend think it is amazing usually a good indication of how cool something is is how your friend react it wa a gift from my father he is an amazing guy but this is by far the greatest thing he is ever done for me and i wa adopted,good video,my machine stopped pulling water from the tank this happened over the course of 2 day i replaced the water pump the flowmeter o ring diffuser cleaned internally and lubricated everything could it be the in line filter just after the water tank i am soaking the tube in hot water with a little clr today but they do not appear clogged what else could it be when i watch it with the side off water is not pulling through the tube also the machine now make a higher pitched noise when trying to run coffee is being ground and pressed it appears to be just a water issue no leak idea,i only use filtered water so it is not a descaling issue everything is smooth a silk however i found that when i replaced the flow meter it did not want to kick in i had to bypass the filter and pull out the flow meter to allow the tube to straighten out i also unplugged the circuit and plugged them back in a couple time i soaked all the tubing i also removed the top which may have freed up a kink somewhere eventually it started working i do not know exactly what the solution wa but apparently enough part and messing with the tubing worked,hi nikki sorry for the delayed response just back from visiting manufacturer in italy one common cause is scale formation in the boiler i can not be certain that is the problem in your case but it is a possibility especially if you have hard water and did not treat filter the water to remove excess mineral or neglected to descale the machine a recommended by delonghi,can someone tell me if it is possible to do latte art with this machine thank you,hi ola lola this machine us an auto frothing wand the froth quality produced by that type of wand is generally not fine enough for pouring latte art you need a machine with a manual wand some skill required to get that froth quality if you prefer super automatic bean to cupm achines with built in grinder the gaggia babila and gaggia accademia have manual frothing wand in addition to carafe based automatic frothing gaggia accademia gaggia babila another option are 2 newer machine from breville the barista touch and oracle touch are semi automatic machine with built in grinder you grind into a portafilter so they are not bean to cup these machine have incredible automatic frothing with adjustable froth density and temperature at fine setting they produce a milk froth which is capable of latte art you can see the breville oracle touch in action and pouring latte art here,hi guy i wa wondering is there a way to regulate the water temperature for the espresso brew,hi sda thanks for the question i do not have a machine in front of me but manual state there are 4 temperature setting,can anyone estimate the temperature of the coffee a brewed love the 3300 we have had it for a couple of year,hi can you tell me why my esam 3200s is doing this please,hi i purchased this machine recently and really love it is there a way to add a water filter to this i do not think the water tank is designed for one but how about if it just floated in the tank,no problem it is what we do,you are awesome thank you for replying back to me,hi guy i do not have one in front of me to check if it can accept a typical plug in tank filter a quick check of the machine manual make no mention of a water filter in that case a free floating filter is a good option here is a free floating pad filter we recommend,thanks for the helpful video did you guy ever come across the issue of not being able to create steam my steamer never switch from spouting hot water to the dual thermal steam hoping it is not broken a it is brand new,i just received mine from amazon and i am having the same problem luckily i have a milk steamer that i can use,hi sue happy to hear delonghi wa able to help you out doa happens on rare occasion but good they are backing up the product i have unboxed and used at least 50 delonghi machine and never had a problem sometimes machine get shocked in shipping causing an issue,just worked with delonghi tech to troubleshoot and they recommended returning and replacing asap already in work hopefully next one is not a dud love the coffee espresso,i just got it off amazon a xmas gift that i hope to have all set up and working by then did not expect to have to trouble shoot this much i have tried what you suggested with no luck the machine sound labored but measured and only drip of water come out hot water feature is fine just no steam when expected,hi sue you are welcome so your machine continuously pump water when you turn the steam on be sure you have not pressed the hot water button before turning the steam dial the light above the hot water button should not be illuminated when you want to steam milk also turn the steam dial and purge the wand of water then turn the dial back to off then back on to start steaming if the hot water light is off and the machine never produce steam then there may be an issue where did you purchase the machine,any idea how to clear the general alarm after the brew unit wasnt pushed in correctly it hit the ceiling i got into engineer mode everything work i can move the unti electronically etc but the general alarm remains last time they just replaced the system board for gbp170,pete thompson hi pete sorry i can not be of more help i would contact delonghi support if you have not already delonghi is one of the few brand we do not service,hi yep i have got into engineer mode but pressing down two button on power up it is almost like it need a reset the brew unit move up and down in engineer mode on demand it just miranda of general alarm,have you tried power cycling the machine turn off and

problem with short esspresso when it start to leak it take 4 5 and coffe dose not have some special taste i tried with different setup for gridner but it doe not give me some special result please can you help me what can be problem,i used this coffe caff vergnano gran aroma i think that this beanse are with oil surface and i always use highest strength setting i expect a thick coffee but it is very thin the coffe ha a great cream,hi benjamin taste usually come down to the coffee bean used what sort of special taste are you after what coffee are you using now in general for espresso on super auto machine we suggest highest dose strength setting and a finer grind unless using very dark roast or bean with oily surface,is this the me10 i can not see the name the book say that it is the me10,sarah forever you are very welcome,whole latte love thank you so much,sarah forever the me 10 may be an older version of the magnifica line use this link to current magnifica model,i would like to ask about the different of the model esam 2800 3300 4200 and which of them is the latest model not to compare with those have touch screen thanks,alan lim heng loong here is a link to the most recent delonghi magnifica we no longer carry the 2800 3300 4200 they are older model,hey guy i love your video and watch a lot even about the one i can never own ha i recently decided to buy one of those 3300 is second hand having had a delonghi ec 320 for year and getting decent crema i can only seem to get drip like coffee with a thin straw coloured layer of foam out of this one no matter what type of bean avoiding oily of course i use no matter what setting combination is this everything this machine can achieve perhaps it is broken or need an overhaul tune up best v,nice work bro can not wait to buy one,mine is loud too good to see some people using it right my crema is not great but okay,hey guy i am glad to hear your machine make a much noise a ours i almost thought there wa a problem with this delonghi magnifica 3300 i guess not we enjoy the coffee it make,my machine like yours is super fast to go from coffee brewing to steaming however if i try to go from steaming back to brewing the light will pulse forever and will end up having to restart the machine any advise thank you,the coffee quality is indeed great bought from the only misgiving i would have about using it are that the knob have no user marking which mean that if there are several people in the house using the machine it is impossible to select the previously selected individual setting also the time before the machine performs an auto switchoff is fixed at about three hour i could not find the power comsumption in the user manual when in idle mode but i think it must be substantial since it keep the boiler cup preheater hot during this time not that the preheater is any use i warm my cup by first wetting them and then putting them in the microwave for 30 second,nice work guy,thank you very much i could not figure out how to open the water reservoir i thought you open it like a door,a very helpful video in my process of choosing a machine thank you very much,very useful info thx guy,thanks for your helpful comment it seems like the machine go through a lot of cleaning cycle which can be good but is it annoying it doe seem like a ton of water a mikearman mentioned thought,the saeco royal coffee bar is by far more suited for cafe environment than the magnifica x the jura capresso xs90 is another great machine for your need our espresso expert would be happy to help with any additional question 1 888 411 5282 option 1 please also consult local law about nsf approval before making your purchasing decision,i wa hoping you could give a recommendation im opening a small restaurant coffee is not it main product so a dollar3k dollar6k machine would be out of the question but i would still like to offer a quality espresso or cappuccino we are guessing that three time a day we would have a rush of 10 beverage what would be a good machine that will handle that quantity day after day should i be looking at more professional machine than the delonghi ecam22110sb magnifica x thank you for any help,wow this is asome,the 3300 is no longer available by delonghi for a newer version check out the ecam22110sb magnifica x by clicking the link in the video description this machine make coffee espresso and ha a steam wand for frothing milk to make cappuccino is and latte,hi is this machine for coffee only or also for tea and hot chocolate and cappuccin or there is other machine foe this work and 3300 for coffee only,the machine will run through a cleaning cycle at start up and shutdown or when it go into sleep mode some machine allow for you to adjust the length of time before it go into a sleep mode which will decrease the amount of water used a for how often the drip tray need to be emptied that is totally up to how often the machine enters in and out of these mode and size of the drip tray,whole latte love nope that is the rinse cycle you are seeing right now actually,this thing look like it us a ton of water to clean itself how frequent are these cycle and how often do you have to empty the drip tray,really great job guy thank you so much for such an informative and helpful video,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,how can i get more coffee in the single cup,esam show an outstanding extraction time especially being compared to barista pro,you can choose the intensity of the espresso shot on delonghi from extra mild to extra strong you got like at least 5 type of taste multiplied with 7 grind setting so please do not say that breville is better you did not even tried on delonghi to do any adjustment on ebay you can find refurbished magnifica s for gbp200 for this money trust me that it will meet your expectation 100percent buy some nice bean from coffee roaster local and you will be happy,i really like your informative video and service to u coffee lover in trying to understand different machine i would agree that the ease of use cleanliness and overall quality of the delonghi is superior,i really like her informative video and service to u coffee lover in trying to understand different machine i would agree that the ease of use cleanliness and overall quality of the delonghi is superior,i have a dairy allergy issue so i can not use regular milk so are any of these machine able to use something like oatmilk or some of the other non dairy milk,hi gail great wouldown to earth review a usual on the breville are there any plastic part inside the machine that get in contact with hot water or coffee i heard there is a plastic under the filter on the actual portafilter can you confirm thanks,i had a breville for 11 year always great coffee after it started leaking 11 year of use just think about the quality of the machine i went to a delonghi magnifica s mainly due to people coming in to the house and not knowing how to use the breville all i can say is the delonghi is a nice machine keep bench clean but disappointed in the coffee it make it weak and doe not have the nice full bodied flavor the breville is produce im sure it a combination of the amount and quality of grind preinfusion method water temp portafilter and the micro froth that make the big difference over the delonghi you can definitely tell when pour the milk much much darker on the breville and if go more boutique bean you can taste the difference not so much with the delonghi where most bean taste the same but quality bean do make a difference with strength and extraction on the delonghi so i guess if love the flavor of coffee and like the manual process go the breville if want a clean work area and want coffee more for the hit then go the delonghi in a perfect world and will prob happen is would have both i have tried coffee on extremely expensive automatic machine and the result is about the same a a delonghi i have made better coffee on the breville than what i have had from many many coffee shop,what worry me about braville is the temperature i have read many people commenting that the temperature is very low which make me think about other option,really helped best review comment thanks,the biggest convenience with a super auto is you do not have to clean the portafilter every time you make a shot i just bought a super auto to replace my nespresso and i am so excited gail is giving me so much info,hi thank you for all your helpful review i just got the magnifica but do not know good bean can you suggest,dystoniaify thanks i am in canada so not sure about how the cost will work out for me but look good do you only use espresso bean i have been using just dark whole bean coffee in mine for some pretty bold coffee bean are not oily a best i have read those are the one that gum up the machine so i have tried to stick to one basically dry,how do you like it i just found one on craigslist with a 6 month warranty for dollar300 i live in the pacific nw try stumptown it is my favorite local,i love a drink 5 shot on ice i always get half decaf stuck on which machine to buy the one seems easy the other is not i like the idea of being able to use decaf and caff,hi gail i just purchase the breville pro and still trying to figure out the setting to get a great latte so watching your tip really help thank you,thanks for the comparsion i really glad to see gail but i think you need to compare more comparable model for e ample espresso machine de longhi la specialista we have this model in russia and i hope you have it too in usa and breville barista in russia it called bork i will be happy if you do that it will be a really honest test,so there still is not a single fully automatic espresso machine that would make a decent espresso shot not trying to compare it to something much more expensive but seems like even a dollar100 semi automatic espresso machine pull out a better shot than a dollar1000 fully automatic one right the main complains about the fully automatic one no matter if they are dollar300 or dollar1500 is poor control over the shot usually more watery than it should be even when you choose the strongest possible setting in regard to coffee strength poor temperature often not a hot a it should be more time for warming up more water consumption overall not a big deal but no a nice feature either quite poor steam wand and therefore milk foam etc i would like a fully automatic one but not at the cost of a watery and warm cup of espresso i have little control over,on the magnifica you can stream without the panarello take the silver part off for much much more closer to professional steamed milk and control over it,i have one of the older delonghi machine the magnifica x and i am able to remove just the shiny metal sleeve on the steam wand just like you did in the video and i steam with it off in doing so i am able to have better control over the amount of air i put into the milk just like a normal steam wand have you tried steaming without the metal sleeve if not can you give it a go and let u know what you think also instead of brewing a double shot in the magnifica i dialed in the perfect grind dose and water amount for a single shot and would then pull a single shot twice i end up with a pretty flavorful latte if you have the chance can you try dialing in and pulling a single shot twice and let u know how it go for you love your video and hello from a fellow seattlian,i have the esam 3300 and i do not think you gave the delonghi a fair evaluation and would you please stop interrupting the brewing process you did it constantly on your older video the esam make a delicious cup of coffee you were much kinder on your older video,agreed she seems somewhat biased i have a 10 yr old esam 3200 and can attest to it amazing track record capacity to make pretty darn good shot with decent crema and bang for buck value,this review reminds me when i wa torn between buying a jeep wrangler or a smart car they are just do similar,you probably need to do first the coffee then the milk that way you do not need to wait till the boiler get colder,interesting and relevant comparison but having recently purchased the 220v version of the delonghi esam 4200s which seems to only differ on minor cosmetic point i think you are selling the full auto a bit short it ha 13 grind setting numbered 1 to 7 with intermediate position click the bean hopper is smaller than stated it is around 1 2 lb 200g per the operating manual the panarello can be removed a shown for cleaning in which case one can get much better foam with experience and skill a is the case with any machine assuming the dial setting on the display model and mine are comparable i would expect a watery coffee with too little coffee for the amount of water setting the water dial to 9 00 and the coffee dial to 3 00 would give much better result slightly over 1oz in the cup with around 9g of dried coffee ground for best result i would recommend purging the steam wand and then inserting it into the milk container push the steam button and wait for the light before purging after steaming milk and turning off the steam button i suggest purging the steam wand for a few second until water come out of it the machine is then ready for coffee in second it is not a perfect machine it is a bit plasticky compared to the gaggia titanium it replaced at home the water tank is small the steam wand only swivel and it requires some tuning to give good result the range of the coffee and especially water amount is excessively large but with some tlc it make pretty good coffee and work well the startup time is fairly short probably because plastic ha little thermal inertia cleaning is very simple it lack some comfort feature compared to other full automatic presets autostart informative lcd display etc but it provides fine control which some of the fancier machine lack i understand that it is pretty reliable hopefully it will beat the 14 year i got from the gaggia and that the internals are identical to the fancier delonghi model which make me feel smug i am silent on the 4 setting temperature control a temperature seems to vary quite a bit from pour to pour unfortunately hot water is delivered on the steam wand at a consistent 90c 195f but brewed coffee in cup vary from 58 135f to 65 150f depending on setting and shot overall not much to complain for the price,francois lafaix agree with your comment i have a previous magnifica model 3200 over 10 yr old daily tasty shot of 2 4 espresso with great crema sure theyre not a good a a fully manual 2000dollar plus machine however the convenience to taste factor ratio more than make up for it ymmv still going strong after 10 year with only requiring minor maintenance repair of 75 125dollar every 3 year or so by any knowledgable shop,thanks for such an informative comment my workplace ha an old delonghi caffe venezia esam 2200 i believe and to my eye it is largely the same machine the brew unit the grind setting the overall functionality everyone in the office just make watery americanos with it without knowing it full potential,hehehehe she said de longhi barista pro at 7 00,woooo nice art d,may you can review a gaggia classic,thermal block not boiler,the barista pro just look so much better lt 3,caleb standley you only need it for the loo try a solution that is build in the kitchen shelf of old fashion look,i have the machine on the right and my parent have the one on the left the one on the right is my favorite because you feel in control however the one on the left is extremely convenient and le messy,melissa they both do the same but i feel like the automatic is harder to dial in i am biased tho love my breville,which one doe a better espresso shot,do more breville oracle touch comparison also can you do a video using bulk coffee from costco like cameron is velvet moon and how you would make it taste better rather than always getting fresh bean i know fresh is the best but i have never seen a video using bulk thank you,sara mahmoud bean are personal flavor not all have the same taste development here not all people need fresh bean they do sell premium quality coffee in sealed pack that last a year without loosing it taste i still need fresh bean or do that myself 2 crack,i miss clem,i actually work in the same building a brandywine coffee roaster,totally off topic but gale need to do a video on this,i have just got a rocket appartamento but i am still watching this review because gail,i love the appartamento,appartamento take 15 min to warm up a complete dealbreaker for me,can you do one with barista pro v dual boiler i am curio about the 54mm portafilter espresso v 58mm portafilter espresso flavor,i have the neville dual boiler with the breville smart grinder dual boiler doe coffee so much faster and give you the opportunity to really dial in the machine to give you an excellent shot i love this chanel i live in australia and breville is an australian company p s i wa in seattle 2 year ago and i loved it really nice city space needle wa amazing,mck the oracle can be put in auto or manual steaming mode you can adjust the amount of coffee it come preset to 22g,bobbie deal but oracle ha a different steaming wand worse for steaming and it always give 22g for double espresso you can not control it from what i have heard,jules the oracle is a auto manual machine you select latte cap etc dual boiler doe not have that that is the difference my opinion the oracle is the better machine,eddie luna a better comparison would be a breville dual boiler compared to anbreville oracle both of these machine are dual boiler,very very nice review a always thank you lot if i were to buy a coffee machine between these two then my choice would definitely be the breville one definitely but i will just stick to my old fashion different size of moka pot along with the superb daily freshly grounded coffee from croplines coffee here in launceston tasmania no other coffee come even close ha ha many many happy greeting to you and all viewer around the globe love your video nara,i really like the barista pro the drink even looked full bodied le milky then the magnifica could you revisit a crew review on the breville dual boiler i am thinking about upgrading to that or a rocket machine down the road,curious why you do not start by brewing coffee before steaming the milk it would avoid waiting for the boiler to heat up for steam and then cool down for brew,smachsimo the mixing of creama with cream process you need the coffee to be a fresh a you can milk can wait on 100 c for you to finish the coffee,the espresso will die the milk can sit and settle all the bubble the espresso will change and could go bitter sour,nima akhtar khavari not sure about the logic if you start with milk it is going to cool down while you are pulling the shot,i am loving this channel and am heartbroken that i do not live anywhere close to seattle d,is there any difference on the barista pro having the smaller porta filter size,jay g why you all think porta filter size is a matter here these are pressurized machine real science class is needed le footprint in the porta filter more pressure other fuzzy logic circuit in the ic le original then the old day sill good use the coffee a a filter try do do one post now you all say filter size unable to reply this way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

very helpful thank you for giving me some image of how set up the machine i have some question for an experienced user i have seen the water filter water softener is it included i guess and how ofter do you change it we have quite hard water recently we use that egg shaped krups coffee maker for capsule and we do not use any water filter so i do not know how about this one and how about decalcification how often and with which substance i have heard these official product are expensive i have found some recommendation in discussion to not use citric acid because it is agressive is it but lactic acid in 40percent solution with water we use citric acid for our kettle to decalc it no problem but this machine is waay more expensive so i do not want to break it of course d so i am wondering how much there will be additional cost for filter water softener if any etc could you please give u some recommendation of your own experience and sorry for many question here thank you,filter not included but you can but similar one on internet i also fill the water reservoir from a separate water jug which ha it own filter so double filtered,too slow for the morning rush,thanks

in of uitschakelen daarom laat ik hem ook gewoon aanstaan in eco stand al we thuis zijn en heb ik hem ingesteld op automatisch uitschakelen na een uur zonder gebruik al deze dingen kan je makkelijk

16,the machine wa designed to not need lubrican not when you wash it you can open and close the basket mechanism whilst under water in the sink and it clean it use 2 to 3 drop of dishwasher liquid to break the water tension if needed if it is not working because it is jamming you could just replace it,mine wa working for more than a year just by washing it then it began to stick and jam up that is why i used olive oil to lubricate it but now i have found some replacement rubber seal to service it with,about the comment lodged by shaw you read them and were humbly open to the advice excellent job chap,sorry but that is not good advice you need to pop the clip and silicone grease the orings or replace if necessary using veg oil to grease the outside of the piston is almost useless,i agree i have replacement ring and food safe silicon type grease the initial video wa designed to be a quick fix which in reality ha to be done quite often i do intend to do an update which is more lasting,thanks crazy chef i wa about to go crazy on my machine and would of needed a new one lol,you are the man same issue with my stuff just pas thanks ma men,while you had the infuser removed why on earth did not you remove the plastic clip push out the piston and clean and silicon grease the two o ring around the piston any form of vegetable oil should not be used a it can affect the o ring in the infuser only a food grade silicon lubrican not should be used removing the two o ring from the piston and cleaning and lubricating them is the single most important maintenance item on the infuser,the crazy chef you are humble and open to the advice of others good job chap,sound advice,thanks for the feedback i didnt realise you could get food safe silicon grease i see now you can also buy the o ring for the magnifica so i will do another video thanks again,you did not clean the most important thing which is the gasket and you should put food safe grease round the gasket,the crazy chef you can unscrew the screw good idea to do this and clean the metal filter i have just ordered some silicon grease there are video showing how to easily take the infusion part apart and you can grease the o ring a others have said,on reflection i take your point but i didnt want to unscrew the crosshead screw to see it the top came off something to try out have you done that and wa everything ok,crazy chef is a leader of men,you should not use oil of any kind only use food safe grease it lubricates far better and last much longer on the plastic surface,it cooking oil have tried othet stuff,my infuser is stuck what should i do,if not damaged place it in some warm water to soak then try pressing the top down to loosen it up apply some vegetable oil to loosen it up i am assuming you can take it out of the machine,hi i am about to order one on these machine and this will be handy vid for future maintenance thank i am limited for counter space and so intend to leave the drip tray off when not in use can you please tell me the distance the corner of the machine without drip tray would be if it wa pushed flush to the back wall,old comment i know but for anyone else thinking of buying the machine will not function if the drip tray grind bin is not fitted although it just a simple switch and could probably be modified to bypass would not recommend it a the machine doe rinse cycle periodically and will cut out once the drip tray is full to stop flooding it a good machine the coffee is great only gripe is there is no easy way to remove old bean from the grinder compartment,the depth from the back to the front without the drip tray is 25 5cm or 10 inch the width of the device without the drip tray is 28cm or 11 inch note that the power cable come out of the back of the machine but is flexible but may need a small amount of clearance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
