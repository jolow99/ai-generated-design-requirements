145,hey i bought a magnifica s used on the internet here in sweden the owner had used the machine a few time and wa not happy with the result and put it back in the original box and sold it after a month i myself like espresso and latte and therefore over the year had several full manual and semi automatic espresso machine the latest purchase wa a bambino plus sage breville for my daughter doe not like brewed coffee and thought she could fix breakfast coffee herself with the bambino when i no longer had the opportunity to make coffee for her because we got up at different time in the morning it did not work for her despite the semi automatic bambino wa very easy to use i thought that is why i bought the almost fully automatic magnifica s it went well for her i became curious about how well you could set the right coffee grinding and amount of water so i used a whole afternoon to regulate the mill amount of water and the slider for intensity i think it regulates the amount that may need to be adjusted depending on the type of coffee you use and how coarse or fine the grinding is to improve the coffee and wa quite surprised at how much better it could be today i also use the machine every day when i am in a hurry and use the others when i have more time ok it doe not make barista made coffee but the result is very good for such a cheap machine i paid 100 dollar for a almost new maskin,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.7315638065338135, 0.1621437966823578, 0.1062924787402153]"

167,not impressed with built quality durability of material used by delonghi i bought a prima donna esam6900m 4 year ago and it is quite frustrating to see that multiple plastic part have started to disintegrate i had to completely refurbish the grinder unit because of a plastic part that decided to come off and found it way into the internals i would expect that from a cheap machine but from a quality brand like delonghi i deem this unacceptable,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.7937673330307007, 0.17451874911785126, 0.03171389922499657]"
168,coffee kev well actually it wa a load of different part to sum it up it started with the hinge of the lid of the bean container then the little key at the back of the drip tray that signal wether or not the drip tray is in place and one of the mounting point of the upper housing gave way that last happened the moment i had to disassemble the machine in order to salvage the coffee grinder unit which completely derailed after a piece of the bean lid hinge dropped in to top it off the diffuser started to show serious sign of incontinence a well no aggressive cleaning agent were ever used on the machine unfortunately the drip tray alone cost about 90 gbp to replace so repair by delonghi themselves is deemed to be economically unviable superglue absolute patience and extreme care during maintenance will be key to keep the coffee machine running until i have the budget for a more professional espresso set up probably the delonghi ha a limited capacity i bought the machine on the 15th of april 2019 and produced 10345 drink mainly espresso with it that is just over 11 cup of espresso on average per day would that be too much for a consumer machine,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5470011830329895, 0.3315086364746094, 0.12149015069007874]"

250,i have the same machine make an acceptable cup of coffee when using the strongest bean and set to produce the strongest coffee though the coffee is nothing to write home about being not particularly hot and not particularly strong however the really poor aspect of the machine is it design with respect to cleaning it really seems to have been designed to make it cleaning a difficult a possible some of the used ground fall outside the removable container into which they are supposed to fall so the inside of the machine which is full of nook and cranny becomes very dirty the ground container itself is designed not to be easily cleaned and the drip tray is a total disaster of design seemingly made to be a difficult a possible to clean and then to dry not recommended,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.5993702411651611, 0.34174853563308716, 0.058881185948848724]"

258,useful to watch prior to purchase one thing that doe put me off is that i seek the traditional scream of milk scolded with a proper espresso machine is steam wand i also note that in this video clip the wand is neither wiped after use nor purged prior to being placed in the jug of milk if one is spending so much money on a top of the line coffee machine it is worth taking the trouble to find out how to correctly steam milk for coffee that require it i understand from a barista that some will use a thermometer to ensure the right uniform milk temperature while others judge it is correct when the jug is too hold to hold such video a this would be even better if updated after a few month of experience is gained,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.554057776927948, 0.4198288917541504, 0.026113400235772133]"

299,just to let first time user know that you have to make 3 cup before you get a decent flow until then it tends to drip i thought it wa due to me having the bean grinder setting too fine but i think it wa just sorting itself out give it a few cup and it should be fine,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.8272243142127991, 0.12637574970722198, 0.04639989137649536]"

303,darren altman hi darren i am glad you like the review honestly it took a little playing around with the machine to get the strength to my preference for a true americano dispense some hot water in to your cup from the wand if you use the wand without pressing the steam button it dispenses hot water and then put it under the coffee spout and add a shot of strong coffee for a long coffee we tend to put strength to around half and cup size to max and press 1 or 2 cup depending on the mug size hope that help,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7999560236930847, 0.1559119075536728, 0.044132132083177567]"

330,yeah i keep the ground coffee amount cranked all the way up the water volume i typically keep half way up and just manually stop brewing at around 2oz the best way to get a dial in on a super automatic is to just use time and volume since you can not really weigh anything so shoot for 2oz out in about 20 to 27 second at first drip honestly it is hard to over extract in this machine generally speaking since it us a pressurized filter basket generally my grind size is at 2 or 3,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.7915810942649841, 0.15598122775554657, 0.052437640726566315]"

364,i had the issue where the process would not start light flashing steam valve opened but then nothing i left the machine in that state for about 15 minute and the machine powered itself off same a if you leave machine on after making a drink once off i powered back on and pressed the descale button light flashing a per video then reopened the milk frother but quicker than previously rather than move it slowly a i did before and the descale process ha started this time no idea if machine reset itself after it powered off or by opening the milk valve quickly ha resolved issue but hope this could help others,"['video', 'usability', 'not usability']","[0.7013401985168457, 0.26503339409828186, 0.03362639248371124]"

366,for those that wonder why it suddenly stop do not do anything yet give it some time and it will continue it is letting the descaling fluid clean the internals before flushing it out wait until the watertank is empty and the light are flashing you can use the flushed out water in your hot kettle so it descales a well tip i got from some comment in here thought i would summarize,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.6672202944755554, 0.17282389104366302, 0.15995588898658752]"

414,interestingly neither the manual nor the video show how much water to add to the 100ml of descaler fluid the manual make no reference at all to it and the video suggests you fill it somewhere towards the maximum mark but not actually up to the maximum mark it would be nice to have something a little more precise,"['video', 'not usability', 'usability']","[0.43411576747894287, 0.42904776334762573, 0.1368364691734314]"

504,i bought a easm4200 due to review like this on youtube my 4200 take 14 minute to make cappuccino apparently according to delonghi this is right now the thing with this is after you have frothed the milk with the steam wand it take 8 minute to heat water to make the coffee itself by which time the frothy milk isnt really frothy so you end up with a flat white but a little thicker if you wish to make 4 coffee one of which requires frothed milk you can say good bye to 20 min also do not use delonghis online web form for support after waiting a fortnight i phoned and initially after waiting 3 min they picked the phone up them promptly put it down when i phoned again after waiting for nearly a long they said do not use the form email u 4 week now and they answered saying it take this amount of time to make a frothy cappuccino really 14 minute for an angry flat white im an honest opinion do not buy this unit if you want a cappuccino for expressos and longs it work anything else do not,"['usability', 'video', 'not usability']","[0.46339476108551025, 0.2789779007434845, 0.25762733817100525]"

641,the coffee quality is indeed great bought from the only misgiving i would have about using it are that the knob have no user marking which mean that if there are several people in the house using the machine it is impossible to select the previously selected individual setting also the time before the machine performs an auto switchoff is fixed at about three hour i could not find the power comsumption in the user manual when in idle mode but i think it must be substantial since it keep the boiler cup preheater hot during this time not that the preheater is any use i warm my cup by first wetting them and then putting them in the microwave for 30 second,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.449296236038208, 0.4490165114402771, 0.1016872376203537]"

663,i had a breville for 11 year always great coffee after it started leaking 11 year of use just think about the quality of the machine i went to a delonghi magnifica s mainly due to people coming in to the house and not knowing how to use the breville all i can say is the delonghi is a nice machine keep bench clean but disappointed in the coffee it make it weak and doe not have the nice full bodied flavor the breville is produce im sure it a combination of the amount and quality of grind preinfusion method water temp portafilter and the micro froth that make the big difference over the delonghi you can definitely tell when pour the milk much much darker on the breville and if go more boutique bean you can taste the difference not so much with the delonghi where most bean taste the same but quality bean do make a difference with strength and extraction on the delonghi so i guess if love the flavor of coffee and like the manual process go the breville if want a clean work area and want coffee more for the hit then go the delonghi in a perfect world and will prob happen is would have both i have tried coffee on extremely expensive automatic machine and the result is about the same a a delonghi i have made better coffee on the breville than what i have had from many many coffee shop,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.6849555969238281, 0.16837994754314423, 0.14666442573070526]"

673,so there still is not a single fully automatic espresso machine that would make a decent espresso shot not trying to compare it to something much more expensive but seems like even a dollar100 semi automatic espresso machine pull out a better shot than a dollar1000 fully automatic one right the main complains about the fully automatic one no matter if they are dollar300 or dollar1500 is poor control over the shot usually more watery than it should be even when you choose the strongest possible setting in regard to coffee strength poor temperature often not a hot a it should be more time for warming up more water consumption overall not a big deal but no a nice feature either quite poor steam wand and therefore milk foam etc i would like a fully automatic one but not at the cost of a watery and warm cup of espresso i have little control over,"['not usability', 'usability', 'video']","[0.5583149194717407, 0.392184853553772, 0.04950018972158432]"

680,interesting and relevant comparison but having recently purchased the 220v version of the delonghi esam 4200s which seems to only differ on minor cosmetic point i think you are selling the full auto a bit short it ha 13 grind setting numbered 1 to 7 with intermediate position click the bean hopper is smaller than stated it is around 1 2 lb 200g per the operating manual the panarello can be removed a shown for cleaning in which case one can get much better foam with experience and skill a is the case with any machine assuming the dial setting on the display model and mine are comparable i would expect a watery coffee with too little coffee for the amount of water setting the water dial to 9 00 and the coffee dial to 3 00 would give much better result slightly over 1oz in the cup with around 9g of dried coffee ground for best result i would recommend purging the steam wand and then inserting it into the milk container push the steam button and wait for the light before purging after steaming milk and turning off the steam button i suggest purging the steam wand for a few second until water come out of it the machine is then ready for coffee in second it is not a perfect machine it is a bit plasticky compared to the gaggia titanium it replaced at home the water tank is small the steam wand only swivel and it requires some tuning to give good result the range of the coffee and especially water amount is excessively large but with some tlc it make pretty good coffee and work well the startup time is fairly short probably because plastic ha little thermal inertia cleaning is very simple it lack some comfort feature compared to other full automatic presets autostart informative lcd display etc but it provides fine control which some of the fancier machine lack i understand that it is pretty reliable hopefully it will beat the 14 year i got from the gaggia and that the internals are identical to the fancier delonghi model which make me feel smug i am silent on the 4 setting temperature control a temperature seems to vary quite a bit from pour to pour unfortunately hot water is delivered on the steam wand at a consistent 90c 195f but brewed coffee in cup vary from 58 135f to 65 150f depending on setting and shot overall not much to complain for the price,"['usability', 'not usability', 'video']","[0.540715754032135, 0.248741015791893, 0.2105432003736496]"
